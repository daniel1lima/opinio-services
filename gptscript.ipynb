I was intimidated to try this style of working out but it was so worth it. All of the instructors are amazing and I've already learned so much. I love how you are taught not to rush through the exercises, you are motivated to increase your weight and overall are provided great quality workouts. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to improve their overall health through strength training! I would give 10 stars if I could.\"\n",
