This cute place has that diner/greasy spoon feel. There were only two square tables and a small table inside, which could probably accommodate 8-10 people. We were greeted as soon as we walked in around 1:20 pm. Despite a supply delivery just finishing the older gentleman was very friendly. \n\nWe weren\'t starving so we decided to split a Pearl\'s Deluxe burger with cheese and shared an order of "Springs" (1/2 sweet potato fries and 1/2 onion rings). Our food came out quickly and they were able to cut the burger in half and brought us an extra basket (plate).\n\nThe bun had A LOT of sesame seeds and the top bun was pretty thick as you can see in the cross-section picture. But the bun was actually light and airy and held everything together pretty well. The burger was seasoned well and tender.

I added some cheese and ketchup to it which made it even more delicious. Each bite of the burger would release some of the juice which is a bit messy but shows just how fresh and good the burger was. Now for the fries, The fries were extremely delicious and crispy 9/10. I feel like this place would be known for the fries out of everything. \n\nOverall, This burger spot was extremely good and would 100% recommend to anyone wanting a cheeseburger.', 'review_url': 'No Url', 'rating': 4.0, 'total_reviews': 2421, 'platform_id': 'Yelp', 'assigned_label': [3], 'named_labels': ['delicious'], 'sentiment': 3.7381944444, 'polarity': 4.1527777778}

The "mini" burgers are quarter pound. \nThe gentleman who took my order delivered the burger and placed a napkin dispenser on the table. I have had burgers all over the northern hemisphere and was indoctrinated to Solly\'s hamburgers in Milwaukee at a young age. The mushroom burger from Pearl\'s was as good as the other "best" burgers I have had. Freshly cooked and very juicy patty on a nice seeded bun. The mushrooms were plentiful and freshly cooked. I ended up needing four napkins even after cutting the burger in half so it was easier to handle. Probably that was sacrilegious but I did not want to lose any bit of burger. \nPearl\'s Deluxe Burgers is a great place and I must return the next time I am in San Francisco.', 'review_url': 'No Url', 'rating': 5.0, 'total_reviews': 2421, 'platform_id': 'Yelp', 'assigned_label': [0], 'named_labels': ['burgers'], 'sentiment': 2.9872271825, 'polarity': 3.6978753307}

We hoofed it over from the Van Ness side on a personal recommendation and it was definitely worth the effort. You\'re only a few blocks from Union Square going the other direction so it\'s not nowhere for sure. Anyhow, the burgers are really quite good, with the standard build your own option and several  "specialty" offerings as well. I generally like to opt for just a standard cheeseburger when I try a place for the first time as this will tell me for sure whether they can make a good tasting burger that\'s not hidden in the flavors of BBQ, bleu cheese, sautéed onions etc.. (not that there\'s anything wrong with those of course.) Here at Pearls they can definitely make a good burger. Cooked to a solid medium with nice flavor and good texture. I\'m not a big condiment guy but this burger was nice and juicy even without the mayo :-) ( sorry to the dude that gave 1 star because the burger was too moist and not dry and crumbly) Can\'t wait to go back and try the Kobe option and maybe one of the specialty burgers, the Prized Pearl is looking pretty darn good', 'review_url': 'No Url', 'rating': 5.0, 'total_reviews': 2421, 'platform_id': 'Yelp', 'assigned_label': [1], 'named_labels': ['burger'], 'sentiment': 3.139520202, 'polarity': 3.8613215488}

You\'re only a few blocks from Union Square going the other direction so it\'s not nowhere for sure. Anyhow, the burgers are really quite good, with the standard build your own option and several  "specialty" offerings as well. I generally like to opt for just a standard cheeseburger when I try a place for the first time as this will tell me for sure whether they can make a good tasting burger that\'s not hidden in the flavors of BBQ, bleu cheese, sautéed onions etc..

Pearls can remind you of their significance in like 30 different flavors. The burgers are very good but not quite elite. There are better burgers in the city but if you live/work in the area then Pearls will make you very happy. They have all sorts of combos of fries, sweet potato fries and onion rings. I will save you the trouble. Just get the onion rings. They are as homemade as a fried onion could be. Keep up the good work Pearls. You have an important job to do. \n(4.4 Stars)', 'review_url': 'No Url', 'rating': 4.0, 'total_reviews': 2421, 'platform_id': 'Yelp', 'assigned_label': [2], 'named_labels': ['fries'], 'sentiment': 3.4, 'polarity': 4.0863636364}

OMG so glad we did!  I was in the mood for a good cheeseburger and had just mentioned to a friend that I wanted to make burgers tomorrow for Mem Day.  Well, I got my burger fix a day early!\n\nWe each ordered a Pearl deluxe with cheese well done and a large order of fries (recommend sharing such as we did as it's enough for 2).  Burgers and fries were freshly made to order.  Burger was juicy, hot, and flavorful.  Fries were crispy and had a unique coating but neither salty nor greasy.  The only downside is it's pricey but expected in Union Square.  Definitely come support this mom and pop establishment.  Your tummy and taste buds will be happy and you'll be glad you did!", 'review_url': 'No Url', 'rating': 5.0, 'total_reviews': 2421, 'platform_id': 'Yelp', 'assigned_label': [2], 'named_labels': ['fries'], 'sentiment': 3.156512605, 'polarity': 4.099789916}

This cute place has that diner/greasy spoon feel. There were only two square tables and a small table inside, which could probably accommodate 8-10 people. We were greeted as soon as we walked in around 1:20 pm. Despite a supply delivery just finishing the older gentleman was very friendly. \n\nWe weren\'t starving so we decided to split a Pearl\'s Deluxe burger with cheese and shared an order of "Springs" (1/2 sweet potato fries and 1/2 onion rings). Our food came out quickly and they were able to cut the burger in half and brought us an extra basket (plate).\n\nThe bun had A LOT of sesame seeds and the top bun was pretty thick as you can see in the cross-section picture. But the bun was actually light and airy and held everything together pretty well. The burger was seasoned well and tender. It was cooked perfectly to a medium temperature. \n\nIf you\'re more adventurous they have many burger varieties to choose from, plus salads, and shakes.  They have fountain sodas as well as canned and bottled water, juices, and sodas. \n\nA great little hole-in-the-wall place to try that\'s reasonably priced and away from the Union Square hustle and bustle.', 'review_url': 'No Url', 'rating': 4.0, 'total_reviews': 2421, 'platform_id': 'Yelp', 'assigned_label': [0], 'named_labels': ['burger'], 'sentiment': 3.1933333333, 'polarity': 4.04}

This cute place has that diner/greasy spoon feel. There were only two square tables and a small table inside, which could probably accommodate 8-10 people. We were greeted as soon as we walked in around 1:20 pm. Despite a supply delivery just finishing the older gentleman was very friendly. \n\nWe weren\'t starving so we decided to split a Pearl\'s Deluxe burger with cheese and shared an order of "Springs" (1/2 sweet potato fries and 1/2 onion rings). Our food came out quickly and they were able to cut the burger in half and brought us an extra basket (plate).\n\nThe bun had A LOT of sesame seeds and the top bun was pretty thick as you can see in the cross-section picture. But the bun was actually light and airy and held everything together pretty well. The burger was seasoned well and tender. It was cooked perfectly to a medium temperature. \n\nIf you\'re more adventurous they have many burger varieties to choose from, plus salads, and shakes.
