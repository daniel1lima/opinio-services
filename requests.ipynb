       "  'review_text': 'As mentioned in my previous review of the YMCA, it\\'s a great gym, but the people there are just HORRIBLE, hence the two stars.  (If I didn\\'t encounter such awful people, I\\'d give the gym at least four stars.)  There\\'s the relatively minor annoyance of people talking VERY LOUDLY on their phone or to their friend while on the exercise floor or machines; there are guys who throw basketballs at people in the gym (last week, my friend got hit in the head, very hard); there are people like in my last review who are complete assholes and have no business being out in public; and last night, some loser who was drinking a bright blue drink from a plastic cup (it looked like melted slurpee or Naked Grape Blue) and spilled it all over the ground in the atrium, right in front of the turnstiles to get into the gym.  I saw him look at the floor, see the sticky mess he had made, shrug his shoulders, and just walked off.  Ugh.  (I reported the spill to staff so that they could clean it up, and prevent someone from slipping.)  And a couple of weeks ago, I was harassed by some creep.\\n\\nI was on a treadmill, and four minutes into my workout, two obnoxious middle aged men went onto the empty treadmills beside me.  While they weren\\'t being creepy, they were talking excessively loud, practically yelling, as if they were in some nightclub.  (While there is a lot of background noise at the YMCA from people using the machines and talking, it\\'s a relatively quiet gym - which is something I like - as they don\\'t blast music on the exercise floor, which is what other gyms seem to do.)  Not wanting to put up with their yelling for the duration of my workout, I stopped the machine at the five minute mark and started gathering my stuff to leave.  As I was gathering my things and getting off the machine, the guy right beside me started talking at me (and I also had earphones on), and asked me my name.\\n\\nFUCK OFF, ASSHOLE.  DO NOT TALK TO ME FOR NO REASON.  AND WHY THE HELL SHOULD I GIVE YOU MY NAME, WHEN YOU DON\\'T EVEN BOTHER TO OFFER ME YOURS?  (Not that I wanted to know his name.  But demanding someone give them their name without introducing yourself is fucking RUDE.)\\n\\nNow, for the guys who are clueless and don\\'t understand why this was upsetting, it\\'s not that I have a problem with people talking to me or asking me a question, regardless of gender or age.  It\\'s because in this situation, this guy had NO REASON to talk to me; he didn\\'t say, \"Excuse me...\" to indicate a question, nor did he say something, such as an observation he wanted to share with me.  He right out demanded to know what MY name, a personal piece of information, was, as if I owed him an answer.  And he did so when he noticed that I was walking away.  Awww, I guess creepy guy was disappointed that he wouldn\\'t be working out beside a hot chick.  (Which is entirely his own fault - if he hadn\\'t been so fucking loud and obnoxious, I wouldn\\'t have been leaving.  But since he turned out to be a creep, it was a good thing I was leaving when I was, because I would have been extra pissed off if in the middle of my workout I had to leave due to harassment.)\\n\\nGuys - just because you see a woman that YOU\\'RE attracted to doesn\\'t mean that you are entitled to speak to her.  She is under no obligation to satisfy YOUR wants, and if you can clearly see that she doesn\\'t want to talk to you, STFU.  While it\\'s OK to strike up a conversation with someone, it is fucking creepy and obnoxious to start talking at a woman, who is minding her own business, simply because she is a woman, and if you don\\'t really have anything to say.  Women know the difference between friendly chitchat and creeps hitting on them.\\n\\nI reported this creep to the YMCA staff, but of course the useless staff did nothing.  I wish I could go to the gym, or go to the store, or go about minding my own fucking business, without some creep harassing me.  \\n\\n[Yelp collections: Fitness]',\n",

The only reasons I'm leaving a 4 star is because YMCA only has 4 locations. Robert Lee being the best, the Langara one is okay. However Langara is pretty outdated with their locker room and is always packed full of people, much smaller gym with less equipment, and has poor ventilation/very smelly too. \\n\\nI'm aware this is the Robert Lee page however, and the other reason I leave 4 stars is because there was a time my mother died. As the executor, I had to leave town to attend to her estate. The YMCA didn't reimburse me and rudely said it's my fault for not holding the membership. That was honestly the last thing on my mind during such a hard time for me, so they charged the $100 for the 2 months I was out of town anyways. Not good.\",\n",

Luckily, it is a big place with a few levels. \\n\\nThere are rowing machines on the 3rd floor too, as well as a small weight rack that goes up to only 20lb of free weight (or 25lb, I can't remember), but is sometimes less crowded. \\n\\nEven though it gets more crowded than a county zoo, there are usually some free cardio machines available to do your warm up/cool down/cardio portion. Like the zoo, there are all kinds of people here which makes for very interesting people watching if you are doing something dull like walking uphill on a treadmill for 30 mins. Also, the gymnasium is huge and has glass walls so you can look at everyone messing around in there. In fact, the whole layout of this facility is excellently designed in a very open-concept way.

Frankly, that's not my biggest issue.\\n\\nI have a gym in my building, and frankly I joined the YMCA for their squash ladder setup.  Again, I was super stoked about this which didn't last....\\nDue to the crowds, you were lucky if you could book a court a week out and even then, the times would be at 9pm and after.  \\n\\nFurthermore, the squash ladder list of participants was removed and supposedly was replaced by online system.  The Y never emailed several of us to let us know the new details.    Seems like they need to sort out their service issues before they bring even more people into the gym...\\n\\nI dropped my membership 3 months into this experiment...\\n\\nDon't get my wrong, the concept of the Y is awesome.

For me this is a great place to work out and relax, they are not about getting huge, there are no free weights above 100lbs. The Y is all about a healthy life style for everyone if you are 80lbs or 400lbs everyone is welcome, it's all about life style improvement.\\n\\nI am currently doing 2-adays...swimming in the AM and running/weights in the PM.

       "  'review_text': 'I used to be a regular at the Robert Lee before I moved. It is a really great facility, the equipment is all new and well taken care of. The space itself is pretty cool with a few different free-weight and machine areas, a studio room, a pool, and the basketball court all on different levels integrated with the Y offices and spaces throughout. They offer regular and plus-member(for extra per-month) changing rooms which is cool.. Even just the regular changing rooms were clean, and nice. They even had hair dryers which was great. The plus-changing rooms are what you would expect, well even more actually. It has a lounge area, any products you could imagine if you prefer not to bring your own - or forgot something. They had flat-irons and curling irons for your hair.. and a bunch of additional perks. One of the biggest being that it has even more space, and less people while you are trying to do your thing and get ready which is awesome when you are there pre-work and most definitely worth it if you are willing to dish out the extra per month. I only ever used my membership for the gym areas but they offered so many great classes, including yoga classes, all included in the monthly fee. \\n\\nI would always be there Mon-Fri for open at 5:30am and the front desk staff was easily the most pleasant I have ever encountered in any gym. That is a big bonus when you are coming in every day before work. It was a facility I looked forward to visiting first thing in the morning and definitely miss it!',\n",

I was doing personal training at Nash and came to the YMCA because it was closer to home and had a pool.\\n\\nWell, when my personal training was over, I decided it was time to focus on one location over the other, and I'm (mostly) glad that I chose the Y.\\n\\nAs everyone has said, it's a beautiful facility. It's always been very clean and devoid of any undesirable smells that are all too common with public gyms and pools. The front desk staff are all very friendly and attentive. The cafeteria has a lovely, mostly-healthy selection of tasty foods and beverages, although I usually stay away from it when I can because it's hard to justify paying $8 for a tiny sandwich that I could make for $3-4 at home. \\n\\nMy reason for not giving five stars is as follows: My main purpose for going to the Y is the gym. It's clean and has a great assortment of equipment, though it gets very, very busy at specific times of the day. There really isn't a lot of space for doing free weights and it's all too common for someone to walk (uncomfortably) in front of you as you're doing your workout. Gym etiquette seems to drop sharply during these busy periods as well. People will walk directly in front of me and start lifting, blocking my view of the mirror. I realize this isn't really the facility's fault, but they could always consider moving a few of the ellipticals and treadmills from that area of the gym somewhere else to make more space.\\n\\nSo yes, the facility is great. The people who go to this facility are terrible and I hate most of them. So I tend to go at very specific times of the day where I know the gym is going to be dead or more quiet - usually in the early afternoon after lunch time or an hour before they close.\",\n",

       "  'review_text': 'Having done a fair bit of research, I confidently say Equinox is the nicest large gym for the serious gym athlete in Vancouver. It isn\\'t perfect, it isn\\'t cheap, but it is definitely worth the investment. I\\'m just finishing up a three month membership there.\\n\\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS:  When you walk into Equinox you realize it is a temple, the design of the lobby is modern, clean, and inspiring. It also has lots of inviting seating and a long gas fire that is welcoming from the cold and damp of winter.  The locker room is equally well designed; fresh clean fluffy towels everywhere, brightly lit, and a swarm of attendants looking after. Similarly, the workout floor is light, inviting and airy with accents of wood and marble and generally spotless. The staff have clearly been trained to be personable, friendly and deferential. They all have a \"can do\" attitude. And they smile. A lot.\\n\\nENROLLMENT:  Ask for a tour and you will receive one. If you want to work out, having a member vouch for you will get you a day pass. Equinox pricing is pretty flat - don\\'t look to haggle here.  [By contrast, if you want a Steve Nash membership, you should walk in, negotiate your best deal and walk out again. They will follow up with price reductions, hidden deals, and unadvertised specials.] It\\'s expensive, but hey, you deserve something nice.\\n\\nCLIENTELE: Well, they tend to be driven professionals late 20\\'s to early 50\\'s with the occasional celebrity (NPH, the cast of Riverdale, etc.) and gay porn star thrown in.  A large number of just unbelievable ripped and proportioned bodies.  Inspiring for me, although probably intimidating for some. People tend to be very boundaried and focussed.  During rush hour it gets busy, but people tend to be considerate. Similarly in the locker room, it gets tight but people tend to get along and be respectful which makes an enormous difference. I appreciate the fact that the place has a fairly large gay clientele (yup, I\\'m a big old homo) and that the gym is very welcoming. \\n\\nWORKOUT FLOOR:  Lots of state of the art cardio equipment and the standard assortment of machines, weights, racks, kettlebars, ab gadgets etc. Amazingly, I have only seen a machine out of commission once and it was fixed the next day. It helps to avoid the evening rush, but it is nowhere near as bad as at Steve Nash or the YMCA. Some individuals have complained about the trainers occupying equipment; truthfully, the trainers at Equinox are easy going and happy to share - you just got to talk to them.\\n\\nCARDIO CLASSES:  A wide variety are offered, they are challenging but fun. Anything with Geoff Bagshaw is worth trying. Most of the Equinox clientele are cardio bunnies. It is why their percentage body fat is so damn low.  The sign ups for popular classes can be challenging - set your alarms for exactly 26 hours in advance.  But a little bit of planning means you are rarely locked out. Class availability has apparently  improved significantly in the last year.\\n\\nSPIN CLASSES: Spin classes at Equinox range between good and very, very good. They just got new bikes that are fabulous (the old ones had some issues) - the speed shifters are awesome. Monique Blythe is my favorite, directed, deliberate and uplifting.  Angela and Michelle are very good also. Zach is adorable, and fairly solid, but he often digresses to tell you about his astrological sign (Libra), his date last night (bad table manners), and his taste in music (the less said the better). I don\\'t get the whole gamification spin classes (called \"The Pursuit\"), but maybe I\\'m just not young enough.\\n\\nPERSONAL TRAINING:  Equinox has many highly qualified trainers, but be careful to shop before you commit. Pricing is comparable to major gyms in American cities (roughly  CA 120  per session). I worked out with Michael Goodfellow. Easily the best trainer I\\'ve worked out with in the last fifteen years (and there have been quite a few). Intensely focussed on his clients, as sweet as they come, but he will get you to do sh*t that you think is impossible.  He is very in touch with his client\\'s physical limitations and designs programs to compensate and complement their abilities. And he always is wearing great socks!!  I made scary progress in the last three months in both gaining muscle and reducing body fat. Random guys at the gym have told me that can see the difference. Even my mother noticed. Personal training is expensive, but it is an amazing journey.\\n\\nLOCKER ROOM: Nicest locker room I\\'ve ever used. Clean, bright with lots of good products available (Kiehl\\'s mainly).  The lockers have programmable locks which means you don\\'t have bring your own. Big clean showers, great steam and sauna, and a near infinite number of towels.  And it seems to always been clean and well stocked (thank you Omar!). I\\'ve never joined a gym because of the locker room, but it sure doesn\\'t hurt.\\n\\nI\\'m going to miss the place (I\\'m leaving Vancouver), but it was sure fun for three months. Thanks guys!!',\n",

Eventually, I cancelled the membership at GoodLife. \\n\\nWhat made me make the commitment to stick with one gym and pay 3x more a month for Equinox is kind of dumb. I'd figure if the cost was too low. I wouldn't even bother going. So, by paying more and being out of my way. I'd make a conscious effort to make a change. \\n\\nIt worked. I go regularly 3 times a week and spend the entire two hours of free parking there.  I work out for 1.5 hours and spend the last 30 mins in the sauna and shower. \\n\\nI like how they have their own locks for lockers and in case you forget your combo or your locker there is someone there to unlock and help you find your locker.  The change room is regularly cleaned so you don't feel gross walking barefoot to the showers and back. They have plenty of towels. They have Kiel's shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, and face wash, body lotion, face cleanser. So, I don't need to bring my own. They even have single blade shavers (which are horrible, recommend using your own shaver) and Gillette shaving foam. The only thing they don't have is hair gel. They have hair spay.  The mouth wash is not great but I'm thankful they have it. \\n\\nCons: Free parking only available before 9am and after 5pm.\",\n",

       "  'review_text': \"Now that I have been a member for 6 months, I can write a comprehensive review. The straight goods! Pros and Cons...here you go:\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\nToo many trainers on the floor. This morning I counted 12 personal trainers on the floor with 12 people being trained, that's an extra 24 people in the gym. This has a huge impact on space availability to us regular people that don't have trainers. The trainers use a large amount of space each, much more space that a person training on their own. In the mornings (6:30am - 8:30am) there is almost no free space to do lunges, squats or any other exercise that requires a decent range of movement. Also, finding an area on the mat to stretch is difficult because the trainers are using the entire mat area. They pay no mind to others trying to use the space since their only focus is their client. \\n\\nHOT YOGA - is not hot at all. It's slightly warm but certainly not hot. \\n\\nTabata/yoga/Pilates - too many people in the classes at once. There is not adequate space for each person. \\n\\nWaiting in line for the shower and blow dryers - again, very busy in the mornings. If you plan to work out before heading to the office, be prepared for a very crowded change room.\\n\\nNo Step mill. Everything gym on the city has one except for these guys. \\n\\n PROS:\\n\\nMetcon3, Tabata, Boxing, YIN Yoga - great classes! High quality. \\n\\nClean change rooms. Great products. Sauna is nice and hot. LOTS of towels. \\n\\nOpen hours are long enough that you shouldn't have any excuse to miss the gym. \\n\\nJuice bar and lounge area are wonderful. The Juice bar has tasty food and the smoothies are top notch. \\n\\nPlenty of cardio equipment; never had to wait. \\n\\n\\nI've had much better work outs at other clubs in the city. Their business model seems to be selling as much personal training as possible. If you are not interested in PT, i would go somewhere else.\",\n",

Even though they have a dedicated \"Maintain\" crew that keeps place spotless, the managers are often seen picking up towels and trash off the floor every chance they get. The shower room floor is continuously being cleaned. I can walk around barefoot and feel okay about it. As soon as the sink area or the ground becomes wet, you can bet it gets wiped up making it clean and dry all the time.\\n\\nI love that the \"Greet\" team finds a way to always multitask and scan members in even if they are doing other things. I\\'ve never had to wait more than 10s to be checked in even if there\\'s a line up. Its also a nice touch that they always greet you by name.\\n\\nThe weights area isn\\'t very large and there\\'s only one of some types of equipment so its best to go at non peak hours. During busy times, the members here all have been very courteous and are happy to work in between sets. There\\'s a personal trainer that\\'s on duty at all times on the gym floor to help with literally anything from spotting to providing tips, or handing you a small towel if they see you sweating a bit and have no towel. They are not pressured to sell you personal training sessions so its not an awkward experience getting help from them.\\n\\nThe classes here are actually what really makes the price worth it. If you have a Yoga membership elsewhere, then Equinox actually becomes such a good deal when you factor in everything else it offers. Although there isn\\'t yoga around the clock, the yoga classes that do happen throughout the day are by far with some of the best teachers I\\'ve ever met.',\n",

       "  'review_text': \"I've been here for almost 3 months now. The good - it's beautiful inside, with lovely change facilities, towel service, and coded lockers. The last two are pretty important for me because I always seem to forget my lock and towel.\\n\\nThe staff is pretty friendly and it's helpful to have people on the floor that I can ask for a spot. They have a personal training session included when you sign up that I haven't taken advantage of . I did do the Pilates one, and was impressed with Tiffany's level of knowledge and ability to adjust it to my fitness level and her feedback.\\n\\nTheir model seems to be geared more towards personal training and classes. I don't use a lot of those services, so my review is limited to the weight room. The weights area is adequate and has most of your typical equipment. It's much smaller than I'm used to, and can get really crowded if you get stuck there during the after work rush. Because it's small, they don't have room for anything like a sled/prowler, which is too bad. It would be nice if they could add a hip thrusting bench and some more TRXs and cable stacks (they have lots of TRXs but they're in the classrooms.) There is some wasted space with weird gimmicky items like this vibrate-y machine that no one seems to use. Overall it generally gets the job done.\\n\\nThe main issues would be the stretching area - it's specific flooring rather than individual mats you can wipe down, so there's always random hairs and stuff. There are no blinds on the windows so in the afternoon it's like being a bug under a magnifying glass and half of that area is unusable anyway as a result. There's no spray to clean equipment, which is weird so I can't wipe down a bench when I'm done (sorry fellow gym-goers!) The bike racks are under cover so protected from the rain, but are often full so sometimes you have to wander the block a bit.\\n\\nBased on observation of what they have their clients doing/form, the trainers are your typical mixed lot that you see in every gym. I have seen one or two of them doing some activities that border on more physio/rehab work, so there might be a few who have a background in that as well.\\n\\nOn the whole it's nice, but better suited I think for someone who wants ongoing personal training or takes advantage of the unlimited classes.\",\n",

       "  'review_text': \"Equinox is a refined, sexy looking gym. Highlights include Keihl's products, a steam room, sauna, cold eucalyptus towels and regular towels. They have a lot of misc. gym toys like weighted leg weights, rubber bands, foam rollers, etc. \\n\\nTheir open bar parties in their lobby every few months is a nice way to get to know other members too. \\n\\nI personally don't mind paying more for a nice facility. During peak times I can usually get the equipment that I want and that's what matters the most to me. \\n\\nThe staff are always super friendly.\\n\\nThere are cleaning attendants on duty all day so the showers/changing rooms are always being cleaned. \\n\\nThey do have a great class selection.\\n\\nI've had to submit a few medical notes to freeze my membership and that was a seamless process.\\n\\nSo why the 3 star review? I would give this gym 5 stars had a few issues not arose that were handled in a manner that made me feel I was a not a valued member. \\n\\n1. On a Thursday night I left my relatively new runners in the change room. I went to the gym on the Saturday morning and asked for my shoes at the front desk but they were not in the lost and found. I was then advised that Equinox throws things out of the lost and found after only 3 days. Yes, only 3 days. I have a very hard time believing someone stole my runners (most women aren't a size 10 and they weren't the most stylish looking runners). If I had to hedge my bets, there was an internal error and they got disposed of out of their lost and found earlier than the 3 days (it was only 2.5 days by this point). I emailed the gym manager Liz to see if the disposed items went to another area after 3 days but she never responded to my email. She could have spoken to the cleaning staff to see if they found runners. Had they, she would have known if there was an internal error by whoever throws lost and found stuff out.\\n\\n2. I wasn't as happy with the last half of my sessions (out of 10) with my trainer. I will note that I found my trainer to be very knowledgeable so that aspect I was very happy with, however, his accountability lacked. Despite promising multiple times, he never sent me my updated workout plans over the course of several months. Unlike many people who train with trainers to get a good workout in, I only wanted to train with a trainer to work on mastering certain exercises/create a planned workout then re-evaluate every 6-8 weeks. I basically just wanted a trainer to set me up for success.\\n\\nI eventually contacted Roxy (the personal training manager) to talk about switching trainers and to share my disappointment. Her solution was suggesting another trainer (but one tier up so now I have to pay +$10 more a session). She offered 1 complimentary session with the new trainer (which the new trainer had already offered to me personally) so she never really did anything to go above and beyond to compensate for the lack of accountability of my previous trainer. I couldn't remember all the exercises and didn't know the names of the exercises to be able to youtube them again to ensure I was doing them correctly, so the last half of my sessions were hardly useful. She could have made my old trainer do a few complimentary sessions to go over all of those exercises again, or she could have ensured she got plans from that old trainer and passed them onto the new trainer (and comp'd at least 3 new sessions to re-cover all the ground that we covered in those sessions) but she offered me a cookie cutter solution. Equinox, how can your members #committosomething if your member's trainer isn't committed to your member's success? Trainers need to be passionate about their client's success. I want a trainer that wants to see me succeed. A trainer that is on my team. I was not so disappointed that maybe my trainer dropped the ball one too many times as I am with how Equinox handled the situation. Almost any business, if as a customer you have fair grounds for not being satisfied with your meal/your spa service/whatever it might be, they usually redo the meal/spa service for you. But in this case not Equinox. They are charging the highest price in the city for personal training. I don't mind paying good money, but I expect a quality service. It's unacceptable to offer a low level of customer service, particularly when you are providing a premium service. \\n\\nSo to sum up my experience - I think if you just use the gym/classes you'll likely be happy with the gym. You'll probably be happy with your trainer too if you want them to give you a good 1 hour workout (I recommend only doing tier 2+). \\n\\nHowever, if something goes wrong in your experience with your trainer or anything else in general, based on my experience you can't necessarily expect Equinox to go above and beyond to show you they value you as a member. It's unfortunate. Equinox has all the potential to build a loyal client base but they don't seem to see the value in stepping up to the plate in moments of imperfection.\",\n",

I take training quite seriously and was looking for a gym that was open 24 hours and had decent equipment, so this fit the bill perfectly.  I came to this location for 2.5 years and loved it. \\n\\nEquipment was always clean, and if it was ever down, it was never down for over a week. Maintenance and cleanliness were top-notch were a gym. There were more than enough accessories such as foam rollers and workout bands, etc. as well. \\n\\nThe staff are incredibly friendly and always greet you if you're in during their hours. There's always personal training available to you and my favorite part is that they're busy, but never ABSOLUTELY packed like other gyms have been.\\n\\nI've since walked into many, many Anytime Fitness locations and this one is by FAR the cleanest, best-run location I've ever seen. I would come back here in a heartbeat. I really can't complain about anything at this location! Even the clientele at this location is super respectful, which made my experience at the gym a lot more comfortable.\\n\\nThe ONLY downfall is that it's a bit pricey, but this isn't exactly location-dependent; the entire chain charges $50~/month+.\",\n",

I moved to Vancouver about a year ago and he was very helpful in getting the administrative side of my account changed. Greg is frequently in the club, often working out with his son!\\n\\nThe club has very nice equipment and there is plenty to choose from; For cardio there are Bikes (both recumbent and upright), elliptical, ergs, stair steppers, treadmills, and more. For lifting there are free weights, various isolation machines, multiple squat racks, kettle bells, smith machine, and more. If you're into Plyo there is an entire studio of equipment you can use.\\n\\nSome of the more niche gear like a hack-squat is missing, but if you're well seasoned at the gym or ask an anytime trainer, there are plenty of other exercises that work similar muscles.\\n\\nI will say, there is a rush hour, on no fault of the gym. It's not unmanageable, but if you're an introvert the right after work time might not be right for you. All other times, especially early mornings are quite manageable.\\n\\nA month or so ago my workouts were more sluggish than ever, and I remembered what it felt like to really kill a workout, so I made an appointment for a personal trainer--Lucy! Lucy has a great repertoire of exercises--every workout with her is motivating and I am always completely drenched in sweat! With Lucy I have gained confidence not only in my physical abilities by emotionally.

(In fact this gym IS his baby as he ventured in the ownership of this gym)\\n\\nThis location initially opened half of the size what it is today (the expanded section opened in winter 2015/16). It\\'s basically a gym, but has all the standard amenities such as shower room (which was expanded like the other member mentioned) with towels, lockers. As the brand suggests, it opens 24/7, located at the growing neighbourhood of False Creek/Olympic Village, one really no excuses for exercise commitment, especially for those putting \"exercise/fitness\" on their checklist for new years resolution. Once one became a member after 3 months, the security fob opens up access to other Anytime Fitness clubs all over the world.\\n\\nThe team, especially Greg, mentioned above, worked extremely hard to make sure this gym is well-maintained, even during off hours. I\\'m pretty sure all gym owners started this way, but this is based on my 3-year long observation. In the early days he even shows up at midnight to check everything is fine. At one instance I texted him at off hours late at night to report what I thought might be weird activities at the gym, he responds and even shows up at the gym right away.\\n\\nTherefore when it comes to other yelp member\\'s review plus the term \"booby trap\", the owner I know of is not the one the other member claimed. Lots of time it all comes down to \"common sense\", not \"assumption\".  As customers, we probably will go through one or two negative encounters, but it only takes few seconds to put personal emotion aside and try to understand why such encounter occurs. I personally used to work in customer service, I\\'m aware that while business owners and staff strives to go for that extra mile, at times not all customers won\\'t be pleased for various reasons. It\\'s even extremely frustrating from criticism based on incidents that can be avoided with common sense being applied at the first place.\\n\\nLeft this gym in after Christmas 2016 due to personal commitment. Quite frankly I felt bad for leaving this club for Equinox. For the past 3 years coming to this club has been part of my daily routine, and if one is committed to fitness, or even a simple exercise, one can call this place second home. Fitness industry is still in a robust growth mode in Vancouver, especially in Downtown/Yaletown/False Creek and surrounding neighbourhood. Equinox charges high premium, Anytime Fitness charges far less for basics, if you\\'re unable to justify the high premium cost, then Anytime Fitness False Creek no doubt should one\\'s top choice for personal well being.',\n",

One feature is door alarms.\\n \\nOne day after working out I forgot by pilates band in the gym. The next day I went back and saw it sitting on a desk behind a glass door where a staff member had put it for safe keeping. I assumed the door was locked and left. I came back on Saturday looking for staff so I could retrieve my stuff, but nobody was around. Because I knew my band was behind the glass door I opened it. The door was not locked, so I thought, hmmm I will go in and pick up my belongings. An alarm sounded and then I knew I was in trouble, but nothing I could do to reverse the alarm at this point. I felt awful. \\n\\nGreg the owner showed up shortly after that. I tried to apologize but was berated and chastised. No amount of \"sorrys\" could please this guy. There was absolutely no need to lash out to that extend, I could not undue the alarm or time travel into the past and I felt bad enough already. I wondered why the door wasn\\'t locked if it was alarmed? Greg yelled at me and said it was unlocked for a reason and he equated my opening the door to break and entering to someone\\'s personal residence and that I had very poor judgement. \\nSo beware, there are booby traps around the gym, some doors you can open, some you can\\'t. There are no locks or signs and if you can\\'t figure it out you will be treated like a criminal! \\n\\nI only recommend this gym if you make use of the facility during off hours and have no contact at all with the owner. He starts out very nice when selling a membership, but then you need to grow a thick skin to sustain personal attacks when things do go his way.  I don\\'t think this gym can possibly remain in business long if he remains in charge, so make sure you pay month to month so you can get out when you want.\\n\\nI immediately cancelled my membership only to discover many better in gyms in Vancouver for the money where there is more professional management and I am treated like a valued customer.',\n",

The photo that is posted basically show you the whole space - there are no other rooms.  The space is small, but used wisely.  The 7 brand spanking new power racks that line the sides of the room are consistent with the owner Martina's mantra - strong is the new skinny.   I couldn't agree more.\\n\\nWhile I don't participate in the group workouts themselves, I see them posted around the gym, and as a person who used to Crossfit, I can tell you that they are no joke.  If you are interested in those kind of workouts, they will have them here for you.  I've also seen Martina conduct personal training sessions and she's great with her clients - adjusting the plan according to the person.\\n\\nThere are no treadmills, but who needs a treadmill when you can run outside?  Indoors, there are 8 or so brand new spinning machines if you prefer to stay inside.  No concept 2 rower though.  There are some things I'd like to see - i.e. weighted vest, glute-ham machine, seated row machine, corebar, but I'm just being picky ... in light of the best part ... Drop in is $5. Repeat Drop in to use the facility is $5!!!  The rest of the prices are transparent and on the website (unlike most places).  No memberships are required, and if you got a membership there are no initiation fees. No initiation fees. No contract. Not too many places you can find that. \\n\\nThey have water, towels, and if you are the only one working out, you can put your ipod into the speaker system and blast your tunes.  Awesome.\\n\\nNow for the second best part.  Hours are flexible. Sometimes you might drive by and see that it appears closed.  All you have to do is to give Martina a call, and she will open up the gym for you no problem.  \\n\\nYou might find better (I'll review Studeo 55 soon), but you'll have to pay a lot more for it.

       "  'review_text': \"This is a high end gym located on Pacific in the Vancouver House complex near the Granville St bridge. I had a free trial pass, but was always curious about it. The gym is a bit unique in that apparently it's all fitness classes rather than a gym with equipment that is self serve plus classes.\\n\\nI tried the pilates class, which simulated using the reformer, without actually using a reformer. It would have been cooler had they actually done this class with the reformer equipment. Nonetheless, the teacher was very friendly and approachable, with some interesting moves I had not seen elsewhere. All equipment was provided, which was convenient. The studio, however, was smaller than average so people had to be spaced a bit close. Comparatively, the boxing class, has a much larger studio, at least double the size. The aesthetic at this gym is sci-fi, very cavernous, like a cross between a bat cave and star trek. It does not seem like an efficient use of space and they could have used that square footage of the lobby area for bigger fitness studio or a bigger bank of lockers. The bathrooms have lots of showers and free amenities like shampoo and body wash. The showers have a good draining design that seems to prevent a gross accumulation of hair. However, I would rate the amenities as slightly above average as I would have liked to have seen more. Service was good but not above and beyond. I will say that they do not harass you about joining, which is nice.\\n\\nMy overall expectations for this gym were high because of the cost of membership and drop in classes. For the price point, I think there are bigger and better options downtown. This gym is competing in a premium class and I think they need to step it up because their number one rival offers significantly more amenities, bigger facilities, and more fitness class options for the same or possibly even cheaper. On the plus side, a gym is needed in this neighbourhood.\",\n",

Do you really want to sign up at a gym that handles cancellations like this? And no they can\\'t use COVID as an excuse because all of emails up to email #4 and all calls I made were when they are open.\\n\\nMy credit card was compromised in November and I never provided Golds Gym with a new credit card because I had been trying to cancel for a while by that point and they weren\\'t entitled to member dues from me because of my efforts to cancel. What did they do? They sent me to collections because they are still billing me into January! And now if I don\\'t pay these fees that they aren\\'t even entitled to it\\'s going to go on my credit bureau. RIDICULOUS! THIS IS THEFT! \\n\\nSo now I\\'m going to be faced to pay these fees even though I have made ample effort to resolve this matter and cancel my account. \\n\\nUnfortunately I live in a different city now and was not able to come in person when they were open. My advice if you are dealing with this is to send a certified letter in mail, which I will be doing today. I\\'m also writing reviews everywhere online to warn everyone and also filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Failing all that, if they don\\'t return all my gym fees that I\\'m being wrongfully forced to pay luckily I know how to file a claim and affidavits in Small Claims court for damages. It\\'s a massive waste of time and expense just to protect my credit score. \\n\\nGolds Gym West Broadway has the worst business ethics. I moved away from Vancouver but may move back one day. I would have gone to this gym for the free parking but I would never in a million years ever sign a contact with this company ever again!\\n\\n*I will update this review to advise of how this matter progresses',\n",

       "  'review_text': 'In 2016 Gold\\'s Gym new location in Port Coquitlam was opening. My friend and I went to check it out. We asked if they would have tanning beds and the \"liar\" told us, \"yes.\" So, we signed up 2016 09 14! Are there tanning beds yet? I sent an e-mail on Sept 17th 2018 and advised them not to renew my membership. I received an email that my membership has been canceled.  On Dec. 07th 2020 I received a letter from a collection company stating I owed $296.40 (no other emails or letters or phone calls in 2 years) I immediately contacted Gold\\'s Gym and the lady I spoke with said I had an outstanding balance of $150.00. WHAT? I then contacted the collection company and they put a ticket of stay on the account and advised me to NOT contact the gym again. It was close to Christmas and COVID and no one returned my constant calling. I was monitoring my credit and there it was. I contacted TransUnion, Equifax, Experian, Better Business Bureau and Consumer Protection. Due to COVID I was getting nowhere. I refused to pay it to the collection company so there it sits. On Monday 2023 10 11 at 9:43 pm I get an email that from Gold\\'s Gym that I owe $296.40 and to respond within 24 hours or it will go to collections. WHAT? I called the gym  (number provided by them 778-285-4653). What a joke! The girl I spoke with told me they do not have access to the billing departments phone number and we cannot provide you with a phone number to contact anyone. You can send an email. I was ANGRY!!! I sent 2 emails and wouldn\\'t you know it.....no response. Now I am fueled with spite, anger and determination to have this company investigated for FRAUD! This time I will NOT give up.

       "  'review_text': 'I was a member at Golds gym on West Broadway. Untill I was unfairly kicked out. On Friday March 5th,2021. I attended the 10am workout time. During my visit I was approached by another member about my mask/ face shield. While I was working out my face shield slipped up over my head while I was laying down on the mat doing exercises. The strap around my head pressed against the mat and the shield went up over my head.  When this happened , I safely put down my weights and put the shield back in place completely covering my face. Despite being distanced 6 meters apart from other members, one  member that was doing exercises next to me 6 meters apart , came up to me, in my space and made a point to tell me that I should make sure that my mask was to be covering my face at all times. I explained that I was working out and my mask had slipped up. I had also mentioned that if they were offended that they could stay at least 3 meters away and also not to be alarmed that I am not ill and if I was I wouldn\\'t be at the gym or even allowed in the gym. We all get asked the questions about if were well enough to attend and also get our temperature checked at the door before entering. This person did not like my reply and went to speak with Noz, the general manager. At that time Noz came over and right off the bat she told me that she has the power to revoke my membership.  \"Why, I said and for for what reason? I am not doing anything wrong. I am working out here down on my mat minding my own business\". She said I know, I think maybe it\\'s how you spoke to this other member. I said, how ? By telling him he can stay 3 meters apart if there\\'s such an issue. Obviously I wouldn\\'t be here if I was unwell. She again she said I know, just be respectful.  Yes of course I replied.\\nAt the end of the workout session my boyfriend came to collect me and I told him what happened. He approached the member who told on me and asked him why he did that. The other member said that he went to an authority to deal with it. And again we both asked him why. My boyfriend said to the guy, \"hey man if you are unhappy with your life, you don\\'t have to take it out on other people\". And the guy walked away. We were going to talk to Noz right after that but decided to leave it alone.\\n\\nThen all of a sudden Noz emailed myself and my boyfriend at 2:30 the same day saying that our memberships are being revoked. She never even gave me or my boyfriend a chance to explain or defend ourselves or have a mediation between us and the other member. I feel it is very unfair and a violation of my human rights and also I didn\\'t violate any gym regulations or disrespect anybody or even have had any problems before this. I\\'ve emailed 4 different people in authority at gold\\'s and no reply at all. I feel very disrespected! I have always been a good respectful member and it\\'s clear that Golds gym doesn\\'t care about their members. Just their money. Watch out!!',\n",

There\\'s an area set up with a sled/prowler. Most of the machines are plate loaded, and they have a hip thrust machine, which is nice. Other than that, nothing particularly interesting about the machines that you won\\'t find at another gym. If you want to do barbell hip thrusts, however, the only place you can set them up is at the opposite side of the gym from all the plates, which means hauling them from one side of the gym to the other.\\n\\nChildminding: The hours work for me, kid seems to come out with the same number of appendages he went in with.\\n\\nWomen\\'s Only Section: No squat rack, no bench, no barbell. There are two regular benches (but not enough space if two people are using them at a time), a smith and a cable stack. It feels that, rather than someone saying \"ok, we\\'ll have a separate workout area so women can avoid creepers and still go about their regular exercise routine\", they had some guys go, \"oh, crap, we need a special lady area for special lady exercises - they seem to like that thigh spreader machine so I guess we\\'ll put in one of those and a stair master.\" \\n\\nI haven\\'t been there during heavy traffic periods, but I suspect it\\'s grim given how close together everything is.\\n\\nThe biggest downside is they don\\'t have regular foam rollers. Instead they bought thick blue pool noodles, which squish down. So if you roll out before heavy days, you\\'ll need to bring your own roller.\\n\\nThere are a couple of personal trainers floating around, but I haven\\'t really seen them with clients so no opinion on them.

       "  'review_text': 'I was a member of Studeo for about a year and a half between 2008-2009.  Since then I dropped in on occassion to workout.  As of this month they have opened up a new space at 865 Hornby at the space once occupied by the Pantheon Athletic Club.  They were formerly at 1114 Alberni, but you\\'ll see now that that entire lot is being torn down (likely for office or condo building I bet).\\n\\nBut if you ever visited the old Pantheon Athletic Club, don\\'t for one second think it looks like that.  Totally different, and completely renovated. And clean.  It looks like a swank hotel lounge.  You have all the amenities, towel service, water bottles, clean private showers.  Easily the prettiest gym you\\'ll ever visit.  More importantly there is a tight community there.  People know your name, and are very friendly.  At the same time, no one is trying to sell you extra services (some gyms trainers will talk to you to try to get you to train with them, but there is no such pressure here).  It can be a huge motivator to have people around you with similar fitness goals.\\n\\nOf course you get what you pay for.  With the new space, I believe memberships went up, and sit at $160 a month for unlimited classes.  This sounds like a lot, but if you did Crossfit for example, you\\'d find that prices at other Crossfit \"boxes\" to be similar, and unlike those boxes, Studeo operates under normal gym hours (at the boxes, you come in only when there are classes scheduled), and doesn\\'t look or smell like a warehouse.  As for the other classes, with the exception of Urban Detox (their signature circuit class on Saturdays), you will always get a ton of personal attention because they are so small.  For example, you\\'ll often find yourself in a Yoga class with an instructor and maybe 2 other members.  Anyway, if you go enough as a member, it could be worth your while.  I aimed for 15-20 times a month, so it was basically less than $10 a visit.  \\n\\nI couldn\\'t give Studeo five stars for a few reasons.  First, I can\\'t afford it right now.  If you can, go for it.  Second, while they have done great things with their current space, their old space was amazing - it felt more like a jungle gym play space and most notably had natural lighting coming in from the windows - the new club does not have natural lighting and feels closer to a conventional fitness club (though still in many ways unique).  Third, they are closed on Sundays, a change that took place I believe in 2009. That is at least 4 fewer days open a month than most places.  Fourth, the parking situtaion was better in the old space - if you came at the right times, parking could be free (though technically it should not have been). Nowadays I think it will be $6 or so for valet at their building lot, and a little less if you park it yourself.  On top of that, someone has to walk you back down to get your back into their parking lot, which seems terribly inconvenient.  As a result, people are just looking for parking elsewhere and walking over. Finally,  the club has frequent turnover of trainers.  The entire roster save for one trainer (excluding the owner and manager) have left since I started including the trainers I credit most with my progress, Darren Beattie for strength training (see his blog: http://artofweightlossblog.com/) and Jason Van Montfoort for nutrition.\\n \\nSo if you have money, live or work downtwn (so parking doesn\\'t matter), plan to come often (other than on Sundays) and appreciate working out with a community that would certainly motivate you, this is the place for you.  I encourage you to at least see the place for yourself.',\n",

In other gyms only Crossfit will cost more than at studeo 55 membership. They also have awesome chiropractor, nutritionist, physiotherapist and registered massage therapist.  The concept of the gym is being healthy as whole and get the best of ourselves, not someones body. Since I am there, around 5 month I have learned a lot.\\nThe atmosphere there is amazing and everyone knows you by your name and they truly care about us (at least thats how I feel ). My back was pretty bad and my self steam was even lower, they helped me with that too. Personal trainer was amazing, I only bought a couple sessions and there is no pressure on that, I am going to start my on ramp this week for Crossfit and I cant wait. Ok so some important points: They do charge a small initiation fee but they give you assessments with all crew and its definitely worst the money. Membership depends if you want personal training or not, treatments and all. Parking is free when you are doing treatments or personal training. If you do personal training 3 times per week you dont pay membership. The price of PT is same as other gyms I have been so its an awesome deal, trust me.\\nFinally, they have a cool place to make shakes for you and a bunch of classes.

       "  'review_text': \"I am a local Fireman and competitive athlete and spend on average 5 or more days a week in the gym. For me, finding an environment that I am comfortable working out in that I enjoy spending my time at is a must. Over the years I have tried everything from cheaper priced community centers to common branded gyms such as Fitness World as well as high-end outfits such as  Studeo 55, where I have been working out at for the past 2 years. And I can definitely assure you that Studeo 55 is an experience not to be missed and I feel that the least I can do is share my positive experience at Studeo 55 on here with you.\\n\\n  The biggest problems I have found attending gyms over the years are that knowledgeable staff were in short supply or not even available, equipment at the gyms were very limiting to the exercises you were able to preform (such as not having proper olympic weights for lifts, not enough free weights, or only one squat rack, etc), classes offered by the gyms were very generic and limited, and that the atmosphere of the gyms were very impersonal and that I was just another number.  \\n\\n  \\nI can assure you that at Studeo 55 this is not the case. Of course the membership at Studeo 55 is a more expensive than some of the other gyms I have tried, but you are definitely getting your money's worth and the facility shines in comparison to any other gym I have attended. \\n  \\n  For starters, the first thing you will notice is the reception you receive from Chad and the staff at the front desk when you walk through the doors. Always friendly and always helpful, I frequently find myself talking about my weekend with Chad at the front desk. My experiences with Nathan (owner and trainer), as well as some of the other trainers I have worked with such as Jeremy, and Jason have all been positive and have left me coming out of my sessions with a better understanding of training and more effective ways to reach the goals I desired. That's not to say that there are not trainers who are less experienced, which there are. But even they have proved to be very helpful and if  they were ever unsure about something, they always found someone who was able to answer my questions. At Studeo you will find a large array of areas to work out. There are 6 large open rooms from two weight rooms with free weights, squat racks and machines, two martial arts rooms which include heavy bags and speed bags, a yoga studeo, a dance studeo, and even including a Cross-Fit room (where yes, they have olympic weights you can drop to prevent injury, and all the other basic crossfit gear from med balls to kettle bells). The classes at studeo are varied and always changing assuring you to keep from getting bored. If your looking for a hardcore workout there is the crossfit classes, or if your just looking to do a quick but still  challenging workout there's classes like tabata time and urban detox.\\n  \\nOverall the biggest thing I have come to appreciate (outside of the great facility), is the staff. That is what truly sets this gym apart from others. So if you are looking for a warm fun atmosphere to work out in with great knowledgeable staff, look no further.\",\n",

Over the years I worked out at all types of places. Fancy places, crossfit gyms, family clubs and so on. The weights got boring. It was hard to find a trainer who would push me - but not kill me. Studeo is by far the best place I've ever worked out at. When I joined I was in the worst shape of my life and I had an injury. The RMT and the health team worked together to help me get in shape, lose some weight and rehab my injured hip. The facility is great. Very different than any place I've been to before. The people there make this place great. They get to know you. I enjoy being there. I workout because it helps me be both physically and mentally healthy. The better I feel, the more confident I feel and that helps me be better at work too. I'm very happy with Studeo Gyms. Now all I need to do is to cut out drinking beer and I'll be ripped. : )\",\n",

I realized that the gym I \"belonged\" to was impersonal; so I cancelled the gym membership and joined Studeo 55.  My journey started in December 2010 and since this time I have had a wonderful trainer/mentor who has taught me the key elements of getting fit and strong; not only physically but mentally.  My weight loss has been consistent and this is because the trainer at Studeo 55 took the time to share what he is passionate about and gave me the tools to use to stay focused and committed.  There is a real sense of community at Studeo 55 not only with the staff team but your team mates.  I walk out of there feeling encouraged each and every time.  All the trainers are passionate about what they do and this shows in the variety of classes and training sessions (Crossfit, MMA, Yoga, Group Classes and much more).   There are many different rooms to use and the space is aesthetically pleasing.  I think if you are reading this review that you should come and check it out for yourself.

The current owner has done a lot to upgrade the facility, and it shows. The upgraded lighting and ventilation systems have really improved the gym without compromising the character. Fresh paint and new equipment have made the space even better. The upgrades to the women's change room were long overdue. Thanks for that, Roy!\\n\\nI've been here every day of the week from early mornings, to mid-day to late evenings.

Under the old owners, staff were all friendly and pleasant. Paper towels were always stocked and employees were frequently seen cleaning equipment. That's not the case anymore. I don't particularly care if someone greets me when I walk through the door, but when 2/3 of the paper towels are empty and employees are sitting behind the desk eating or chatting with friends, it doesn't project a professional image. This is the main reason for my 4-star rating.\\n\\nSpartacus attracts a diverse clientele and seems LGBT-friendly, which is a plus in East Van. There's definitely no need to feel self-conscious here.

       "  'review_text': \"Spartacus Gym is Vancouver's best kept secret, especially considering that the city's as health-conscious, gym/yoga-obsessed as they get.\\n\\nBut here's this old little gym tucked away underneath Caffé Roma on Commercial Drive, charging less than $40 per month (which includes access to almost all their classes: yoga, spin, pilates, zumba, etc.)... but the place is absolutely unpretentious and all-inclusive, plus the staff are amazing. Roy and Nelson, in particular, are inspirational - if you get a chance to take a class or training session with them, do so!\\n\\nWhile not the fanciest gym in terms of infrastructure, all the equipment is in excellent shape, and there's obviously a lot of love that goes into running the place. They'd probably hate me for saying this, but Spartacus reminds me a little of my high school gym; something I find completely endearing. There are several TVs and the music's often a good mix (ie: Thievery Corporation, Metric, Depeche Mode, etc.). As for the equipment, they have pretty much everything you'd need: free weights, weight machines, elliptical machines, bikes, etc. plus one classroom not unlike a dance studio.\\n\\nBut what I really love about this gym is that it's home to a diverse community; many people who live on Commercial Drive come here and have been coming here for ages. But people of all ages, all races, all genders, all shapes - everyone is welcome. And when you're a tad self-conscious, or you're not a gym regular, or even if you're a fitness guru - coming here, you'll feel welcomed, and I love it for that.\",\n",

The only thing you can do here is get fit. There is no steam room to go hide in, no tea lounge... just a big room full of fitness equipment. What they do offer, which makes it more than just a small neighborhood gym, is classes. Right in the middle of this big room full of sweaty, grunting weight-lifters is an enclosed studio space. They offer yoga, spinning, aerobics, Zumba.. you name it. And it's all included in the membership! THAT is what keeps me coming back here. \\nAt a lot of gyms you pay more to get the spa treatment.

At first the staff said that other than during busy hours (noontime and after 5pm), there isn't a wait to get into the gym and the floor is not usually at full capacity. But I go at off-peak hours (weekdays at 2pm or 3pm) and still have to wait 15 min to an hour at times. Although before, I'd only be able to work out at the gym for only an hour when the bookings were in place initially when gyms reopened after covid lockdown, at least I'd be able to plan to be in and out of the gym in an hour. Now, I have to put aside 2+ hours for a gym session in case there is a long line at the gym to get in.\\n\\nAlso, it's difficult to find a clean locker by the time I actually get into the gym. Clearly the staff are not regularly cleaning the lockers and changing room areas. It was definitely better when there was a booking system in place and the staff were clearly expected to clean the entire facility between each one hour time slot.\\n\\nI feel like GoodLife at hemlock got rid of the booking system despite covid still going on just to save costs of having their staff clean the facility more regularly and also to try to recruit more members but not actually having the capacity for all of them. \\n\\nWhen complaining to staff about my concerns, I was directed to contact GoodLife via their general business email but after trying to email them, I get an automatically generated response saying the email address is not even monitored. \\n\\nI appreciate this location being a female only location and the equipment being fairly new.

       "  'review_text': 'I have been an extremely loyal member of this gym since 2016. This gym did well to navigate the changes and restrictions due to Covid. I can only speak for the 6am weekday timeslot - they have lost a significant number of members who are waiting for instructor-led classes to return before unfreezing their membership. However management are waiting for members to return before bringing a full schedule of instructor-led classes back. And by waiting, they are alienating the few that are still trying to come in at 6am - even for a virtual class. Members do not want virtual classes anymore (at home or in the gym)!\\nOn top of this, they are now experimenting with introducing Team Training - which doesn\\'t appear to be of interest specifically for 6am (and would be an additional cost!).\\nIn my opinion - their instructors are world-class - and are being underutilized. One would expect for an organization to attempt to keep their instructors certified and busy after the constant lay-offs due to the shut down of gyms.\\nChange management and communication around all these changes has been poor. I understand they are experimenting with various options , and that not everyone is going to be happy. It is just sad that management do not seem to understand the unique circumstances of the 6am clients. This gym just makes me feel sad.\\nI have since joined a different gym -and I can honestly say it was a \"push\" not a \"pull\".',\n",

       "  'review_text': \"I am a Corporate member at the Vancouver Hemlock and 8th for Women club. I am beyond frustrated with the staff at the club for being so incredibly unprofessional and avoidant with my concerns and complaints. I understand that the club has recently opened and therefore not all protocols are in place. However the information they give are inconsistent and their lack of care is what is frustrating. First and foremost, when the club just opened, I told the staff that my sister is also a member and there was something wrong with her account. For some reason it does not show up when we scan her in. Marielle, the Member Representative, kept insisting that my sister was not a member, to which I told her we're getting charged for both memberships and therefore she has to be a member. It took the staff 3-4 visits to figure out that the problem is with the malfunctioning keychain that they activated her account with. They were slow to respond and even doubted us.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe second incident was today when I brought my younger cousin in for a free trial. I called beforehand and Zoey, another Member Representative, answered. I knew that because my cousin is underage she would need a parent or guardian to accompany her. I mentioned that my cousin is not from Vancouver and that she's visiting for a few days. She has plans to move here for school and wants to try out the club. Her mom lives in Aldergrove and is unable to accompany her. I asked if my father who is her guardian is allowed to sign off for her, which Zoey rejects as a possible solution. She suggests I email a note with my cousin's mother's approval and signature as an alternative. I do exactly as she asks and she books us in at 1315 for my cousin's orientation. She fails to mention this piece of incredibly pertinent information that it would need to be approved by Head Quarters and may take a few days up to a few weeks. I mentioned to her that my cousin is only staying for a couple days. Once I arrive at the club, I was informed that she was on a break and would not meet me. After waiting 10 minutes, Marielle greeted me and told me that my cousin's pass may not be approved for a while. I asked why Zoey did not greet me when I booked an orientation with her and was ignored. I decided to speak to the General Manger, Talia. Instead of allowing me to explain my frustration, she talked the entire time and proceeded to make excuses for her staff. I told her this is not the first time important information has not been relayed to me, and how the information is inconsistent depending on who I talk to. She was condescending and avoidant of my concerns throughout the entire 3 minutes that she spared me. She even told me to be more considerate. They did not offer any solutions, they just told me to call Head Office and to deal with it myself. Hemlock is the only women's gym in Vancouver and I am abhorred with how everything has been handled. No feasible solutions were offered for other times I brought up small complaints, rather they would tell me to accept things for how they are until they figure it out. I am beyond appalled in the lack of respect and poor customer service that the staff has given me.\",\n",

I've never been much of a group fitness person, but after hearing about the rave reviews of Body Pump I gave it a shot...and loved it. Definitely worth checking out! \\n\\nThe staff are really friendly here, and always go above and beyond to help you out. There always is lots of equipment available even during peak hours, but I do wish they had more space for stretching. The group fitness room is often in use with a class, and there really isn't any empty space to throw a mat down and stretch without feeling like you're in everyone's way. \\n\\nIf anyone at Goodlife is reading this, I'd also like to see magazine holders available since some of the cardio equipment doesn't have a shelf to prop anything up. The bikes in particular! My old gym (VI Fitness) had acrylic plastic S-shaped racks that fit over the controls. Also, equipment with built-in TV's would be awesome, as I hear several other Goodlife locations in Vancouver have them! \\n\\nThe place is very clean, and there are big windows to keep you distracted without feeling like anyone's checking you out. The gym's above the street so people walking by can't see you, as far as I can tell.\\n\\nParking is a bonus, since this area of Vancouver is nearly ALL pay parking. It's nice to have several reserved Goodlife stalls in the lot. More spaces would be nice, but if they're full you can usually wait 10 minutes and one will free up. \\n\\nOverall - Yes, I highly recommend this Goodlife location. Check it out!\",\n",

For me my areas of importance are the weight training selection and how busy it's going to be. I don't want to spend my precious gym time waiting for each and every machine. This gym is not big by any means, but it is very well equipped. As I understand it they just did some renovations. The classes look like they get really busy, but I'm not really a class person. There is a decent variety and amount of cardio equipment as well. Their basic membership will run you just over 40 with tax and the prestige (with tanning/all classes) just over 60. This also provides access to all BC clubs. At first I was like I don't need that, but got the higher membership for the tanning.\\nWell jokes on me as I got sent to Victoria for work on day 2 of my membership. So guess who got a workout in at GoodLife in Victoria. The staff is really friendly. What I like is they are very transparent. I belonged to them in Ontario and was always very happy. I was sad when moving to Van to see they didn't have as much of a presence here- ultimately that's how I ended up at the Y initially due to wanting to be in walking distance.

       "  'review_text': 'I signed up with GoodLife over three months ago hoping to get back into shape. When I went there for the first time I wanted a drop in fee just to check it out. It was 15 dollars. So they said if I was coming there every week it would only be 12 dollars a week. So I said okay, but the sign up process took so long that I wasn\\'t able to work out because I had to go to class. From then on the gym was excellent. Good equipment. But when I was at school someone told me that they signed up with the same gym for only 2.99 a week. What the hell? How did the person that signed me up never tell me that option. I have the full classes and tanning which I don\\'t need because the classes are always full. ALWAYS FULL. It\\'s so frustrating. If I wasn\\'t scammed into such an expensive price for a student I would recommend it. Today was the last straw for me this was my third time walking in hoping to join a class only to realize it was full. So instead of working in the weight room I was so upset, angry and frustrated that I just went home.  When I complained they said \"We have another class tomorrow at 10:30 or you have to be here 20 minutes earlier next time\". I\\'m a full time student with a part- time job. I can\\'t come earlier or go to any other class. When I signed up I wanted to set a goal to feel better about myself and going confidence, it hurts most that i\\'ll never achieve it.',\n",

People who go there for weightlifting are avid fans, and with their own platforms and the ability to drop weights, I can see why they love it so much. The music is good too, and the community is somewhat friendly. They also allow dogs in the facility, which is awesome. Its location is convenient for lots of people- it's in between downtown and kits. For those reasons, I can comfortably give Dynasty 4 stars as a general gym. \\n\\nThat being said, the crossfit at Dynasty is somewhat mediocre. The programming isn't detailed, and the warm ups are very general- if you have mobility issues, you'd better warm up by yourself beforehand or maybe not go to that gym for a class. It's a general warm up and then you go straight to the strength movement.They also don't have anything to digitally keep track of member scores so you can't compete against your community or even yourself, with old scores. The space and equipment is also super limited. When you use a barbell, you're likely sharing it with 1-3 other people, even though the class cap is 16. They don't really have the equipment that I think one needs to keep crossfit well rounded like numerous GHDs, assault bikes, lots of squat racks, rogue-style boxes, true form runners, ski ergs etc. When I went, it felt less competitive than my current box, and most people looked to be crossfit beginners- and there's nothing wrong with that, but I personally feel that it's better to workout with people who are skilled at crossfit, as they inspire you to push yourself. In my view, this is not a crossfit gym, this is a weightlifting gym. And while there are great things about it, like good ownership, location and barbells, it's not a place I would recommend strongly for crossfit.\",\n",
