0,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"This place has really really beautiful scenery and sunset. It is 30 min drive away from downtown Vancouver, super convenient 

Now let's talk about the slopes, most runs are super bumpy with lots of moguls. Not the best for snowboarding, only 2-3 runs have smooth packed runs that you can go fast. Great place for beginners or skiers.",2023-03-16T04:34:46Z,103
1,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"This is my favourite local mountain. It's kind of your no frills place for winter activities from tubing, cross country skiing, and downhill ski and snowboard activities.

There's a nice cafe and shop where you can buy or rent your gear and even get some waxing or maintenance done for your equipment.

Be sure to buy your tickets online for easy check in if you already have a pass card. Or you can retrieve it from one of the automated kiosks with your purchase QR code. Lifts are plentiful and fast and great for beginners or experts alike.",2023-01-24T21:08:21Z,103
2,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"I found Cypress quite nice maybe it's because it's above the cloud and the conditions are just better.  It is not accessible by bus, your option is parking or the shuttle ($35 round trip) or what I did was carpool in the area ($20).

The location has night skiing so it's pretty nice if you're not an early riser, on two of my days the Sky lift was closed and on the final day it was open on my 3 day pass visit.

The conditions have a lot of character some more friendly for snowboarding and some more friendly for skiing.  The moguls are nice to tackle when new powder is down, there are snow machines.  I really enjoyed the conditions it was a mini version of a mountain that still left me aching from all the carving and it had beautiful sunset views, just visit my Instagram for a shot of that.

The washrooms on the lower floor next to the Starbucks has hand dryers.  Hot chocolate will cost you $5 and beer will cost you $6-7.50 with additional liquor tax.

I found this place crowded ; you can bypass the line with the ""single"" entrance.

Check out my insta for a snapshot from Raven with the Olympic Rings in the background.",2023-01-11T06:34:26Z,103
3,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"LPT: Take the lesson! Great place and everyone working was genuinely kind. An assortment of people from all over. 

I unfortunately didn't know what I was doing and had a scary first time! But I can see the joy others had!",2023-05-07T19:41:57Z,103
4,Cypress Mountain,3.7,Very beautiful and accessible ski resort near Vancouver. You can see the whole city when you get tot the top. The only thing was that the ski lanes were way too short. It took 10 mins to get up but 30 seconds to get down. I will still consider coming for its convenience of the location,2023-01-02T05:30:48Z,103
5,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Info on cafeteria as Crazy Raven Grill was closed that day.  There is a grab and go section of sandwiches, wraps, salads and desserts. See photo on pricing and selection. Overall food was hot and dining area is well maintained. Please do limit yourself as there are signs posted for 30 minutes of dining as seats are limited.  Another positive since covid is there is a hand washing station on the 2nd floor.",2022-01-25T21:39:28Z,103
6,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Got there at 8:30am and getting our rentals and rfid was a quick process! The mountain was relatively empty from 9-1ish, which was nice and staff were on top of making sure everyone was wearing a mask! 

At one point I was going down and kept falling and my knee was hurting and I realized that my binding had shifted so that my left foot was facing inwards, which was a big problem. I was still halfway up so I had no choice but snowboard down in absolute pain because of the shift. I took the board to the rental area and the guy was flabbergasted at how that happened, considering the binding was on the board really tight. He got me new binding and put it on properly but the damage was done, my knee was in so much pain that I only did one more small run and had to call it. I spent most of the afternoon sitting around (I wanted my friends to make the most of the trip so I waited) 

Overall great experience, though it did get very busy around 4:30-5pm and no one was social distancing. 
I regret paying almost $200 considering the flaw in the snowboard binding that I was given by the resort which resulted in me being unable to snowboard the whole day so I spent $$ for half a day  

The views from up there are incredible, and I would likely go again but not during a time when they double their ticket prices, cause it's really not worth it :/ 

The actual runs themselves were great and challenging for a beginner at least, and I appreciated the importance they put on masks so I would recommend this place to others!",2020-12-29T23:09:53Z,103
7,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"I just spent 30 minutes of frustration on the cypress mountain website. 
Someone needs to test it, as it is not only poorly designed but does not even do the simplest functions. Definitely not overloaded with traffic as late at night, end of season. 
 
I asked for a password reset to my email six times, waited 2 hours and nothing ever came.It said ""success"" each time, which implies it had my correct email address. 
 
Then I used a different email to create a new account. I created the group members/bdates, made my ski lift order, click the shopping cart , read and initial the waivers, then the Continue button goes dark and the page freezes. This happened 5 times. 
 
Honestly, someone needs to look into this. Pretty basic stuff. 
 
The short season of Cypress/Grouse/Seymour mountains needs all the help it can get. Many years ago, I saw Grouse mountain go bankrupt several times before they developed their summertime gondola business. 
 
This complaint will also go on YELP, in hopes someone will wake up over there. 
Good luck. Great mountain/facilities... really lousy website.",2023-03-28T03:21:04Z,103
8,Cypress Mountain,3.7,Loved Cypress Mountain. We went for the snow tubing and it didn't disappoint. We went during the week on a Wednesday. Not a lot of people. The staff that worked that day was AMAZING!!!! They were all so kind and very helpful. My kids loved going down all three hills. You can tell when people enjoy going to work. They all had amazing attitudes.,2023-02-11T04:41:16Z,103
9,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Small but super cool ski resort with amazing views of Lions Bay. 

Spring skiing season. We came here for some quick short turns. The runs are very short but still fun. There's only 4 chair lifts really and one was closed due to coverage issues. 

The mountain is stunningly beautiful and sky chair has the best views. Terrain is ok. High speed quad chairs are nice, RF ID to enter the ski area. 

WiFi is impossible to connect! Bathrooms are not super clean. Parking was pretty easy.",2019-04-02T06:44:10Z,103
10,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Loved my time here! Avoid the crowds of whistler with this awesome alternative. Affordable, great facilities and night time hours provide an amazing experience. Highly recommend it and will totally be back.",2015-02-23T06:29:49Z,103
11,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"I'm not from Vancouver, but I have visited Vancouver practically almost every winter break from middle school until end of high school. Every single time I come to visit, my relatives always bring me here, and I absolutely love it each time! It's practically winter wonderland for me seeing this beautiful place all covered in snow. I remember back in my younger days when I would snow tube down that section of the mountain designated for snowtubing. Coming here was definitely the highlight of my childhood. I haven't gone back since high school, and I can't wait to come back!",2013-06-07T00:05:30Z,103
12,Cypress Mountain,3.7,Don't ever go there when it's busy it's a nightmare. They are completely unprepared for the volume of people. They really should close the park when it's at capacity instead of cramming as many people in as they can . I took my son today to go tubing but gave up because the lines were over an hour long! Have to say the tubing considering the location was a pathetic size. Lambeth Ontario tubing where it's Pretty much flat has way better and larger tubing. All in all very disappointing.,2015-12-29T01:34:50Z,103
13,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"This review is about one of those secret places that makes Vancouver special. It is of course the Hollyburn lodge at Cypress Bowl.  The lodge was built in 1926 in the days prior to the construction of the Cypress Bowl road. You can only imagine the difficulties of trying to get up here in the winter back then. Fortunately it has persevered throughout the years for us to enjoy.

The uneven hand-hewn wood floors, log walls, rustic furniture, and a wood stove surrounded by plenty of pegs to dry off your wet woolens add to the character of the lodge. As for culinary indulgences the menu features one of the most decadent and calorie rich dishes. Basically they are fondue lover enablers. As a child of the 70's I have had my fair share of fondue. As such I highly recommend the cheese, but the chocolate is perfectly nice. What I'm not too sure about is if you should have both in one sitting. Which is what I have done every time I have been to the lodge and always regret. It is just too much food. Plus the cheese and chocolate fusion in my tummy is never pleasant. If you are not going to take my advice, for safety you should bring a minimum of four starving winter athletes to devour it all. They of course have both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. There is also a small menu if you are not into fondue.

Hollyburn lodge is a great place to go with a large group. So consider it if you have a winter birthday or need a great idea for a staff Christmas party. Starting in January on Saturday nights they have a live music so if you are going to book your adventure you might want to consider this. I believe there is a cover charge.

In order to gain access to the lodge you either have to cross country ski in or you can take the guided fondue snowshoe tour. If you are thinking of just showing up I think the staff look at your ski pass to make sure you are eligible to be served.",2013-12-14T19:52:20Z,103
14,Cypress Mountain,3.7,Tube park: Disappointment. Took family tubing since the snow Pack was low and could not ski. Only had three runs in 2 hours. Save your $$. Don't go. They let too many in at one time. Way to much time waiting around.,2014-01-05T22:15:45Z,103
15,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"This rating is for their BEGINNER CLASSES and the ski lift operators. I recently attended one of their beginner classes with a girlfriend and left feeling like it was a huge waste of money. We originally called up requesting a private lesson but the fellow on the phone convinced us to do a group class first as it would work out cheaper. So we showed up and plonked down our money for a beginners class and after a 2 hour circus, felt as though we hadn't really learned anything. And had zero confidence at all. This is my second time snowboarding and my second class, the first one I did was a few years ago in washington state and it was far better by comparison. Not only that but the 'newbie hill' they put us on had no conveyor belt or a pulley system or anything and we just all ended up tiring ourselves out and losing our enthusiasm for learning very quickly. The instructor wrapped up by saying that if we where interested in doing private lessons it was highly recommended and you could learn a lot quicker. Then left behind a group of people who couldn't snowboard at all and wished us the best. 

It felt like a huge waste of time and like we'd just thrown our money away. We ended up trying to brave the ski left ourselves due to the fact that we where tired from having to un-bind and walk ourselves up a 3 meter slope every time. (once again, due to no conveyor belt/pulley system) We told the guy at the start of the lift we where new, and he helped us on and was quite good, but didn't tell us what we had to do coming off the lift. As we approached the end of the lift we started yelling 'hey we're new' but the lift guys had their back turned to us and where having a conversation. Although I made it off okay my partner smashed her face on the ground pretty bad and was almost in tears, and we went home shortly afterwards. To add insult to injury the lift guys gave us attitude saying 'hey, if you'd just told us we could have slowed it down for you' - Idiots. Why do you think we where calling out? Do your f*cking job properly.

Overall the day cost us about $300 which I feel was completely wasted. I think we would have enjoyed the experience a lot more had the instructor gone the extra mile to help us learn, and had more adequate facilities for learning like one of those conveyor belt things.",2011-12-17T20:26:11Z,103
16,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"In my opinion this is the best mountain among the three closest to Vancouver. 2 peaks and a lot of runs to choose from, ranging from bunny hills to double blacks, 47 named runs in total. There is also the Nordic park, a 19 km cross country track, and the snowtubing if you want. Cypress mountain was one of the host for the 2010 Winter Olympics game with all of the freestyle skiing and snowboarding competitions including moguls, aerials, ski cross, half-pipe, snowboard cross and parallel giant slalom held here. What more can you ask for. I absolutely love it.",2011-04-19T19:28:35Z,103
17,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"For a local mountain I don't think Cypress can be beat. The lines are short, the lifts are efficient, the terrain is well taken care of, and the runs are relatively long.  As an intermediate skiier I would choose Cypress over Whistler any day purely because I think it has a great quality vs. proximity to Vancouver ratio (and I just hate long car rides).  I enjoy stopping in at the Crazy Raven Bar for a mid-day whisky cider to warm me up.  Can't comment on the rentals because I bring my own equipment. There are (small) signs warning about equipment theft so you'd better lock up if you're attached to your stuff.",2013-10-02T00:17:22Z,103
18,Cypress Mountain,3.7,Best North Shore mountain.  Our boys 8 & 6 had drop in lessons yesterday.  They both loved it and the instructors were all great. Thanks for the fantastic results.,2011-01-24T19:31:52Z,103
19,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"This review is for the snow tubing and sledding area only. We came here on my sister's last weekend in Vancouver to have some fun with our little cousins and play in the snow.  I've been snowtubing at Mt. Seymour (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/mt-seymour-north-vancouver-2#hrid:wSGV0nrNJ10wDinI23WU6g/src:self) and it was much more thrilling and the view was a lot nicer.  Cypress's snowtube slope wasn't very steep or long. On top of that, they only had 4 lanes going, when I swear Seymour had more. And the pulley wasn't working for part of the time. The younger kids couldn't go snowtubing so they were in the sledding area. It is a smaller hill, but we went down it a few times and it was much more fun and exciting than the snowtubing hills because you go down faster.  Unfortunately, Seymour doesn't have a sledding area for younger kids, which is why we ended up at Cypress. Next time, we'll know.",2012-02-11T08:28:02Z,103
20,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"It was the perfect day for me to visit. Got my board waxed here and did several decent runs. It does get crowded so it may be best to go earlier rather than later.

On your birthday, you get a free day pass. I find that if you are doing easier runs, it is better to go to the longer runs as there are less people and you could properly carve without nearly running people over.

The waxing took less than 20 mins and made carving a lot easier. I'd recommend taking your equipment here for a wax.",2020-02-20T22:43:36Z,103
21,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Cypress Mountain contracts with Cypress Coach Lines for shuttle service from Vancouver up to the resort. The shuttle has been a mess. Not only are there delays, but outright cancellations with no one to notify passengers. I get it. Winter weather, accidents, etc happen. However, let passengers know either through a representative, social media, or by phone. No one picks up at the phone number on the shuttle's site. It's fine if the shuttle to the resort is cancelled, but what happens of the shuttle is cancelled down the mountain? 
Cypress Mountain, you can do better. Pick a more reliable shuttle provide. It is the first and last thing skiers and riders experience with your resort. Don't get stuck with Cypress Coach Lines.",2021-12-22T17:52:37Z,103
22,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"My favorite place to snowboard.

I've been here twice. One to go tubing (which I highly recommend if you don't want to snowboard/ski and have kids). Second time, relearning how to snowboard. Shout out to my super patient and helpful teacher, aka my husband. Once I got the hang of it, I was cruising down the mountain easily. A lot of locals and snowboard instructors that saw my progression actually congratulated me when I was finally able to cruise down without falling! The vibe was awesome, locals were super encouraging, and first shred of the season was magical. Oh, and not to mention that this all happened while it was snowing. 

Being from out of town, the wait to get gear and a lift ticket sucks. We waited over an hour in line just to get gear. However, when you get past all that BS, the ride is amaaaaazing.",2018-12-03T17:49:25Z,103
23,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Cypress Mountian has the worst website and customer support that seems unwilling or unable to do anything if the website does not work.   Below is the response I recieved on the 11th, it is the 14th still not fixed.  Also called on the 9th, they told me they could not do anything.
The mountain is fine and great for local mountain.  The staff on mountain is friendly and competent.  But the IT and customer service is the worst and not sure why they even bother staffing, or perhaps they do not have an IT department at all, as the website has crashes and hang ups every year, something that I come to expect in 2001 not 2021. 
I would recommend showing up in person instead of trying to use the website to do anything with Cypress.

Hi,
Thanks for getting in contact.
We have been experiencing some issues with our website due to the large volume of people trying to access lessons.
We are working hard to solve this issue.
All we can suggest right now it to try the website again to complete your booking.
Please let me know if I can help in any other way.
Best Regards,
Guest Services Team",2021-12-14T16:07:00Z,103
24,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"You come here for skiing or snowboarding that's it.   There's really no other activities at this location.... you need to go down the mountain a couple of miles for sledding.   There isn't even any area you can walk around and explore.

Come BEFORE it opens if you want to start skiing before it's lunch time.
It opens at 9 and we arrived at 830 and it still took about an hour to get the rental gear and tickets picked up.    On a busy day don't even think about coming after 10am.   The line goes all the way out to the parking lot.  I can easily see this being a 2-3 hour ordeal before you start skiing.",2019-01-08T05:35:15Z,103
25,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"I was looking forward to buying discounted family season passes today by the 9/30 deadline, as we just moved here and love your mountain.
However, to be honest it has been extremely frustrating experience today.

I have been trying all day, literally, on multiple web browsers, throughout the day to order 5 passes for myself, my spouse and kids using the family discount. 
Each page takes a really long time to load, often 15 minutes or more.
- Most of the time it is stuck when trying to add a pass to the cart, the cart would not load.
- Only one or two times I managed to add it to the cart, but then I need to add my kids passes.
- One time I got through but need to register accounts for each of us, but that fails.
- Before I could even hit checkout, even with incomplete names, the site timed out and I had to start over.

I'm sorry but I really don't have all day to buy the passes.   Now I'm strongly discouraged.",2020-10-01T04:05:18Z,103
26,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Had an incredible time on the Eagle Coaster. I originally bought 1 ride down the coaster (~$40) during its first week of being open. I ended up behind an elderly couple that was going quite slow. Before it was my turn to go down, we decided to give the elderly couple about 2 minutes before I started my way down, however, I ended up catching up to them about half way through the ride. When I got to the bottom, the gentleman asked how my ride was and could clearly see that I was a bit let down and disappointed. He offered me a second ride (free of charge) to make up for having to slow down. The second ride we decided to wait 3 minutes before the person below me went down so I could ensure that I didn't have to break or slow down during my ride, and it was well worth it! What an adventure and thrill! My recommendation to those that plan on riding the coaster is to keep your hand on the accelerator even though the boards say to break or slow down. You do not need to slow down and you will not fall off the ride!",2021-07-25T23:59:30Z,103
27,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Fantastic spot to get your winter sport craving in!  Whether it's skiing, snowboarding or snowshoeing, this is a great spot. Lots of free parking. On weekend, if you don't arrive by 9:30. You'll be parking in the furthest lot (like we do because we keep sleeping in). I have to say that it's annoying when people pretend that they're dropping off family, or say they are handicap, so they can try to get a spot near the front. What makes you think you're special?

Anyway, I've been here to ski at night. Good deals on lift tickets. Especially when you are comparing it to other mountains so much as Seymour and the now sell an arm and leg Whistler, this is a great local hill. Night skiing is great. Many runs are open and well lit. 

On the weekends, we tend to take my dog to snow shoe up to Bowen Lookout. The trails are easy to follow and well marked with gorgeous views from bottom to top. And it's FREE!! All you need is to ensure you have the disclaimer ticket displayed prominently, which you can grab at the hikers chalet (not the main one. This is the smaller one located before you get to the loading zone) 

Highly recommend this spot!

Post note.. read a lot of reviews complaining about the rental lines and thereby giving this local hill a bad rap. How about renting in the city before you head up to the slopes? That just might save you the time to line up for the rentals. Then you only have to buy tickets.. which I have to say, does take longer than expected.",2019-02-25T03:57:04Z,103
28,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"I have been coming to Cypress for over a decade for winter and summer activities. I love the view of the cities from this mountain! It makes me feel more grateful to live in this beautiful and breathtaking province!

I have been snowboarding at night recently which is something I have never done before so my view was slightly different from my usual day view.

Every way you look at night is striking. When I looked up, I saw Orion's belt. I also saw the Vega star twinkling brightly beside the belt. When I looked down, I saw UBC, Richmond, Burnaby, Tsawwassen, basically the Lower Mainland. And when I look at the side, I saw the Grouse Mountain.

The easy runs are short but can be quite steep for beginners. I hear that advanced runs are super fun. I'll get to it once I know how to snowboard well!

Parking can be horrendous depending on the time of day you go. If you go after 5pm, you'll find quite a lot of parking spots as a lot of people leave around this time.",2018-03-31T20:23:58Z,103
29,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"I like Cypress compared to some of our local mountains. I  have taken lessons here and I like that the lessons are very reasonable priced and the instructors are very helpful. Compared to Grouse, Cypress do have long runs. Also the price is cheaper than Grouse. 

They also have night skiing as well.

If you want to save a few bucks! Here is what you do:
First go to Costco and pay $74.99 for 2 - $50 gift card
Now use one $50 gift card to buy a gold pass which cost $74.55 after tax and redeem on first time up
Second time going now show your gold pass and use your $50 gift card to pay for your snowboarding trip up (so now your day trip only cost you $37.5) 
All subsequent visit either buy more Costco gift card and combine the use with your gold pass or go online and buy 2 days advance and use your gold card.",2016-01-26T08:05:58Z,103
30,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Sadly won't be coming here again. I've been a season pass holder for 4 years and luckily did not buy one this year.

Took the day off work and paid $115 to ski today. Cypress sold out all their prebooked tickets for today yesterday, arrived at the hill and only one chair lift open! Arrived at 8:15am (to line up before opening) and got in 3 runs over 3 hours, so we left to go home. Clearly the mountain does not have the staff to run the mountain and should not be selling out lift tickets. The volume of people up there for one chairlift is insane.

Asked for a refund at guest services and was offered a 50% rebate in 'cypress bucks"". I feel a full refund is in order over the massive waste of time. So disappointed in what used to be my favourite local hill.",2022-01-05T00:04:39Z,103
31,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Easy to access, parking can be bad if you come on a busy day but on a good day you can ride out right to your vehicle!

Ticketing is easy and prices are fair. Use your best judgement and select the pass that works best for you.

The lifts and runs are fair but explicit. What you see is what you get.

Recommend to start as early as possible, have lunch in the lodge and ride again until you can't feel your legs anymore. Leave before it gets dark to avoid traffic on the way home. Night riding is icy in less optimal conditions.",2017-12-19T05:12:44Z,103
32,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"First time visiting Cypress Mountain for snowboarding and my first time experience on the slopes was incredible! The day I had gone was perfect ski/snowboarding conditions. Snowed all day and powder on every run! 

There are so many trails to choose from as Cypress has 3 mountains. There is lots of variety of skiing/snowboarding to do here, it's almost impossible BUT possible to hit all 3 mountains in one day. 

They have good beginner trails for beginners and long easy green trail runs for more intermediate/advanced riders. 

I had for the afternoon session where lift tickets and rentals are cheaper, but at 4pm lift and rentals are even cheaper. It depends how long and much you want to go for. 

The staff at Cypress are very helpful and very knowledgeable in questions and inquiries.  

Can't wait until the next time! Extremely great mountain ski/snowboard!",2017-02-24T20:28:00Z,103
33,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"I went to Cypress Mountain to ski for the first time in my life. Although I cannot compare this place to any other ski resorts, I have to say, it was a blast. I found the service there to be quick and efficient and the hills not too crowded. The views going up the lifts are gorgeous. Lastly, their online pricing is the best compared to all of the other places I looked at.",2018-01-14T18:15:02Z,103
34,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"If Cypress sold 1/3 the number of tickets it would be a decent 4* mountain. As it is now, you spend so much of your day driving up and down, walking from the massive parking lot, and waiting in lift lines for a mediocre mountain, it's not remotely worth it.",2021-12-20T07:49:52Z,103
35,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Cypress mountain boasts beautiful views and excellent scenery.  It is a skip and hop away from Vancouver, about a quick 30-40 minute drive.

On our particular hike, we decided to tackle St Marks summit as it's an intermediate hike (read: not for n00bs), about 11km and a gain of about 460 meters.  It'll take around 5-6 hours for the roundtrip depending on how slow or fast you go.  The trail itself in the beginning is quite easy, as the roads are covered with gravel or dirt.  As you ascend up the mountain, you will have to look out for the reflectors/markers to make sure you are staying on path as the trail is not always easy to distinguish.  Uphill gets pretty tough after the 2 bridges you have to cross, as the trail has ample amount of rocks, tree roots, bugs, and snow patches (even late august) here and there.  

Be sure to bring ample water, bug spray is a must, have decent hiking shoes and your camera for the stunning views at the top.  Breathtaking and definitely worth the sweat.    

For a comprehensive list of trails and difficulty and directions, I used http://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/",2011-08-31T18:28:44Z,103
36,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Cypress is the place to be if you're an intermediate to advanced skier or boarder, and don't want to drive up to Whistler.

Parking here is pretty decent, but be sure to get there somewhat early, as you really do not want to use that overflow lot.  There's a shuttle, but it still sucks.

In recent years they've added the Raven Ridge chair which doubled the effective ski area of Black Mountain, and added a pile of badly needed double blacks.  They also replaced the rental tent with this new lodge that looks pretty amazing, but could honestly be bigger.

The view here is amazing, but the clarity of the sky is hit and miss.

As for the food (cafeteria, not the Raven Ridge bar), the food is exactly what you'd expect.  Tastes like something straight out of highschool, but double the price.",2013-05-07T08:40:21Z,103
37,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"I wanted to share what happened to me yesterday:
2021 is my second year as a season's pass holder at Cypress Mountain Ski Resort. I went up for a day of snowboarding on Jan 7th, 2021 and in the process lost my cardholder which had my driver's license, credit card, debit card, and season's pass.  I found out when I came down from my first run and the staff wanted to check my pass.  Of course, I freaked out but every single staff was super helpful and guided me to check in with guest services. There, the lady printed another season's pass RFID card and didn't charge me the $5 replacement fee, and encouraged me to check with the run I did. I went to to the staff at Lion's Gate, and they haven't seen it but allowed me to bypass the huge line up (at least 20 mins line up) to go up and find it myself. At the top of Lion's gate lift, I thought I saw a corner of my cardholder near the drop off so I spoke with the staff there.  One staff asked everyone that came off the lift chair if they had seen my cardholder, and walked down and didn't see it and radioed their patrol staff, so 10 minutes later the mountain rescue patrol lady came and skied down with me inch by inch to find my missing cardholder.  It turned out to be a corner of a plastic bag stuck in the snow.  So she encouraged me to snowboard down to the base while she will go through my first run and look for it.  I snowboarded down and went to guest services and someone had returned it!  I'm beyond thrilled with the kindness and compassion and professionalism displayed by every single Cypress staff. I'm also very grateful to the good-hearted Samaritan who returned my cardholder. Thank you! I would highly recommend this ski resort for its friendly staff, easy parking, great facility. FYI, the first-year season's pass is $450, but once you get on their email list, they have an early bird sale for next year's season's pass for $250! Also once you have a season's pass, you can rent the whole season a pair of ski equipment or snowboard equipment for $99. www.cypressmountain.com 
So if you're feeling down about the chaos of this world, and your heart is feeling cold about humanity, I hope this story restores your faith in the kindness of others! There are still good people out there.",2021-01-08T14:34:16Z,103
38,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Today I rode my bicycle up Cypress Mountain Road that ends at the base of the the Ski Area. This is not a ride for the light hearted. There is more than 15K of uphill riding. Toady's ride was a mind altering experience.  I would call the roads grade changeling and even steep in a few places. 

With two great view points on the mountain. During off Ski Season other then restrooms there are no real services to speak of when your at top of the road. So pack snacks and water and a range of clothes. Mountains make there own weather.(Sleet on today's ride and its May 20) 

Riding down the Mountain is a thrill but use care and caution as some of the turns are fairly sharp and road is rough in places. A properly maintained bicycle is a must on this ride.",2012-05-21T00:11:26Z,103
39,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Rearranged my lift to finally get a day of skiing in only to arrive and discover a chairlift was down making virtually 1 mountain completely useless. Very disappointed considering we purchased tickets in advance and they had our emails but failed to notify us of the chair being down. But, just got an email telling the chair had reopened. I don't make a lot of money and well, my one chance to go skiing in 2020 was fitting of 2020.",2020-12-15T07:20:59Z,103
40,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"This review is for the guided snowshoe tour called  'Holly Burn Meadows' 

We arrived early, as we've been hearing that the parking lots are full. We actually had no problem parking near the bottom of the right turn you take to head towards the Nordic Centre. I would suggest parking in this area and walking up, that way you can avoid the chaos towards the top.

We checked in at the Nordic Centre to receive our passes, we had pre booked at the beginning of the week. After checking in, we headed to the rentals hut to pick up our snowshoes. I will note, the rentals hut was very busy and by 12:15 they had sold out of rentals. This didn't effect us, as ours were reserved with the tour. 

Still with time to kill, we headed into the cafe for a soup and hotdog before our tour. The cafe doesn't have the biggest selection, but the prices are reasonable. Would be cool to see them carry a healthy selection of local snacks. 

At 1pm we met our guide outside the warming hut. Kelvin, was easy to spot as he was wearing a bright red cypress jacket. We had never snowshoed before, so he helped us put them on. When everyone in our group (13 in total) was ready to go, he provided us with a brief intro into the technique. We all headed out of the crowed area towards the trails where we stopped for a longer lesson. 

We headed into the trails for a warm up. Kelvin guided us to untouched snow. There were areas that it felt like we were the only people on the mountain. We learned about the history of the mountain, the specifics of the alpine terrain, and how to play in the snow! 

The tour ended with delicious hot chocolate and a cookie. The tour was 38$ and lasted 2hours. To rent the snowshoes and trail pass at cypress, that would cost you 26$. So for someone who had never snowshoed before, I felt this tour was well worth it! 

I was super impressed with our guide and his truly radiant passion for the mountain. I would suggest this to anyone who is unfamiliar with snowshoeing.",2016-01-10T04:17:19Z,103

42,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Great:
- lots of variety. The downhill and nordic areas are extensive. 
- long hours. They have night skiing until 22:00. If you pick a weekday morning or night, you'll get many runs to yourself. 
- close to Vancouver. You can get great powder conditions without going far away, so the you can do other things in your day. Often, Cypress has more snow than Whistler or other local mountains. 
- free parking. This makes it so attractive. I don't feel like I am being gouged for money. 
- on the note of money, there are deals to be had here whether you get a day or season pass. I currently pay $300 + 49 for a downhill/Nordic/tubing season's pass. 

Need improvement:
- the faucets in the men's washroom in the main chalet are slowly falling apart. For three years, the same faucets haven been missing buttons are plain don't work.  Three years? 
- the same can be said for the backcountry lodge men's washroom. On top of that, some of  the toilets are not functional.",2018-01-14T23:26:57Z,103
43,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"mountain looks nice but we got into the rental line on 27 Dec 2018 and waited 3 hours to get to the rental counter and by that time it was 3pm and I had lost all interest in skiing.  I had got my two lift tickets online prior to coming to the mountain and had gotten them printed out at the mountain but never used them to ski or go through into the lifts. 
I emailed customer service the next day and told them how long I had to wait in line and I never used my tickets to ski and asked if I could use them on a subsequent day ...they refused saying it was only good for that day and they have no control over the length of the lines.  Well I dont think so...they sell the tickets and thereby they know how many tickets they have been sold so they actually do have control over the length of the lines.  And...it would have been nice to have a customer service rep standing somewhere near the line letting people know approx. how long the wait would be from various points along the line ...but NO, they had no staff anywhere near that line ...that obviously would not have been in the best interests of the mountain because telling ppl they have a 3 hr wait would most likely turn a lot of ppl away.

lesson learned: avoid this mountain ...its all about their $$$ ...not the joy of skiing ... unfortunately",2019-01-03T17:25:08Z,103
44,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"For the price and proximity to Vancouver, you really can't beat Cypress. The quality of the snow here might be sub par to Whistler and Mt. Baker, but remember you're 30-40 minutes away from downtown Vancouver. Just unbeatable in many respects. 

Friend had to rent her gear cause she just started riding and boy oh boy were the skis and boots outdated. 1990s grey Scott boots, not what you'd imagine getting for $50.00 as a day rental which is steep in my opinion. But alas, we did not come to Cypress for premium rentals, chocolate dipped waffles, heated seats, and massages. This was far from luxury. The mountain itself made the dainty old skis and unpleasantly rustic bathroom a far away thought.

The snow was pretty fresh considering the weather was in the 40's the day we went and mid 40's the entire week prior. Too bad we missed the early February 2 foot dump. Not all powder, but very easy to carve snow. The warmer climate melted a few parts and I noticed a few patches of slush, but not deep enough where your skis sink into water. Perhaps the packed snow and icy conditions from the east coast have kept my expectations tempered but wow, was the terrain easy to ride. There was a slight crowd on Saturday but no real lines at the lifts, 2-minute wait times tops. The Lions Express will lead you to most of the mountain and the Sky Chair can bring you closer to the peak. With Raincouver always battling the rain Gods, we too, had to face a fast moving fog as the warmer air changed the light snowfall into watery filled air. We had a good run from 10AM to 3:30PM, but by 3:30PM we had to constantly stop and wipe our googles. Boo, rain Gods, boo.

The slopes had plenty of room for you to dodge other folks without having to give up too much speed. And also, they have speed patrol monitoring the trails for reckless riders, so be sure to slowdown when approaching trail merges and learners areas. Will definitely come back again.

Our family ended up having a disappointing cafeteria dinner as the restaurant was 19 and over only. In all of this I never got a sincere apology , or even a fake sincere apology, from any customer service people. Train your staff Cypress and make sure they have consistent messaging.

The trails are free for snowshoeing/sledding which is what I came up for. If you want to do cross country, I believe it is about $15 or so for the trails. I didn't see how much the ski rentals are.

Restrooms are small, but plentiful. And flushing! 

The hot chocolate here isn't bad, at least it doesn't taste like a chalky made-from-powder type of beverage. One tip: if the cafe area is crowded, check out the trailer connected to the outdoor tent set up. It isn't marked and it is usually for folks waiting to go for lessons.

Fan-furken-tastic. This may be a nice place to ski but it's even better to hike. There are different names for all the trails but each one is a challenge in it's own way. The terrain is so varied. Lot's of elevation gain, trees, rocks and mountain streams, some muddy areas and meadows, board walks and wooden bridges in various stages of repair, and incredible, indescribable views of the whole of Vancouver, all the way out to Burnaby, south to the Delta and I swear - all the way down to the U.S. 
From another viewpoint we could see the Sunshine coast! No kidding. 
We watched ferry's cross Howe Sound, while we had our picnic above the clouds and a fearless Chipmunk begged for almonds from the toe of my boot. 

You can't get a bigger view unless you're flying in a air plane. 
What a day, what a hike. If I can do it, you can too.

In the summer there are a bunch of small lakes to check out some at the Ski resort level and a bunch on Black Mountain even some on the Hollyburn side!  There are also peaks to hike up like Black Mountain, Hollyburn Mountain and Mount Strachan.  There is also a long trail that leads from the resort area of the park and continues beyond past the Lions and multiple lakes and lets you out just down the road from Porteau Cove Provincial Park.

In the winter you can Enjoy the Ski Resort that takes up three of the peaks in the park or you can do some cross country skiing or snowshoeing!  Care has to be taken to reduce avalanche risks in the backcountry when you are enjoying true nature.",2012-04-05T15:10:28Z,103
52,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"For local mountains and skiing, this mountain is the best of the three. 

Seymour.  The runs are too short.  The black runs are not terribly challenging.

Grouse.  Not bad, but the biggest green run, is horribly crowded and, again short.

That leaves Cypress.  Two mountains to choose from.  Actually counting Skychair, it's three.  Two of the main mountains have green runs for the beginners, so the space opens up.  Hardly anyone goes up top to the skychair, which, on a sunny day, has the best views

Black Mountain and Mount Strachan.  They've opened up more terrain on Black Mountain in the past few years and have upgraded the chairlifts.  High speed quads instead of the rickety wooden things they had in yesteryear.  Yes, I've been skiing an awful long time.

IMHO, the best runs are Top Gun, a double black run,  and Moons, a black run.  Top gun is rarely open for the past times I've been up the skychair.  It's a tough run.  Moons is a fun run because is it secluded and is tough to find the opening to get to.  If you do find the opening, you ski through, in single file on a narrow path through trees to get to the open terrain, then the whole mountain opens up and it's as steep as stink!  I've freak out more than a few of my buddies going through this run through the trees.  I should mention that there is a bit of a cliff when you go through the trees to get to the run.  =)

But sometimes, in the same sentence, very pleasantly and at a normal talking speed told any white child to move; including the Nordic tourists who didn't actually speak English. 

Literally saw a little Asian kid go up to her and ask her (very politely) why they couldn't go in an area and she screamed in his face not to ask why and that X's mean NO. I get there are areas blocked off but there is no reason to be so rude and abrasive to children who are just curious.

55,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"This place is probably closer to 3.5 stars, but I'm willing to round up.

I decided to give Cypress Mountain a try this past weekend since I had some free passes to ski here. There are a lot of good aspects about this place. First, it is ridiculously close to Vancouver. As far as ski resorts go, this is as about as close as you can get to a ski area near a major city. Second, the views of Vancouver are really incredible. I'd highly recommend finding a clear day to come up here. I had to stop skiing a few times yesterday to look at the beautiful city lights, the sunset over the mountains and the city, as well as Bowyer Island. I've been up here both to hike and ski and these are truly some of the best views I've seen. Third, they are open 9 AM-10 PM, which is really long for a ski resort. Fourth, I was impressed with Crazy Raven Bar and Grill. I had some pretty good beers and a delicious salmon burger yesterday. Finally, I really appreciate that they don't scan your pass every single time you get on a lift (which is getting more and more common at ski resorts). 

The big downside in my mind about this place (and it is a pretty big downside as a skier) is that the runs are pretty short. You can get down almost all of them in about 5 minutes and then you have to get back on a lift. Also, some of the lifts are pretty outdated. I was pretty scared on some of the lifts because the bar to my side couldn't have been more than 4 inches tall. 

In sum, definitely a place worth checking out, especially if you have a Max Pass. I might also come back here and check out the snowshoeing.",2016-12-19T00:21:27Z,103
56,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"I love this park.  It's such a beautiful place, and so close to home.  Of the three local mountains, this one is my favourite.  It's a bit higher than the rest, so if conditions in the winter are bordering on melty-rain, Cypress is your best bet.  

There are lots of options for hikes here in the summer, including Hollyburn Ridge, Mt Strachan, and Black Mountain.  The road up the mountain is also a favourite for road cycling enthusiasts training for their next event.  And for a spectacular view of Vancouver and the Lower Mainland, not much beats the lookout half way up.  See my pics for proof!

In the winter your options are also varied.  The Nordic Park is where I spend my time, either snowshoeing their multitude of trails ($10 trail pass) or going up the busy but free Hollyburn Trail.  Cross country skiing is also a good bet here.  The trails are many, and half of them stay lit for evening skiing.  Go after 3 pm for cheaper rates ($34 for trail pass, classic ski rentals and waiver fee).  Also, don't forget the sliding centre!

The staff have always been very friendly, helpful, and totally enthusiastic about the sport they represent.  They have offered up great advice in the past.

Cypress is a fun place in the winter, and the warming huts and Hollyburn lodge are great places to warm up, get food, and meet other people.  New Years Eve at Hollyburn Lodge is cool, as there is a bonfire there every year.  I have been the last 2 years, and it's a great atmosphere.",2011-01-03T20:18:31Z,103

Next day she found out what she forgot to get back her passport.
We had plan to go Seattle next day. We were panic that time.

17th January, Actually we booked that day too for snowboarding by online. But it was heavy rain on the mountain and the Suttle was not working because of whether. We don't have car but we had  to get the pass port. With lent car or texi whatever...

Before we were living I tried to call the mountain part of lental team. I explained what's happened about her passport. And I asked them someone can bring down after work. The Phone holer asked to Supervisor. After that they said to me ""yes"" 

One guy who was bring down the pass port to Lonsdale near Starbucks. My Friend bought some cookies for him. So lovly people.. Finally my friend got that again. It was amazing service I won't forget that.

Actually i want to say one thing more..
17th January, we wanted to go snowboarding again. Unfortunately  it was heavy raining. We couldn't go there.

I got email from Cypress  about new ticket for another day.
I'm so happy for that. I will be there very soon. 

I also emailed about my friend that she went back to her country how you can help her. 
I got email again that was awesome. She already got the refund back. So cool.

60,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Went snowshoeing at Cypress for my first time today. We were amazed how close it is to downtown and the drive up provides lots of little areas to stop and get beautiful views of all of Vancouver. 

Parking can be tricky for the nordic area and if the lot is full, you'll have to resort to parking along the main road. You can purchase tickets both at the ticket booth and at the rental shops if you are renting. It's best to purchase at the rental office so you can ensure they have the sizes you need. There was a line out the door for snowshoes today but it moved quite quickly. Staff definitely were not pleasant when renting or returning equipment. They were rude to each customer in line and we were ordered out of the rental shop to wait for a staff member to address us outside when we were trying to do returns. Definitely need to work on that. 

You have the option of snowshoeing through Cypress regional park trails or through the mountain's patrolled paths. We went for the patrolled paths and found them easy to navigate. Green and blue runs are around the base and middle of the mountain, with black near the top. Black runs mainly just mean steeper hills to climb or descend down. We were able to cover the majority of the mountain in about an hour and a half. Maps are available at the base and are posted wherever a new run starts. 

Cross-country skiing and tubing are also available if you don't feel like making it an alpine day. We did see quite a few children on the green runs, though I wouldn't recommend taking them on blue runs unless they've got some extra energy to burn.",2011-01-04T05:23:19Z,103
61,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Best place to get some good skiing or snowboarding done on the Northshore.

Long runs, little to no lift lineups and an extensive variety of terrain. They were a host venue for the 2010 Olympics so I guess they do need these things. 

Compared to the other local mountains, Cypress has the best intermediate to advanced runs. Their charlifts have great coverage and they are fast, which is a good thing on those pow days. The snow is good since they have the highest altitude although it can get pretty foggy due to the bowl-like formation of the mountains. 

This year they really upped their terrain park coverage with new parks and features, even have an airbag which costs more to use (pay per-use). 

Their rental process for skis and snowboards is easy and everything is close to runs and lifts so no hiking or searching. Lift tickets and lessons are the priciest of the three mountains, but you get a lot more on-snow time since you don't wait around in lift-lines. 

Food is good, they have a nice variety not just typical pizza and fries (they even have veggies and healthy options, yay). A bit pricey, but that's to be expected on a mountain.",2013-05-01T21:44:21Z,103
62,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Took our staff party (12 people) up for a night of tubing. After calling twice to make sure of the hours and to ensure everything would go smoothly, we arrive at 5:15 to discover that they close at 6pm, not 10pm as I was told on the phone. When I spoke to the staff at the ticket counter, I was basically told that I was wrong, and no one told me that on the phone.

Bought the tickets anyway as the bus we rented had already left so we had to make the best of it. Went to the tubing hill to discover that out of the 1/2 a dozen runs available, only 2 were open, even though there was about 20 people lined up at each run. While we were waiting one person went down a tube run and made it to the snow fence at the end. They promptly closed that run as they now considered it ""unsafe"". So now 30 or 40 people are lined up for 1 open run with about 20 minute left in the night. All in all we spend $300 for each person in our group to have 2 runs down the hill. 

I spoke to several staff some of which were supervisor or managers and not once did anyone make any sincere effort to improve our experience or even apologize for the problems. The universal response was one of total indifference, they already had our money and they really didn't care what kind of experience we had. A couple of the staff were downright rude when I tried to address the problem. One of the supervisors actually pushed a person in my group and told him to get off the runs.

All in all a total wasted evening. I really regret choosing Cypress for my event and I wouldn't make the same mistake again.

63,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"With decent snow, Cypress is by far the best of the best for local skiing and boarding.
Even with every parking lot full, the lineups aren't more than 10-15 minutes. There are plenty of runs for all levels. Some excellent tree runs for those of us who like to get into the thick of it. 
As bad as it was for the Olympics, I think they did an amazing job of making it work. Now that the snow is falling, it looks like the dead of winter up there. Tons of powder and fresh tracks galore. I am definitely a fan, and I will be going every weekend and a few week nights for the rest of this season. See you on the slopes!

Quick Tips (since I don't have an Iphone):
1. The upper parking lot has finally reopened from the Olympic closure. Yay for closer parking! (March 27th).
2. The $2 lockers are great to stash your stuff while out on the hill. Skiers may want to wear their shoes to hike from the parking lots along the road, and then switch footwear at the lodge.",2010-03-14T20:32:12Z,103

Come and hang out here!",2012-12-07T05:28:46Z,103
65,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"The bumps and aerials were here in last year's Winter Olympics. Doesn't matter, this local mountain has got to be my favourite local Vancouver mountain. Yes for $58CDN day ticket, you will get an awful lot of people because it is minutes from the city. But do what I've always done in the last 30+ years, go up at 4pm and get an evening pass--$46CDN, and ski at night. If you forget your equipment in California, then just rent them. It is great at night....believe me. Depending on the year, the weather condition can range from dripping wet, Sierra cement, to downright frigid. Typically this year, you'll get 200cm of base, and around Feb it will be below freezing, say -3C. Hey, San Jose at night is that cold nowadays---global warming? How come I'm freezing. 

Love it here; especially at night, when shadows play tricks on every turn and the runs are scraped up from so many people all day. At the summit, when there's still day light, you can see the twin peaks of the Lions of Vancouver; when sun totally disappears, you can see a bit of the lights from Grouse Mountain, the next mountain over; and when it's a deeply cold night (ie no clouds), you have a spectacular sight of Vancouver's city lights as you ski down. 

Molson Canadian tastes mighty good apre skiing.",2011-02-28T05:38:59Z,103
66,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"The mountain was nice, but regarding the food I would have appreciated more options, and larger portions. I love seeds and inner bark of the cedar tree as much as anyone, and with the snowshoeing I had worked up quite an appetite, so only managing a handful of pine cones (and those under like four feet of snow!) after having foraged for at least an hour was a bit of a letdown. The water was good, but a little cold. 
I'm going to come back in the summer and see if they've worked out their supply issues.",2012-03-05T01:48:55Z,103
67,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Went tubing the other night. Wicked time! Typical West Coast weather: bit of snow, fog and then clear skies. The ice surface varied as well. Slick and fast when we arrived, then it really slowed down, then once the skies cleared and it got a bit colder, the runs again picked up speed. 
The rope tow was on the fritz for about 30 minutes, but the walk was easy. 
The attendants were really helpful. I was with a big group and at one point I think we went down the hill with 11 tubes attached. Krrraazzzy. With a K! They have to get pretty creative with their geometrical tube configurations.
Lots of fun. Everyone should totally take advantage of the hill before the Spring thaw.",2014-02-24T01:08:53Z,103
68,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Can only comment for SKIING: As far as local mountains close to a cool place to live, Cypress really can't be beat! Less than 30 minutes from downtown Vacouver...you just don't get that anywhere else. A lot of varied and fun terrain for a mountain of its size. I came here for maybe the 5th day I had ever been on skis, and there is a lot of green and easy blue terrain to keep a beginner entertained and challenged. Really friendly and helpful people on the slopes too...giving tips/riding along with you without being overbearing or pretentious about it. I went back again a couple weeks ago now that I'm a reasonably competent all-mountain skier, and had just as much fun exploring the black and double black runs for the first time. First time up Sky chair, and it has incredible views and really fun skiing. Hopefully they'll get a little chalet/cafe of some sort open up there someday.

It was a bluebird groomer day, but with some nice powder this place could be spectacular. Add in the night skiing and you have a really nice resort.",2013-02-27T02:08:00Z,103
69,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"When friends from Toronto asked me whether I would ever consider moving back East, the answer is a resounding, unsurprising 'NO.' Cypress Mountain plays a big role in this; as having such quality, year round outdoor activities just 30 minutes from downtown is something extremely rare and special.

In the winter, the ski hill offers the most terrain of any of the North Shore mountains, with a diverse array of cruisers, steep, challenging mogul runs, glades, and introductory runs. I'm not a park guy, but I understand their offerings here are solid as well. It is the night skiing on the hill that really stands out for me however; it is an absolute gift to live in a city where one can leave work at 5, ski from 6 until 10, and still be back on the job the next morning. If you can get up on a clear night, under a full moon, you hardly even need the sodium lights. 

The winter also offers excellent snowshoeing opportunities, both on the ticket trails of the resort, as well as free trails throughout the larger provincial park.

In the spring and summer (whenever the snow melts), hiking and backpacking trails begin to emerge throughout the park. In addition to day hikes of all difficulty levels, the area also boasts some of the best back-country camping on the North Shore (though be sure to bring your bug spray along!)",2011-11-18T16:31:12Z,103
70,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Cypress is my favourite local skiing and boarding in the past 6 years.  
We always have a great time up there...
I wish I could go up there more often in the day time. Most of the time we went there for night ski.  Sometime it could be very icy!   But, it is good thing we didn't need to wait for the long line up expect powder days.   With decent snow, good  location and friendly stuffs, I think Cypress is the best for local mountain.


I could give Cypress Mt. for 5 stars if there was no unfriendly staff at the tubing area yesterday!!

Yesterday morning  I took my 2 years old son to see some snow and we were hoping to see a snowcat.  We went to Nordic area first and we were lucky.  There was a snowcat on the tubing area.  I parked my car at the bottom of the hill.   We were inside the car for a few minutes because it was cold.  Then I decided to go to open the door for my son, so he could have better views to watch the snowcat. (200 ft away for us!!)

Here is the point,  there were two stuffs were working on the tubing area.  One stuff was on the snowcat and a lady was on the hill with her snow shovel (she was using her snow shovel sliding down the hill for fun.)  After I opened the door for my son and I hear someone called me.. She was quite far away from us.

Lady: Excuse me!
me: Yes! how are you?
Lady: We are trying to open the tubing area on this Friday.
me: yes that's great!  I just want my son to see a snowcat for a few minutes.
Lady: ""I don't think the cat wants to see you guys!!"" If you want to take your son for walk go to back of the parking lot.  ( she was very serious.)
Then she started to shake her head..
me: what?! you're being so rude!

May be she was thinking that we were there to play tubing or something..  At least she should talked us better than that or may be she should have listen to what is others people try to say! WTH??   Oh well I should  at lease get her name...   

I didn't want to bored, so we just left.... My son and I went up there to have a great time not for a drama..  I was very piss actually... I think every parents are smart enough to not take their kids to play around snowcat when they're working!  

The end of the day, we had a great time at picnic area and we will love to go back there again for some fun on the alpine side!

Cheers!",2010-11-24T01:01:20Z,103
71,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Cypress has become the top mountain on the North Shore.  The improvements to all the buildings is spectacular, the service I experienced surprised me it was so friendly, from a quick walk-by question to a staff member on the hill to consulting with staff from the rentals shop and all the eats & hot chocolates in-between I was met with smiles, courtesy, and a willingness to help.  

I would give it 5 stars, but it is quite expensive to enjoy the Ski/Snowboard aspects of the hill.  Not the best prices for a family, but if you and a friend have equipment and don't mind shelling out a total of $140 for both your lift tickets, it's an excellent experience. Some of the good stuff:

Quad Chairs
Two Hills
Higher Elevation (less slush)
Huge Bar & Grille
Tons of parking, overflow parking has frequent shuttle service",2011-01-13T05:07:26Z,103
72,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"We tried lessons for our 7 year old last year at Grouse, but wanted to give Cypress a try this year. First lesson the weather was wet and cold, and our kid was crying afterwards because he was so cold. It was likely a combination of old gloves and not enough layers on our part, and a bit of inexperience on the instructor's part. 

I spoke to Jon, the manager on duty and I appreciated that he listened, apologised and ensured me that this would not happen again. Since I'm giving them a 5 star review, you can guess that he stood by his word. And after talking to our kid later on, he said that in spite of the cold, he had a great time. Go figure.

The following week, my son was back in a lesson and he had a different instructor named Lisa. She was fantastic! My kid was very, very happy with the lesson... and dry and warm.

We've only been up to Cypress twice this season, but we couldn't be happier, especially with all the staff and the facilities (bathrooms could be cleaned more often, though).

Even the guys outside who came around to help dig our car out and get us home are awesome. They go above and beyond and deserve a lot of credit for providing a good customer experience.

Well done Cypress! Keep up the good work. Highly recommended.",2015-12-18T06:31:32Z,103
73,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Went to Cypress today with my student society; we decided a good way to spend our money would to be to go snow tubing for two hours! When we got there, the weather was beautiful and sunny, the staff was very friendly, and the lines weren't very long. Eventually, the lines felt like they took hours, though, because it started snowing really hard--something that isn't Cypress's fault, but it did take from the experience. 

Giving it four stars because despite having several snow tubing lanes, each run only lasts about 10 seconds. So, we'd wait for ten minutes to have a ten second run. For $19 (tax included), it was a pretty fun way to spend two hours, though! (They even let us go on hour runs as an 8-person group!)",2013-02-17T02:59:21Z,103

Now though everything seems very organized and understandable. The staff are friendly, the snow is great and the views are spectacular. This is truly the reason you live in Vancouver.

My only complaint is that the learner hill is right beside some of the more advanced runs and the really fast and aggressive skiers/snowboarders cut down for a shorter ride. But hey, once you are off the bunny hill go wild and have fun.",2010-12-30T21:52:34Z,103

After participating in this amazing race, the next day, we entered the Cypress Challenge (a 8 mile charity 5,000 ft climb up Cypress Mt). I never made it to the race, since I had gotten lost... But I did eventually find this mountain. I must say, in the opinions of a small girl from the small island of Hawaii, this mountain was amazing!! The roads were so clean and well maintained, no potholes. I didn't even whine when climbing up the hill that much! I was too busy admiring the scenery and was amazed by the nicely paved road.",2015-08-30T22:13:50Z,103

79,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Yes, this ski resort offers great option of being closer to the city and open till 10pm but you have to remember number of people and wait time is going increase exponentially. On Sunday after New Year day I had to wait in line for two hours to get my rentals.. By the time I got to check out my better and cheaper option was just to get a rental for half a day. But their system is really outdated and if you want to get half day rental you have to be there at 2pm not earlier. Their stuff is really nice and let me come back at 2pm and skip the line. Also you have to pay separate for helmet if you don't have one. It is included in the price at Whistler for example. If you have your own equipment and pass it is probably not too bad option to get snowboarding or skiing just 30 minutes away from town.",2016-01-17T20:59:32Z,103

During the winter, the slopes here are great for beginners and intermediate skiers/snowboarders. The bunny hill is a great place to learn (as I did) and the blue and green runs aren't too difficult, but long and challenging enough to keep you entertained.

Lessons are available as are packages to save you some money if you intend to frequent the mountain. Although the food at the restaurant on Cypress Mountain is okay, I have to give praise to the soy London Fog served at the 'Gold Medal Cafe'. It's amazing!

Food - garbage - we never eat here, just bring something.

Snow - most years its awesome.

Parking - TONS of it

Lifts - SMALL lines most the time, avoid weekends if you can. And any time kids are out of school is a Zoo.

My only pet peeve is Skychair is closed so much and its the oldest 2 man chair you have ever seen.

82,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"I had an enjoyable time at this mountain. It isn't the biggest ski area I have been to, but it was literally minutes from my hotel in North Vancouver. I got lucky and made my trip the day after a good snowfall. Even so, I did hit some icy spots. Talking to some of the employees, they said this is often a problem. They also mentioned that this has been a bad winter for snowfall and they usually get more snow than Whistler. Regardless, I found some powder and was happy. The mountain was big enough to keep me entertained until I got tired enough to stop for the day but not so big that I was completely lost on it. 

It was pretty overcast when I was here, but the sky cleared a few times revealing gorgeous views of Vancouver and Vancouver bay. 

Overall, I would say that there is something here for all skill levels. However, more advanced riders will probably be looking for something more after a few days of skiing this mountain.",2013-01-20T15:57:16Z,103
83,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Disclaimer: I've decided I don't like skiing/winter sports and had only been skiing 2 times before coming to Cypress (once at Crystal and once at Mt. Baker). Compared to those mountains, I think Cypress is much, much better for beginners. The drive from Seattle might be a little long, but on good weather days, it is much easier overall than Crystal, Stevens Pass, and Mt. Baker. Excluding Vancouver city driving, you only have to do non-freeway driving up a wide, relatively straight mountain road for about 15 minutes. We did have to take a parking shuttle when coming on a sunny Saturday, but it was a very short ride. We left Seattle at 7 AM, took breaks for gas and breakfast, and were at the slopes by 10:30 AM. Of course, the experience is probably much different in inclement weather. Without traffic and border delays, the drive time from Seattle is pretty comparable to driving to Mt. Baker even though the distance is further.

These are the things that impressed me about Cypress:

-Very welcoming service. Everyone in the rental area was super friendly. I think a lot of them were young Australians/Europeans, as they had cool accents. They seemed happy to be there. The rental ski boots were also more comfortable than ones I've had in the past.
-More casual, relaxed environment. They had music playing at the lodge area and Kind Bar and Red Bull stands handing out free samples. I also think it helps that Canada/Vancouver is more multicultural, so there were a wider variety of people and different ski abilities compared to the resorts in WA state. At Crystal/Mt. Baker, it was common to have little kids zipping by you doing perfect parallel turns. Here, there seemed to be a larger number of learners, which helps a little bit psychologically, in my opinion.
-Well-maintained bunny slope and good separate area for learners. The lift line areas at Cypress were well designed. The Easy Rider chairlift had gates to show you exactly where to stand.
-Very long green runs. Panorama and Collins are long, wide, and good for practicing without getting bored. My friends who had also been to Stevens Pass and Snoqualmie said Cypress was much better for beginners.
-Great views of Vancouver! It was foggy for some of the day when I was there, but when the clouds cleared, it was great to see views of Howe Sound, Vancouver, the water, islands, and Mt. Baker in the distance.
-Much cheaper than the Seattle area resorts (except Mt. Baker). Lift tickets alone for Snoqualmie and Stevens on peak days is $89. Adding a rental is another $40+. With the exchange rate right now, I was able to get a full day lift ticket + rental for about $111 CAD, or $89 USD by buying tickets online a few days in advance. I believe the full day lift + rental without buying it in advance is $120 CAD, which is still cheaper than the Seattle area resorts.
-Even on a sunny Saturday, the lift lines were never too long. Also, the chair lifts slow down a lot at boarding areas. The slow speed at the loading area makes for more relaxed boarding and unloading of chairlifts compared to the Washington state ones I experienced. The offload areas are also graded very gently. In my opinion, for beginners, this is a much better experience. As a side note, the offload area on the Crystal Discover slope was a little steep when I was there, and the chair moves kind of quickly. I saw lift operators at Crystal yell at snowboarders who had fallen while unloading from the beginner's lift :(. The chair lifts at Cypress move slowly enough that people were able to get out of the way more easily.

I did not take a lesson, but I'm sure it would have been more helpful here than my Level 2 lesson at Mt. Baker. During my 1.5 hour lesson there, we spent more than half of the lesson time waiting in line for the rope tow, and the instructor seemed a little too concerned about beginner skiers damaging her expensive skis....

I really appreciated how well-run this place seems and also the friendly, welcoming vibe. It gave me a much more positive perspective on winter sports than my experiences in Washington state.",2018-04-16T05:44:48Z,103

A lot of people say that Grouse is closer, and it is, but you then have to ride the tram to the top which makes the time difference roughly the same and Cypress is, for what it's worth, a bit bigger and has less of a crowd on a weeknight, I feel.

I like jumps and jibs a bit as well and they accommodate in that department. some nice, decent sized stuff, and then have an airbag that you can practice big air tricks on without having t crunch your bones when you miss the landing. 

All in all, it's still a small mountain, so if you want a weekend getaway, just go to Whistler, but for a really affordable lift ticket and no money spent on gas, I ALWAYS choose Cypress.",2014-03-26T16:19:45Z,103

90,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"""It's a wild mountain. I've never been here before. I'm excited. It's a pretty cool spot."" - Shaun White.

This quote takes a place of honour at Cypress (hahaha, wtf?) but honestly, Cypress IS a ""pretty cool spot."" Winter boarding/ skiing is pretty fab for a local mountain... three chair lifts going to a decent variety of runs, close enough to go to the mountain post-class/ pre dinner... and a chilled out atmosphere (share a pitcher w your buddy & enjoy the snow -- I say snow vs. pow cause Whistler seems to have a monopoly on pow.) Moguls are almost non-existant here for some reason, their park is a bit hurt, and it's really full of people who don't know how to snowboard/ ski (no big, I was one of you people too! -- just be wary that you may have to watch out for people hitting you vs. when I'm at Whis and ppl have to watch out for me! haha) but it's a fun day. Especially, like last year, if you drive a VW like me, cause they do promotions w local business dealers (1/2 off the lift pass is Always a win).

What else can I say. 

The summertime is pretty fantastic too. I would not recommend St. Mark's Summit hike, because while I enjoyed the 5 hours of solitude (compared to the chief/ the grind, very few ppl do this hike) and easy/ intermediate hike (very earthy.. lots of roots, rocks, and switchbacks) there are a TON of bugs. Think ""I must talk less lest a fly flys in my mouth and I unintentionally take in some extra protein"". Oh yeah, and the view's not as awe inspiring as the Chief.

92,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"PROS:

- 30 minutes from downtown Vancouver
- Gold Medal Card: pays for itself in just one full-day visit; pay only $36 (tax in) for Night Owl ticket (5-10 PM)
- lots of shuttle buses go there throughout the day (~$20 round trip)
- GREAT summer hiking!
- decent food options
- very empty on weeknights, lift lines non-existent
- great for beginners: lots of easy going runs
- great for non-beginners (in the daytime)
- tons of snow!
- great views!
- alpine, cross-country & snow shoeing options!


CONS:

- PACKED on weekends
- parking lot: nightmare if it's busy (you might have to walk for 15 minutes with all your gear), and the ""priority"" parking lot is $10
- night skiing is poorly lit (although that's just my opinion)
- skiiable alpine terrain is limited, so it can get boring if the lifts are all empty

93,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Great customer service! I love the mountain as well. Strongly recommend Black Mountain over Mount Strachan, the blue runs are gorgeous, beautiful views. Run recommendations-- green: Panorama is personally better than Collins. blue: Maelle Ricker's Gold(Upper Fork) is also a beautiful run, some small moguls when we went that made it a lot more fun. It's also nice at Cypress how there are usually a blue, black, and green way down, so my party split up so that we could all ski what we were comfortable to. And for black trails, anything from Raven Ridge is AMAZING. However, rainbow(take horizon down from Lions Express) is also nice. Night skiing is also super at Cypress. Plenty of runs have lights, so they stay open late and its great after a day in Vancouver. TIP: on busier days, if you're an intermediate to advanced skier, take Raven Ridge Quad, as there is a much shorter wait. However, this chair does close pretty early, I believe 3 PM. And Sky chair(take lions express over) has some good trails, and T-33(blue) and Rip Cord(black) both have lights, so you can ski/ride even at night. We had a slight issue at Cypress with a lift, but Cypress was totally cooperative and understanding, and we were refunded. GREAT MOUNTAIN, nice environment, I love it! Even within the harder trails, all the blacks are varying difficulty, which is unexpected.

The view is awesome. You can ski down fresh snow and look around and there's great sites. Like the city, the other day it was covered in fog and you could only see the tops of the buildings. Amazing.

They have short lift lines. You don't have to wait to long to get on a lift.

They have the best location. There're about 30 to 40 mins away from my house depending on traffic. You can see the city on one side and the ocean on the other.

The people who work there are very nice. They help me get my equipment  and help me on the hill.

The food there is not the best but its ok. It's nice to have a warm drink after being out in the cold so it not bad but ok.

The cost is good they have great deals on all things. Me and my brother got a lift pass because we ski a lot.

96,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"4 Stars based on the mountain, if I was going to rate the food... 2 stars.

This is my favorite of the 3 local mountains we have in the the beautiful city of Vancouver.  The larger, nicer, and more expensive of the 3.  Can you believe it, they won North Shores best mountain 3-4 times in a row.  It's like watching Canada vs Kazakhstan in hockey, I mean unless Seymour is going to grow a new side of the mountain to compete with Cypress, I think Cypress is always going to take gold every year.

I only come here for the winter and the best time to come here, in my opinion is Feb-April.  I know it sounds late, but go take a lot as the previous year's snow report and those are the best times on the mountain.  Why go in December when it's all icy and people are all on break.  Go during the ""off"" times when everyone is at work and in school.

97,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"I LOVE Cypress Mountain. It is THE reason I live in Vancouver. Snowboarding was phenomenal last week before the holidays proper, no lines and fresh snow! Today was quite busy but still there were good runs. Very suitable for beginners and intermediates, or shredders just itching to ride, after all Cypress is less than an hour's drive from downtown. At dusk, the sun casts a warm orange glow on the surrounding mountains and still ocean waters that truly make Vancouver a magical place to be.",2010-12-29T07:56:20Z,103
98,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"Cannot recommend a ski lesson here.  What would you call a ski instructor who skis ahead of the group, not watching what the students are doing, not teaching any techniques, basically enjoying himself with his priority lift ticket you paid for, other than a moocher?   A honest day's work for an honest day's pay would be helpful here.",2016-02-22T21:26:51Z,103
99,Cypress Mountain,3.7,"I was good for a day now and then over the years, now it's much better. I have friends ;) so I get a few passes every winter and have been impressed with the development of Cypress. I'm glad they got the big O and will have even better infrastructure for us after 2010. This mountain has very reasonable season passes and give credit to pass holders should the season be less than stellar. I am looking forward to the Board events during the Olympics. They also have the most comprehensive Nordic trail system in the lower mainland which I don't know anything about because no lift I'm not there.",2009-10-01T17:42:35Z,103

101,Embarc Vancouver,3.5,"Great location and fantastic views!  The Embarc is located on the top floors of the Sheraton.  The views of the harbor, city and mountains were awe inspiring.  The suites were smaller than the other Embarc's we have been to, but it was big enough for us for the week.  The kitchenette allowed us to make breakfast in the mornings and heat up late night snacks as well.  We were within walking distance to the bus and bike rental places as well.  We used both to get around the city. Plenty of places to eat and drink within a few blocks as well.

Check in was smooth.  We were allowed to check into our room early.  The room was clean and looked fairly new.  The lounge upstairs was nice and offered coffee 24/7 as well as a computer to use.  We used the telescope to look around the city as well.  Nice touch.

We loved Vancouver and are already planning a trip back in a few years.  Definitely would stay here again.",2018-12-04T18:16:37Z,6
102,Embarc Vancouver,3.5,"A time share resort which we don't belong to, but also available to book for non-timeshare members. Just be aware that you need to proceed all the way down the underground parking to P1 North Tower or you'll be totally confused. I came up the elevator, I believe in the South Tower, and was then informed that I needed to walk outside to the North Tower to check-in for the Embarc Hotel. Located on the upper floors. You'll be checked in by the Sheraton desk clerks. Don't even try calling the Embarc number provided, their office hours are from 9-5 and that's mostly recordings. I had to call my poor wife who was still waiting in the parking structure to continue down until she saw me in P1 North Tower. Very confusing.

Once we were checked-in and made our way to our room on the 29th floor, the view seemed to make it all worthwhile. But unless you're staying at least 6 nights don't expect any maid service. Plenty of kitchenware for meals though, with a microwave and small refrigerator if you want to store and heat your meals like we did. Just enough amenities for our 2 night stay in Vancouver, before boarding our ship this past Friday for the main part of our vacation, an Alaskan Cruise. Just remember ""P1 North Tower"" parking. Self Parking $21.00 per day, Valet Parking $23.00 per day.",2019-05-11T18:09:12Z,6
103,Embarc Vancouver,3.5,"Over the years, my wife and I have enjoyed staying in this beautiful Intrawest Club on the mid-upper 3 floors of the Shearaton Hotel. We love this place for (1) the spectacular views of the city and harbor right out of the floor-to-ceiling windows of our unit; (2) its convenient locale to various businesses and attractions. FREE  wifi in room and the Club Lounge. Yes, they have fitness and swimming facilties.

Club Intrawest is mainly for members, but non-members can also stay when there is vacancy. The place is well appointed, although a bit dated. It can be noisy if the upstairs unit is occupied. 

DETAILS (YOU CAN SKIP)

1. CONVENIENT LOCALE TO FUN PLACES

This place is conveniently located in the Wall Center business district, walking distances to various attractions such as Yaletown, Gastown, Stanley Park, Waterfront to Granville! 

The famed Capilano Suspension Bridge Park is located in North Vancouver. One can take the SEABUS (a ferry boat) accross the water to N. Vancouver. 

- Indeed, my wife and I visited all those places and had a wonderful time! 

2. ALL ROOMS HAVE SPECTACULAR VIEWS

The types of units vary from studio to 1-bedroom suite with 1 or 2 baths, but ALL come with spectacular views of the city, harbor and mountain ranges - the ""wall"" facing the city and harbor is ALL floor-to-celing glass! 

Our ""1-bedroom, 2bath and notch"" unit has a relatively spacious, nicely furnished living room, which has a great view, of course; a kitchenette with a large island-counter, small fridge, microwave, dish washer, wet bar, cabinets for cups an dishes; but no stove. The front entrance closet has a safe bolted on the floor. A hot water pot is provided for coffee and tea. Free wifi in the room. The bedroom suite is small with a queen size bed; has a corner sitting area, a cloth closet, a cozy bathroom, AND another small, charming area with bathtub and a bench seat; AND YES, a VIEW from the bathtub through the glass wall, too! For the view, each unit comes with a telescope for good measure! The small guest bathroom is has a shower stall.

Its small Club Lounge on the 29th floor has a very comfortable sitting area, and of course, spectacular views! During business hours, it offers free coffee and concierge service. The concierge in this lounge and at the lobby are very friendly and helpful with good info on various attractions, hiking, dining, happy hours, entertainments.

Unlike typical Intrawest Club Properties located in a golf, ski, or water resort, this particular Club is within the Shearaton Hotel in downtown Vancouver.  We have stayed in different Intrawest Club Properties in several states in the US, as well as in Canada and Mexico, and we like them all; this one in Vancouver is one of the few we frequently come back to. 

3. A FEW MINOR POINTS: 

- The unit can be quite noisy, if the one above yours is occupied.

- Although the property is quite well furnished and maintained, it is a bit dated. 

- The bedroom is quite small and only has a queen size bed. 

- The SAFE is placed too low to the floor, a bit difficult to access. 

- Unlike most other Club Intrawest properties, this one does not have free self service laundry facility.

104,Embarc Vancouver,3.5,"I had the unfortunate experience of staying on a night when the fire alarm went off. I already provided feedback to Club Intrawest but the main issue is the fire alarm going off only for a minute, and leaving everyone on my floor confused as to whether or not we should continue to evacuate. Normally, I would, but then a series of PA announcements told us to wait for further instructions - at 1:30am, my brain could not tell if that meant it was a false alarm or if we should run for our lives. Since this location is run by the Sheraton, which occupies the floors below, there's definitely some back and forth as to whose fault things are. 

I've stayed with CI at this location a few times now and here is my general feedback:
*The HVAC system in the rooms are really loud. The one in the bedroom is so loud and turns on and off so suddenly I could not sleep with it on. 
*The walls are pretty thin and so when the neighbors decide to have a party on a Sunday night at 12:30am, you'll hear everything.
*Be sure to turn down the ringer of the room phone - the same night the fire alarm went off at 1:30am, the room phone rang at 4:30am. The hotel staff couldn't track the call down. 

Now onto the pluses:
*Really appreciate the alarm clocks that have USB, Lighting and legacy iPod/iPhone connectors for charging
*Water from the taps looked clean to drink
*View is good - great close in location helps!

If CI members have questions or concerns, better call the main CI number rather than CI Vancouver. I first called CI Vancouver with my feedback above and the lady had no interest in my feedback and directed me to comment cards that get mailed to us. She have must been the CI employee on the 29th floor of the hotel who was more interested in watching Football on TV than running the club!",2016-01-18T21:32:59Z,6
105,Embarc Vancouver,3.5,"The two most important things in the room (#2960) left something to be desired: the bed sagged in the middle and the chairs sagged too!  (The chairs were wood framed with wide leather strips loosely woven, causing them to sag over time)  

Everything else about the room and our stay was really great.  Nice bathroom, nice kitchenette, nice TV, great view, good climate controls.  

Unfortunately, a sagging bed and sagging chairs led to our backs going out (I'm still dealing with that two weeks after!).  Not a great endorsement.  If C.I. -Vancouver fixed those two things, I could have given them 5 stars.",2012-05-06T17:29:28Z,6
106,Embarc Vancouver,3.5,"If they call you up offering you a discount or free holiday with the exception that you do the time share presentation...don't go. They almost hold you hostage against your will until the presentation is over even if you want to leave well before then. I am not sure how they got my phone number 'in the first place cause clearly I'm not in their financial demographic who can even afford time share or benefit from it. The presentation was nice, we got food, however, I made it clear from the first moment that I was not interested at all nor 'cause I afford or want part of it. I initally agreed to the ""holiday"" as I was promised that there would be no pressure and that I could leave at any time during the presentation.",2014-04-11T18:45:30Z,6
107,West Trek Tours,1.0,"Warning! Risk of life!
This tour operator works very dangerous and with the sole purpose of making money!
The accommodations they describe as comfortable are terrific cabins, some with no drinking water from taps.
The worst thing, which puts the passenger's life at serious risk are the buses, with rebuilt tires and tread-offs.
We were stopped for this by the police, who rightly blocked the bus forbidding to continue. 
We waited for more than 9 hours of help in the night, in the mountains, on a trail of the freeway in the forest, that they would be rescued. 
These incapable people came from Calgary, far more than 430 miles of small buses, instead of getting cabs from Jasper, near 15 minutes, to get us to sleep there fast.
 Not to spend extra, they brought us where the reservation was and we arrived in this last dreary dorm at 4 and a half in the morning, after a nightmare.

108,Whistler Connection,2.8,"Whistler Connection is fast - I think we made the trip in under 2 hours.  They use mini-busses rather than the giant ones, so loading and unloading is faster than rivals.   

The only thing to think about is that, unlike their competitors, they don't have a scheduled departure time.  That means that you might wait a bit (up to 1 hour during the day and 2 hours at night) for the ride to get started.  That can be either a good or a bad thing.   It's exhausting to get off a long flight, get your bags, wait 2 hours and then have a 2 -3 hour drive.  The good side is that if your flight or baggage is delayed, you won't risk missing the bus.  
I personally like having time to get something to eat and stretch my legs before another long time sitting down.  

The bus itself it new and quite comfortable.  Every row has a usb charger outlet.  It can get a little cold in the back, however, and there's no wifi.

Customer service is excellent.  Their agents texted me when I was late due to a lost bag.   I also accidentally left my wallet on the bus.  They immediately found it and hand delivered it to my address.",2019-12-29T17:59:05Z,10
109,Whistler Connection,2.8,I have always used this shuttle service to Whistler ski resort and return to from Vancouver airport. Service is always excellent and friendly from the service counter to drivers. There is no need to check on your return reservation back to the airport as they have always shown up right on time. Their bus pick-up and drop-off is at marker #11 which is right past the exterior door to the left of their service counter. A great value for the price.,2019-04-12T21:12:43Z,10

So why 2 stars? Our driver was quite obviously a heavy smoker.  He was smoking at the airport right before we loaded. When we all loaded in the van at the airport we were floored by the cigarette smell coming from the driver and presumably his clothes.  It was so overpowering some of my family members felt nauseous.  Thought it would get better at the stop in Squamish when the van could air out but no, he had a another cigarette.  Drivers should be coached on this. What could have been a very good experience was spoiled.",2020-03-12T16:34:51Z,10

Before I get to far in I want to note that this company supposedly has a 1 hour wait time guarantee. That being said I waited well over three hours for my shuttle. The staff had no clue when the next shuttle was going to be leaving. I started my day at 4 am East Coast time with two flight stops on the way here. This was by far the longest most exhausting most terrible part of my trip. Whistler Connection is terrible 0/10 would never recommend and next time I will be hitchhiking.,2019-01-16T07:14:15Z,10

Sent email to booking company and WC and received no reply. Called WC and received another snarky dismissal that my pickup is scheduled.

118,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"First time in a seaplane and highly recommend! Breathtaking views! Very nice captain who had my husband be co pilot :) Smooth take off and landing.

We bought our tickets the day before but I do believe they sell out. It was a 35 minute flight and I think it was worth it! Check the forecast if you are there a few days in case of fog. Highly highly recommend this experience",2024-01-08T20:48:57Z,66
119,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"What a wonderful experience we had with Harbour Air! They were on time, the little airport harbors are delightful, and the staff are all wonderful. We flew from Vancouver to Victoria for a day trip. On the way to Victoria, the pilot chose me to sit up front with him! I was allowed to wear the headset and listen to the local air traffic controller. Very cool experience. They fly at 1000 ft, so it was a very smooth flight. The views from the plane were gorgeous. Take off and landing on the water was smooth and fun. The plane ride back from Victoria was equally lovely while sitting in the passenger area of the plane. 

I highly recommend Harbour Air if you only have a day trip from Vancouver to Victoria. The flight takes 35 minutes, versus a 1.5 hour ferry ride. It's well worth the cost.",2023-09-08T03:26:45Z,66
120,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"We were in Vancouver for a weekend and decided that we HAD to check out seaplanes! This was one of the best decisions we could've made - we had a fantastic experience. 

We booked our tickets well in advance, and got the package that included tickets to the Capilano Bridge - it was expensive, but I guess you are paying for the experience. It was a bit hard to find their office, but once we got there, we checked in and were on our way around 30 minutes later. They took the group down to the water where they loaded all of us on. There were around 11 seats, which felt a little cramped once we were inside. 

The tour, however, was fantastic. We saw all of the city of Vancouver, and the colors looked brilliant from high up. It's also a cool experience when taking off and landing in the water!

Definitely recommend this to folks looking for a tourist activity in the city, or even trying to get around - they do round trips in addition to tours!",2023-08-19T00:34:53Z,66

They have a little gift shop: souvenirs, luggage, incidentals, some clothing, etc. They offer complimentary coffee and tea for their customers. They also sell coffee drinks, wine, beer, and some mixed drinks, as well as some snacks.

Flight was a little turbulent due to weather. There was an unpleasant strong smell of petroleum during the flight.  However, the flights were beautiful! Highly recommend this company AND the adventure of flying on a seaplane!!!",2023-04-09T00:38:59Z,66

From booking to checking in, complimentary coffee/tea/water. Available snacks. On time and as promised....to the unbelievably beautiful 35 minutes flying low across The Salish Sea. As a born and raised Vancouerite I thought I couldn't love our corner of the world more...and yet here we are. The crews were awesome - in particular the return crew where it was ""David's birthday"" -- which I think was code for ""first flight at the controls"". The Senior Officer on board was a steady hand and we all marvelled at the smoothest of landings. (It might have been David's actual birthday....please do let me know!).

125,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"I'll start my review with the positive, the flight tour was beautiful, left on time. pilot was awesome & friendly to me and 3 1/2-year-old son.
We had tried to get on a tour in Victoria a few days prior and their customer service was amazing. My son was disappointed but the lady at the desk made his day by giving him a toy Sea plane as a consolation and he skipped back to our hotel happy.

We decided to do the tour in Vancouver. Got to Terminal 45 mins before our departure. Lady at the counter was hesitant on my booking as it had my name as Jimmy on the booking but James on my ID. I guess it autocorrected on the booking. She seemed hesitant about it, and I explained that it was the same name. Her colleague possibly a manager at the next desk turned to her and us and in his most condescending voice explained that we are booking an aircraft .NO way dude I thought it was a Sea-bus. All the time I've a 3 1/2-year-old on my shoulders trying to control him. We checked our bright yellow and purple baby shark bag in with them they gave us a small paper ticket for retrieval of our bag after the tour. I'm juggling Lego, snacks, boarding cards, bottles and my son ...I took a photo of the ticket as insurance in case it got lost in the clutter. After our 20-minute tour we returned to retrieve the bag.
Same lady that gave me the ticket was there perfect!!
Ticket was gone, showed her the photo I had taken. Mean time I'm holding my son back as he is about to walk behind the counter and grab his bag, he is now screaming for it. Lady ascends on to her elevated imaginary horse and tells me that she can't give me the bag without the ticket even after showing her the photo of it. She reluctantly gave me the bag to my upset son. I'm livid now and she explained to me that next time she wouldn't give me the bag without the actual ticket. Told her there won't be a next time that the tour was amazing, but your customer service is horrible.

Ok so it's been playing on my mind a bit but there are literally no security checks getting on the plane, pilot door is wide open and he's reachable. But then their going pull all this matching identical IDs at check-in and not release a bag for security reasons to a 3-year-old after the flight.

OWNERS-TAKE NOTE.
Lot of mixed signals from your company it's such a shame that a few bad apples at check in let your company down as the plane experience was amazing. I see I'm not the only one that has had an issue with your customer service.",2023-07-28T16:08:25Z,66

My only complain was that the 30 minute flight, while a really cool experience, was awfully expensive.

130,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"This was a great experience. The pilot's name was Mick. As we were boarding the plane, Mick offered for one of the passengers to sit in the co-pilot seat and he politely declined. My wife overheard the conversation and offered me up. I was excited. I got to sit in the cockpit with Mick. 

Harbour Air is the main company providing seaplane transportation in the Pacific Northwest. The terminal is very neat and clean and comfortable. They have complimentary beverages and fruit for passengers waiting for their planes. The staff was friendly, and offered the best service possible. They were very accommodating and all worked together. The teamwork in this organization is very strong, it was obvious. 

We checked in and got our boarding passes. I had a cup of coffee and my wife had a small piece of cake and a pastry. As we waited for our plane I watched as several planes were boarded and took off from the water. I had never actually seen a real seaplane so it was really interesting for me. 

So when our time came we boarded and I got in the front. It was REALLY EXCITING. After a few minutes in the air, Captain Mick started a conversation with me and we had a great chat while flying across to Victoria. Naturally, he had to pay attention to flying the plane so there were interruptions but it was a nice conversation. 

We landed (on the water,of course) for my first time. It was a very smooth landing. We taxied on the water for a spell and tied off to the dock. After exiting the plane the bags were removed for the owners to claim. What a great experience. We thought about taking the Ferry Boat but chose the plane for the experience. So glad we did. I can't wait for the return trip!!

The return trip was almost as good, but I wasn't able to be the co-pilot. Great Experience!",2018-10-06T16:45:57Z,66
131,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,This airline is always running efficiently and the staff are friendly and very helpful. They even have a free shuttle bus that drives you to your destination from Victoria harbour. Wow I wish all the other airlines could operate so smoothly. Definitely a must do if you are touring in British Columbia.,2022-08-18T01:47:11Z,66
132,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"It is a bit pricy but it is very convenient and it saves you a lot of time depending where you are going. I took the float plane from Vancouver to Victoria and it only took 35 mins. Compared to the ferry, I saved over 2 hrs. I departed from Vancouver downtown and it definitely beat taking a bus, driving or a taxi to the ferry terminal which is like at least 1 hour away from downtown. 

In terms of the flight: 
CONS
- it was very loud inside (can hear the engine loudly) but they do provide free earplugs
- Inside is somewhat run down
- Small and feel very enclosed inside
- Expensive compared to the Ferry and other options

PROS
- Convenient
- Very smooth landing because it lands on the water
- Very scenic view. It flew very low to the ground that the view was very beautiful
- Free pastries and coffee or tea to its customers

If I had to do another business trip to Victoria, I would definitely take the float plane again. 

The price of the float plane return was $414 vs the ferry return $32. For personal trips and if I am not in a rush, I will still take the ferry due to cost.",2018-05-09T05:57:00Z,66
133,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"So if you are debating doing this activity, let me encourage you to go. Yes, it isn't cheap, but the memories will last forever. I took the 20 min scenic seaplane tour of Vancouver. I was beyond nervous,  it ended up being lovely.

I bought my tickets of and was able to depart about an hour after arriving. There was a great free coffee shop in the office. When it was time to board the plane, it was simple. My purse was put in the back of plane. The plane for 6 people and everyone had a window seat. My pilot warned me that the plane would be flying low and it did. The views were out of this world. The landing was calm. No regrets about doing this plane ride. I highly suggest it to everyone!",2019-09-03T03:19:32Z,66
134,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"OUTSTANDING experience flying Harbour Air from Vancouver to Victoria for the day recently in late April.

We did an 11am flight - takes 35 minutes to get to Victoria.  The aerial sites of the all the islands below are curiously intriguing.

It is a bit on the pricey side but still very much worth the experience.
Planes only hold up to 6-8 people.  You definitely DO NOT need to splurge for the reserved seating (only like 3 seats on the left side of the plane).  The yield no better views in my opinion; they are just single seats as opposed to the double seats on the right side of the plane.  Views are just as good on the right.

Easy take off, easy landing.  Fun Fun Fun Experience!!",2019-05-01T20:50:02Z,66
135,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"Did a 20-minute seaplane visual tour of Vancouver. It was a great experience at the end of our trip to see all the places we had visited from the sky. The whole experience was very casual and easy. We checked in, grabbed a complimentary coffee from the barista, and walked around the docks outside while waiting for them to call our party. They seemed to be running behind schedule, however, and we ended up waiting about 30 minutes longer than expected for our tour. It was definitely worth the wait, however, and the employees out on the docks were kind enough to let us stick around in the ""restricted"" boarding area to take pictures with the seaplanes.",2018-08-12T23:23:27Z,66
136,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"Yes, five stars. Yes, there are still things I could complain about but in general here are the reasons for the five stars: The flights seem to be really on time when the weather is good. I totally understand that wind, fog, rain, etc, can really screw things up but let's forget about that for now. The flight over to island, wherever you are going, is really quite beautiful. If you ask you may get the co-pilot seat and of course they seem to take special preference to those who may have never been on a seaplane before. As to the seaplanes themselves -- yes, they are small, luggage could be a problem (but if it is -- take the ferry), and to my surprise being in a seaplane really felt no different then landing or taking off on land and when the water is as smooth as glass I think this might actually be a smoother experience on both landing and takeoff.

Further -- the big point of smoothness comes from this being more like private air than commercial flight. I have no idea what the domestic rules are in Canada but for a person from the US to get on a flight with a generic boarding card, off the island because their name was on a list the pilot was holding, with basically zero TSA screening hassle of any kind is pure joy. This thing might have a propeller and wings but the service feels as simple as a bus.

So, no, not much flash to the experience but a whole lot of convenience -- and if you need to make a dash to and from the island without dragging a week's supply of personal items with you this is simply awesome.",2016-10-13T14:50:04Z,66
137,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,We have always had a great time with Harbour Air. We have friends and relatives with us today and wanted them to experience their first flight on a float plane. They all had a ball and I highly recommended this for a great experience. Great planes and great service. Thanks again for such a fun time.,2017-08-19T16:16:08Z,66
138,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"We had a great time with Harbour Air. 

We booked a city tour and had a fantastic ride. My son got to sit in the Co-pilots seat and captured the whole flight on his GoPro. 
He will never forget that experience. 

Very professional crew and staff. 

Go early in the day or go the day before and make a reservation. They have limited flights and fill up quick. 

Definitely a must do",2017-06-05T17:01:10Z,66
139,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"My last review of Harbor Air, was strictly to do with actually flying somewhere.

This review is on the package express service.
I have used this service in the past, and loved it! 

Package up what it is you send ( service to and from  Vancouver to Victoria & Nanaimo )  Take it down to the Harbour ( I do believe that they do offer door to door pick up & delivery  - but I drop mine off, and have it picked up at the other end.

Other times, I went to the main terminal to ship, but it seems now, they have a specific area ( a portable trailer ) that you go to. Up the ramp, we opened the door. The space was small. Enough room for one Person at the counter, one person behind, and that's about it.

It was hot inside, lucky I didn't have to wait long. The clerk had zero personality.
However I was there to ship a package, not talk to a shrink about my problems. 
This was the only reason they lost one star. No big deal ! 

Anyway - the process was quick - my name & phone # 
The receivers name & phone #  

Package weighed, ( mine was fairly large and heavy, as it contained a large heavy hard covered coffee table book, and other ltems ) 
I was thrilled that it was only going to cost me 15.96$ with tax! 
It was going on the next flight, and would arrive same day - actually within an hour ! 

How can you beat that ??",2012-02-03T03:15:39Z,66

142,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"Worst experience of my life, avoid these people as much as you can. We felt our lives were in danger the time we were in the plane with the pilot and one of the passenger was a pilot for 40 years. 
We did complain to management and they absolutely showed no emotions. 
I sent them a video where the pilot took us within 50 feet of the mountain and sent to them and they still ignored us. My best step is to file an official complain against them. They absolutely showed no remorse and I sent them the video to them in the sense of I have ones that would scare any professional pilot. These people should not be rewarded and I will make sure that they wouldn't hurt anyone.
Will never use them.",2018-06-19T01:56:47Z,66

144,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"We booked the 3pm flight from Vancouver to Victoria. It was really rainy and foggy so there were many cancelled flights. Since they can't fly out of Vancouver, they arranged a shuttle to take the 13 passengers to Richmond for a complementary 45min bus ride.  Once in Richmond, they already had the seaplane ready for us. We all boarded the plane and were flown to Victoria within 30min. Big shout out to the brunette flight agent who arranged the shuttle and ensured we were able to get to Victoria same day! Special thanks to the very kind pilot who showed empathy and exceptional customer service! He made sure everyone was comfortable by taking our bags, got preferred seats if we paid for them, offered a passenger the copilot seat so he and his partner were not sardines, kindness and smoothly flew us over to Victoria! It's so refreshing to see a pilot who showed kindness and went above and beyond the call of duty! Thank you so much for a safe, thoughtful and wonderful experience!",2021-08-27T15:27:44Z,66
145,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"Fun tour of Vancouver for a first time visitor. For me, I would not go again. 

Email communication was a little unclear. We arrived 25 minutes before our flight (from email directions) and were told that was the time our flight was supposed to board. Then we waiting in line because they weren't ready. 

The pilot was nice and my husband and I seats next to each other. After flying in several very small planes in Africa, I thought I knew what to expect. However I'm 5'6"" and could not sit comfortably because my knees hit the seat in front of me. 

A fun experience one time. I would chose another option for anything longer than our 20 minute flight.",2018-04-01T15:31:32Z,66
146,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"So, my partner and I were in Halfmoon Bay for a few days, and decided it would be neat to take the seaplane on the way back

It helped that I had the 50% off standby rate, and that pretty much sealed the deal

We arrived into Sechelt, and made our way to the terminal

It was pretty quiet, and we didn't have any issues getting on the flight

They offered free coffee, muffins, and pastries which was a nice treat

The flight was short, but sweet. 20 minutes from Sechelt into Coal Harbour. One word to describe it would be amazing. They were only 5 of us on board including the pilot

Arrival into coal harbour was one of the most scenic and beautiful landings. Really amazing 

I'd highly recommend, especially if you have the industry discount. Give it a try",2018-06-06T04:06:27Z,66
147,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,One of the best experiences of my Summer 2017! We were taking a morning walk along the harbor (or Harbour if you're fancy/Canadian ;) and noticed the float planes taking off. We then happened to run into a woman with an iPad that worked for Harbour Air and was selling tickets. She informed us about the opportunity to take a quick flight around the Vancouver area and see the surrounding scenery. We were not disappointed. It was a beautiful day and the sights were unforgettable. I grew up in this area but still am blown away by how beautiful it is. The staff were very nice and helpful! They pilot even allowed one of us to sit in the cockpit during the whole flight! We also were offered complimentary snacks and grabbed a beer in the lounge before take off. It may seem pricey to take a scenic flight for less than an hour but I promise you it's well worth the money!,2018-03-02T00:39:31Z,66
148,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"Great experience for an avgeek. I chose to fly the mail run up to Ganges Bay and Maple Bay and back. I accidentally picked an absolutely gorgeous day to do so, and really couldn't be happier. Arrived nice and early on a cool spring morning, enjoyed a leisurely wait in the lounge. Maybe this says more about United than about Harbour, but the standard waiting area at the seaplane terminal is about as nice as a United domestic lounge - free, and most importantly, free good coffee - loved my London Fog. And free pastries - it was banana bread this morning. Very nice.

And I certainly can't complain about the flight - everything went as planned, on time, aircraft was in great condition, even got to ride up front for a couple of legs. The pilot, after commenting that something like 28 of the last 30 days had been rainy or overcast, said we were ""taking the scenic way home"". Sure, no complaints.

So, I flew Harbour as a tourist, no bags, not even a carry on, but I would be happy to fly them again if I was heading some place for real. Again, a great experience.",2017-07-16T21:42:21Z,66

Always pleasant staff, flights on time, fast check-in and boarding, free cappuccino from the Coal Harbour terminal...also float planes are just super cool.

But as of today, my favourite terminal is Comox. Both Andrew and Brian are peaches. Andrew gave me a ride to my hotel in Courtney no charge and Brian...well simply put a really nice approachable guy. After about 2 minutes we were talking about work, love, life and philosophy. Love it. They both really epitomize small town charm and hospitality. Could not have been a more pleasant experience.

151,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"The prospect of visiting Vancouver or the Gulf Islands congers up images of ferry line-ups, sailing waits, screaming children, tipsy windy seas, and crappy White Spot burgers to pass the time. 
Never again if I can help it.
That was my reality for the past 20 years until I flew over to Victoria from downtown Vancouver in about 35 minutes. Now this is the way to travel!
The quick check-in, free coffee and wifi is definitely appreciated.

What makes a trip with Harbour Air feasible for this cheap student is that they have great deals if you are willing to go standby. $75 to Victoria, $49 to Nanaimo, and $59 to the Gulf Islands. But ya gotta have a valid student card.

But what I respect most about this local company is that they were the first Carbon Neutral airline in North America.

152,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"Great way to travel from Van to the island, sure beats the BC ferries madness. 

One thing I wish I had known is if you fly standby, you have to arrive in person to get on the list. We called in, and they told us there were 2 spots on the 11:40 so we walked down at 10:30 (we live 5 minutes away). When we arrived, they told us that there was 6 people ahead of us on the standby list for those 2 seats. I found this process very unclear, and wish they had disclosed that there were 6 people ahead of us on the list. Now we will be lucky if we get on the 3....fingers crossed !

Otherwise a great way to travel, you can get from downtown Van to the inner harbour in Victoria in just over 39 minutes.",2016-03-25T18:31:34Z,66
153,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"I still enjoy the flights but was frustrated by Harbour Air's inability to articulate a policy on whether or not someone in a manual wheelchair could fly on their seaplanes. Best we could get was a No, but it wasn't very consistent. We ended up on Saltspring Air instead as a result.

In the end -- and only when I asked the question on Facebook -- did we get an answer. Though, as you can see below, it still took some prying to figure out exactly what their policy was:

-- Me: ""So Harbour Air has the largest planes in the local business and your luggage hatches could totally fit regular wheelchair chairs, yet you seem to be the only floatplane company that WON'T allow wheelchair users to fly at all. Can you explain why or clarify your policy please?""

-- Harbour Air Seaplanes: ""Thanks for asking Tod. We take many measures to provide extra service to our passengers with disabilities. Due to the unique nature of seaplane travel, we ask that our passengers who have questions about the extra help that they may require, to please give us a call to discuss the best possible travel options for them. This service is headed up by our Safety Department who can be reached at 604.233.3541.""

-- Me: ""Um okay, but you didn't quite answer the question. Can you clarify what your policy is? Do you or do you not provide service for passengers in regular (i.e., not motorized) wheelchairs?""

-- Harbour Air Seaplanes: ""Hi Tod. Yes we will accept passengers with wheelchairs, however, we do require that all persons traveling are ambulatory. We define ambulatory as being able to enter and exit the aircraft without assistance. I hope this answers your question.""",2011-09-08T06:47:37Z,66

What a beautiful day for my first seaplane trip to the Island. Metrotown - Waterfront Station - Nanaimo - Downtown - Metrotown = 4.5 hours. SWEET!!!

Free hot beverages on check in. Best views in Canada. Gorgeous towering Coal Harbour condos. Canada Place, the seawall, Lionsgate bridge, Stanley Park.  I found the check in agent to be quite efficient and attentive. The pilot asked if anyone needed a taxi when we arrived, I said ""I do, please!"" And one was waiting in Nanaimo...NICE. 

Online ticket $150 return. Convience = Priceless. Yup, BC Ferries, forget  you, I'm a seaplane girl now :P (And they have ear plugs on board in case you forget yours!)",2013-04-25T23:56:46Z,66

156,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"My sister, brother, and I decided to treat my parents and aunt for their birthdays to the Fly 'n Dine package because we thought it would be a really fun and beautiful experience. Don't get me wrong, the view of Vancouver was absolutely stunning. Photos do not do justice for what we saw. I would honestly give the flight itself a 5/5. For those who do not know, the Fly 'n Dine experience starts off with a lovely 20 minute aerial tour of Vancouver and the islands, and ends off with a dinner at the Boathouse in Horseshoe Bay. To complete the night, your party will be driven back to Waterfront in a limo. 

The service however, was abysmal. When we arrived, we were told that we would be separated to two different seaplanes (due to seating limits), which was fine by me. The pilot we went with barely gave us any instructions and didn't even tell us to follow him to the plane while we waited in the check-in area. When we boarded the plane, he muttered through the safety overview, which I thought was a very important part of the process. I found his overall demeanour to be very unprofessional and uncomfortable. 

The dinner service was one of the worst parts of this experience. This package comes with a set menu (appetizer, entree, dessert). Ontop of that, we ordered an appetizer platter to start. About 40 minutes into sitting down, our platter arrived, which was fine. The food was mediocre. However, we waited over an hour for the next course (which was supposed to be our appetizers that come with the set menu) but instead, we received our entrees. My dad was visibility upset with this. Because of this delay, our poor limo driver had to wait for us to get our food, since we were on a schedule. I noticed that other guests in the restaurant were looking around because they didn't receive their food either (the restaurant was relatively empty, so it didn't look too busy). The dessert was pretty terrible. I ordered a cake that was a giant crystallized mass (which tasted like freezer burn). 

We paid almost $2000 for this package, and I did not think it was worth it for the mediocre food and terrible service. The only worthwhile part of this trip was the flight above the city. However, I do not think I will be flying with Harbour Air again.",2015-09-20T20:56:08Z,66

They called to tell me a cancellation opened up a seat for me...I said I was coming and would be there 15 min before flight (they board 10 min before and remember, it's a seaplane, no security and all that).  I arrived 12 min before flight and they had given away my seat!  Even though they knew I was on my way AND it was not yet time to board.  Why?  ""Policy.""  ""Got to leave on time.""  Going to Salt Spring Island and they think they're United Airlines...

So my 80 year old father is waiting for me on the dock in Ganges.  I couldn't reach him in time.

Btw Sea Air calls to see if you coming if you a bit late (which I was not).  So, please go Sea Air or Salt Spring air, especially if the distinction between people and business makes any difference to you.",2015-09-19T01:36:53Z,66

This route is flown in either a single or twin otter, depending on demand/schedule, and takes you over the city to land in front the Canada Place and Convention Center. Ask an agent which routes are likely to be flown with the Beaver if you're looking for the small float plane experience.

Harbour Air's prices are reasonable and they offer exceptional flexibility (at least on the higher ticket types, permitting easy-to-make no-cost changes up to 15 minutes prior to departure).",2016-09-14T04:57:23Z,66

While it is definitely more expensive than catching the ferry, the service is incredible. From the check-in area in Coal Harbour to the waiting lounge with wifi, free coffee/tea and muffins what more can you ask for? Heck, I don't even get that service when I fly to Europe and have access to the lounges. 

The flight experience was one of the best I've ever had. As the only passenger on the flight, I was able to sit in the cockpit, listen to the air traffic controllers and chat with the pilot. The views of the Olympic mountains, the water and YVR Airport were absolutely breath taking. I felt like a little kid all over again!

You can go downtown to downtown from Vancouver to Victoria or Nanaimo in half an hour, and just have to check in half an hour before hand.

Another good thing is the restaurant attached in Victoria and Nanaimo which make for a quick and tasty lunch while you're waiting to head back.

If you think take off is exciting wait until you land in the water.  I had visions of an Indiana Jones movie except I wasn't being chased by crazy Germans. 

Harbour Air is the only way to commute to the island.",2014-03-05T16:50:22Z,66
167,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"Once and a while there are some perks to your job. One of these perks is being able to use Harbour Air when having to head over to Vancouver Island for work. This may be the more expensive option as opposed to the ferry but it is faster and just far more enjoyable! The flights to both Victoria and Nanaimo are very short but very scenic as you fly over the straight and over many of the Gulf Islands. 

If you are really lucky you might be able to sit up with the pilot and put on the headset and chat with them when they are not chatting with the control towers. There is nothing better than the view from the co-pilot seat in a float plane! 

The planes might be noisy and the ride might be bumpy but hey it is a tiny little plane what can you expect? So the next time you need to head to the island think twice before taking the ferry. This might be the best way for you to travel. As an added bonus you can take the skytrain to waterfront and walk to the terminal as it is at the West Convention Centre!

169,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"I've been using Harbour Air since 2001: South Terminal and Coal Harbour.  It's really the only way to travel to the Southern Gulf Islands if your time is worth anything.  Today, I mostly use Harbour Air to fly to S. Pender, Maple Bay, and Nanaimo; mostly the latter.

One problem with the Southern Gulf Island services is that Harbour Air won't fly in the winter if there's any chance of cloud or mist.  This can make, and has made, a return trip an absolute nightmare (Surprise! You're now driving to N. Pender, taking the ferry to Victoria, jumping on the ferry to Tsawwassen, catching the bus to Richmond, taking the train to downtown Vancouver, and catching the taxi home...after such a trip one could really use some down-time on the Gulf Islands!).  My theory is that they'll jump on any excuse to cancel flights under the guise of ""safety"" because these routes make very little money for them.

Another problem is that Harbour Air has bought out all of the competition so there are very little options out there or obstacles to their increasing fees...which segues to my next point about the increase in fares.  It's incredible that they've tacked on an additional $15 per ticket.  That increase alone is an additional $60 for my wife and I to fly return.

Harbour Air claims that they're ""carbon neutral"".  Greenwashing?  Probably.  Mind you, I truly appreciate efforts made towards this goal but hope that it isn't an exercise in marketing.  Do you know how many seedlings one would have to plant and maintain to make up for the carbon emitted in one flight?  I don't but I hope they do.  But then again, flying is one of those carbon intensive luxuries and if I wasn't such a hypocrite, I'd simply walk my ass onto the ferry.

174,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"Absolutely Love Harbour Air.....They have the very best service, the people are absolutely fantastic, smiling and truly wonderful to see.  The flights are always amazingly beautiful, fast and effective.  Thank you Harbour Air as flying with you always makes me smile!!!",2015-02-21T01:53:47Z,66
175,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"Took a last-minute flight from Vancouver to Whistler, so I ended up paying top dollar. Still, I was one of the only people on the flight so it was almost like getting a private plane to the mountains! This was one of the most incredible experiences of my life; I've been wanting to ride in a DeHavilland since I was a kid, and it absolutely lived up to my expectations! Highly recommended!!",2012-08-10T02:25:47Z,66
176,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"i recently booked the ""mail run tour"" out of vancouver for my 10-year old and myself, and we had a great time! our pilot even let my son sit in the front of the plane for the return trip to vancouver. i think he wants to be a pilot, now. 

everything was easy to book and setup over the phone. the website was a little difficult to use, since the available tours for the day i wanted to book were not viewable, but give an agent a call. ours was super informative and helped me get the most bang for my buck. 

i highly recommend harbour air sea plane tours for anyone visiting vancouver. i can't wait to take the rest of my family on a tour on our next visit to vancouver.",2014-05-24T14:09:17Z,66
177,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"I'll admit that I like the ferry, probably because I grew up away from the ocean, but I've had a few instances where I didn't have the time to go to the island by ferry. I've flown Harbour Air using the online deals they post on Facebook and Twitter, and standby with my student ID. Booking and check in have always been seamless, and from Vancouver you land right in the middle of downtown Victoria or Nanaimo so the convenience factor is huge. The only pitfall is flying in windy weather, the turbulence tosses the plane around so airsickness is bound to happen.",2012-01-05T20:10:19Z,66
178,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"Somewhere in the small print while on their website it says this price if you book on line is  $45 cheaper, buyer beware...  The terminal staff in Victoria could have been allot more helpful in this situation... Its left me with a bad taste..",2011-12-20T16:24:54Z,66

180,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"This review is in regards to the sightseeing portion of the Harbour Air Seaplanes.  First of all, we were told we were going to be on a six person plane, assuring us a great seat!  When we were boarding, we ended up in a 14 person plane, which is set up with 4 window seats on the left, and 5 double seats on the right.  Of course we ended up on the right.  The problem with this is that the flight path that the pilot took did not allow people on the right hand side of the aircraft see what the people on the left hand side of the plane saw.  Second, the pilot was unfriendly, without any commentary throughout the duration of the flight.  One of the major problems I had with the flight was the exhaust fumes.  By the time the 20 minute plane ride was finished, I had a headache.    For  $100, I think you can skip this one!",2012-08-12T02:04:53Z,66
181,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"Do yourself a favor and skip the ferry from Vancouver to Victoria and take Harbour Air. What an amazing experience! It was such a great mode of transportation and I would do it again in a heartbeat.  The planes were really great and the take off and landing was smooth as silk.   

Can't wait to do this again!",2012-06-05T04:48:20Z,66
182,Harbour Air Seaplanes,4.2,"As my job at a legal firm in downtown sometimes requires me to go over to Vancouver island, I use harbour air to save time.

I recommend them.",2014-02-02T20:11:29Z,66

He also laid out all the amex fine hotel credits. $100 for food; in room dining, and minibar. Breakfast included. Complimentary check in your luggage but gratuity based. It made planning our stay there much easier answering questions that I didn't know I needed answering yet. Will update review after we stay in June!",2024-02-19T05:01:20Z,143
185,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"We recently stayed here for getaway and parked in the garage, P2. It was very convenient because you could take an elevator to check in lobby. Due to my credit card benefit, we were able to update our room with harbor view. The staff were friendly and helpful to make our stay wonderful. They had live music from Thursdays to Sunday nights. We went to the restaurant, the Arc for breakfast and enjoyed fresh ingredients. The location was excellent because restaurants and shops are in walking distance. The check in and out process was smooth. Great experience and we will come back again.",2023-12-02T05:13:37Z,143
186,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,We recently stayed at the Fairmount Waterfront for several days before a cruise in May. We have stayed there many times in the past. We usually get a corner suite and the views are so nice. The rooms are nice spacious and well equipped and clean.  The beds were  comfortable and the employees are friendly. We also enjoy eating at the Arc restaurant in the hotel. Breakfast is free there with your room. It's super simple to go on a cruise as they will deliver your bags to the ship and you can just go walk across and board the ship. The review would have been five stars except they put us in the wrong room and didn't have a different room for us to go to. The hotel is in a perfect location for walking around and going to shops and restaurants.,2023-09-13T22:45:18Z,143
187,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,This hotel was beautiful. Room was spacious and everything was clean. The service in the hotel was great. There is a small pool on the 3rd with a bar. Most days the pool had a lot of children. There is a small gym on the same floor. Hotel also raises bees. The honey is available during breakfast. The rooms do not have a microwave. There are nice robes for use in the room. The food at the restaurant/bar downstairs food is pretty good. The hotel is in a central location. You can easily walk along the waterfront to other bars and restaurants. The hotel also has free bike rentals.,2023-08-29T00:25:04Z,143
188,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Stayed at this hotel for a week during my recent trip to Vancouver. We had a Fairmont Gold room with amazing ocean and city views. It was super luxurious with access to exclusive private Gold Lounge, personalized VIP concierge services and complimentary breakfast, snacks throughout the day, evening canapes and dessert. Various beverages (tea, espresso coffee, juices, ales, hard liquor) were available to choose from at any hour of the day. The roof top provided some of the best views Vancouver has to offer. The gym had all essential equipment to provide a full body workout with relaxing pool and city views. Definitely enjoyed the hot tub too! Amazing stay here, thank you Fairmont Gold Team for making our trip a memorable one!",2023-06-26T02:08:05Z,143
189,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"If you need to park at the hotel, head straight over to Burrard St and turn towards the water. Address is approx 200 Burrard St. From there, head down to either P2 or P3 and follow the signs for hotel parking. There should be an elevator bank near that section in the corner to take you up to the lobby.

The hotel is very busy. One of the few places since I've travelled in the past year after the loosening of covid restrictions where I have to constantly wait in line. Waiting in line for the check-in counter, waiting in line for the elevator, waiting for a space in the jacuzzi pool. Waiting seems to be the common theme here.

It has a fairly convenient location, right on the water and close to the Waterfront translink station. The staff were curteous and helpful, five stars.

I really didn't like the beds though. The mattress seems two sizes too small. I'm not really sure what happened here, but you can clearly see the box/spring underneath. Not very appealing aesthetically. Also not a big fan of the frame sticking out from under the mattress, different from other hotels and habit of walking closer to the mattress made me bump into the frame a few times. Especially with smaller kids around who can sometimes be more careless than me! Also the shower can definitely use a bit more water pressure.

Overall it's not a bad hotel, but I just expected more from a Fairmont given the price point and brand.",2022-11-30T15:37:03Z,143
190,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Absolutely ruined my brother's 50th birthday and Christmas!!!

I've tried everything to reserve my brother's birthday on my Canadian Visa Card. Turns out I can't use it as a credit card because it is a Virtual Visa Debit which they can not accept. Why didn't you tell me a few days ago when I sent it to you?? 

 This completely rude manager named Michael Zhuang accused me of fraud. 

The reason why I don't want to use my American money is my business because I have Canadian funds in Canada to use! I am not a fraud!

Shame on you for not resolving this issue and making these accusations! You didn't even try to use my Amex but labeled me which is discriminatory!

My poor brother is there ready to celebrate and you ruined his birthday and Christmas. 

Never will stay at the Fairmont Waterfront it's been a disaster. 

Fast forward Mena Naji called me back and confirmed they wouldn't have been able to process my credit card on the same day with a bunch of excuses pertaining to internal policies and procedures which sounds like a bunch of nonsense. Bottom line you don't have a great way of taking credit cards on line to accommodate. Will not take accountability nor conflict resolution strategy. Big thumbs down.",2022-12-23T20:43:06Z,143
191,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"The Fairmont Waterfront is located across the street from the Pan Pacific Hotel with it's large white iconic sails at the waterfront aka Vancouver Harbour.

This Fairmont as opposed to the very chic ultra luxurious Fairmont Pan Pacific (a block away) or the older but elegant, Fairmont Hotel Vancouver (across from the Vancouver Art Gallery), has many things going for it!

Rooms are swanky & comfy, excellent location for sightseeing & quick access point to waterfront or downtown, ARC restaurant, heated pool & hottub, friendly warm staff & Miku restaurant across the street.

Having stayed at the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel last summer, I've come to fall in love with the Fairmont brand.

Fairmont Waterfront is luxurious & although many prefer the Fairmont Pacific Rim (you'll be needing the Black Card to stay there), I recommend you stay here & save that money for the fabulous weekend brunch buffet!

See my ARC review for pix! 

A large spectacular rooftop heated pool, hottub & gym make this hotel a great place to stay!

Being at the waterfront means quick access to the seabus if you want to go over to the North Shore.

This location is great for walkers or joggers - Coal Harbour area & Stanley Park minutes away & a comfortable 15min walk over to Robson Street.

Historic Gastown is an easy 5min walk over & you're on Water Street.

If you fly into Vancouver, you can take the Canada Line train from YVR Airport straight to downtown waterfront, then wheel your luggage over - 5mins from Waterfront Station to the hotel.

Easy!

Yelpies don't hesitate to book a stay here!!!

But if you do go with Fairmont Pacific Rim, I won't be mad at ya ... I'll be jealous!",2022-01-12T06:08:04Z,143
192,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Staying at a Fairmont your expectations will always be met or exceeded. There were at least three other Fairmont locations nearby but love love this location. Central to downtown Vancouver and all the great eateries, Stanley Park, Granville Island, and so much more to explore, it was a perfect place to escape and explore Canada's winter. 

Service is impeccable here. You'll always be treated well. Note, there is no valet but if you park at Easy Park parcade across the Waterfront Centre, it's affordable and convenient. Our room 2324 offered the perfect view of the skyline and Stanley Park. The fitness and pool area is immaculate and offers great amenities so you can stay on track of fitness goals while vacationing. 

Dining at ARC is wonderful and suggest reservations during your stay. If you forego the in room coffee, plenty of coffee shops and Starbucks located nearby. Note, if you move anything in the minibar, the sensors will think you partaked. So be careful of potential charges however, the hotel will adjust any incorrect charges willingly and kindly. 

Travel is an investment in yourself. The goal is to collect memories and not just dreams. You only live once. But if you do it right, once is enough. So book a room here and go explore!",2022-01-03T15:54:38Z,143
193,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"You always know the kind of treatment you'll get at a Fairmont. Clean, professional, and often times in unique locations with a history and a story to tell.

I recently stayed here on a short trip for business. The room was extremely well appointed, great selection of in room food and drink as well as an excellent restaurant called arc. Surprisingly one of the best meals you can get at Arc is there a grilled cheese and tomato bisque.  It was probably cooked using over a pound of butter but I didn't care! Excellent.

One gripe I had, don't think it is the fault of the hotel, rather the current labour market-- is it appeared that some services fell short of regular standards due to a shortage of staff. I was lucky enough to be there with my fiancé and was disappointed when we're informed by the front desk they were unable to deliver a bottle of Prosecco around 11:30 PM.

Really excellent pool, hot tub, and fitness facility here.  Each bathroom has a eucalyptus steam room (closed for COVID).  

Overall, would recommend.  Vancouver has many Fairmont's and they are all excellent and unique in their own way.",2022-01-02T23:42:36Z,143
194,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Had the pleasure of coming here this week and really enjoyed my visit!

This one is by the waterfront, just outside of Gastown and across from the Pan Pacific.  In Vancouver, I had previously only stayed in the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver before of the Fairmonts.  This is a nicer hotel (both hotel rooms and meeting rooms).  Always nice to look at the water when you're bored at a meeting in the Louisa room :)

Service at this location is top notch and overall much better than the central downtown Fairmont.  Valet service is smooth (although I was a bit alarmed when one of the young valet guys was whipping around the corner with my car!) and food service staff are some of the best I have seen lately.  Staff are well trained here.

Food was very good - had breakfast, lunch and snacks here.  No complaints.  Herons restaurant on site is a safe dining option, and many non-hotel restos are within walking distance.

Overall, I prefer the Waterfront to the Hotel Vancouver if you're deciding between the 2 downtown Fairmonts because the rooms are nicer and service is much better here.  This one is a bit less central but an easy walk to Gastown, but a bit more a stroll or cab ride to other parts of downtown.

An extra bonus is that the Canada Line has a stop just outside the front door, so very convenient if you're coming from the airport.",2009-10-04T15:21:00Z,143

196,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"My Husband and I stayed 1 night at the Fairmont Waterfront for our 1 yr Anniversary in January this year. Although an older hotel, the room we stayed in facing the harbour was modern. They had champagne etc ready for us after coming back from a nice Italian dinner our first night there. Service was good! Our stay included a breakfast buffet in the morning, but we seemed to miss it by a couple minutes. The staff was very accomodating and allowed us to order from the menu instead, even though breakfast was over. A Seahawk game was on, and of course the Hubs had to watch it. They were kind enough to change the channel from hockey to football. Hockey is popular in BC i learned.

We love going to Vancouver for shopping and trying out new restaurants! I just wish restaurants knew about french press.. I asked about 3 restaurants if they had it available, but no luck! lol. It's always worth a try iguess!",2011-05-01T01:25:45Z,143
197,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,Excellent and the breakfast at Arc was fantastic. They were very accomdating to my son with an allergy and I greatly appreciated the service.,2016-07-18T23:17:51Z,143
198,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,This was my first time staying at a Fairmont (besides the airport hotels) and I absolutely loved it. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We stayed on the higher floors and found the view to be amazing (we were facing toward Canada Place). The hotel was very quiet and very little noise. There was a lot of perks to stay at this hotel as there the staff gave bottled water and towels out after our morning runs. There is also free flavoured and non flavoured water in the lobby. The hotel was super modern with a great lifestyle feel. I would strongly recommend staying at this Fairmont!,2017-08-25T03:43:28Z,143
199,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"The Fairmont Waterfront is not as nice as the Fairmont Pacific Rim, that being said, in my limited hotel travels, the Pacific Rim was the best hotel I've ever staying in, so the competition was stiff. Still great service. And, let's be honest, a better price than the Pacific Rim. The rooms have a modern look, and everything was clean. It's like the younger sister to the Pacific Rim. Looks good on it's own, but when compared to the older sister it seems... lacking a certain sophistication.

(I could easily have reversed the age example, but being the oldest sibling, I'm sticking to the fact that older is better!)",2011-02-11T16:17:34Z,143
200,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"We stayed here with two Dads and two boys. When we checked in, the front desk gave us free ""milk and cookies"" delivered to the room by room service. The boys loved this and they said the cookies were delicious. 
The view is great, but how long can you look at a foggy filled harbor filled with transport ships. The kids seemed to find something new to look at out there all the time though. Constant ferries and the odd helicopter was worth a glance. 
The room was absolutely silent. We never heard a thing through out the night and the beds were very comfortable. 
The gym is OK, stepper, elliptical and free weights but only up to 50 lbs. The pool is good. There was no slide or anything, just a pool and a hot tub. The pool is outside which is kind of cool. 
We enjoyed the breakfast buffet and everyone ordered from the ""Egg chef"".  The food was good and the selection was nice.  At least a little fresh fruit and almost every kind of bread or muffin you would want.  The staff was pleasant and attentive.  The room service menu is a little poor but the service and presentation almost earn the $4.50 delivery charge and 17% automatic gratuity.  Not sure the room is worth 299 plus tax but I guess this is downtown... 
Probably only stay here again if I have business in the area. Not at par with other Fairmont Hotels.",2008-11-28T01:33:51Z,143
201,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Disney Cruise Lines arranged for us to stay at this hotel, after our week long Alaska Cruise. Absolutely fantastic place to stay. Right smack In the center of everything. Shopping center under the hotel, water taxi, train, great 24 hour tour bus pass, Chinatown all within walking distance. Coffee shops every where. There was a Fedex in the hotel. For $50 we mailed our clothes to the US so we wouldn't exceed the airline baggage weight limit. 

Great place to relax and decompress from the cruise line that had tiny bathrooms and fiberglass toilets. The hotel has wifi for $12 but get the high speed for $25. We watched Canadian expanded Netflix and I backed up my iPhone videos to my Adrive account and cleaned up my iPhone storage.

The only problem we had was that the outdoor pool heater was broken. It was supposed to be heated to 86 degrees but was very cold for our night swim. There was a great indoor jacuzzi that was heated.

They gave us a room right across from the elevator! How cool was that. Very clean room, great towels and a Fairmont monogrammed bathrobe. I think the Cruise Line got us the royal treatment. 

My advice, stay there.",2014-08-20T20:49:55Z,143
202,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"We have stayed at a number of Fairmonts over the years.  From a service standpoint, this was one of the best.  All the staff were outstanding, friendly, responsive, and helpful.  We were fortunate enough to have a suite on this trip, so absolutely no complaints about the room (with a beautiful view of Stanley Park).  Good location for access to the cruise ship terminal, Stanley Park, Gastown, etc.  Only one glitch -- the WiFi access was flaky our entire trip, across multiple laptops and cell phones.  This is somewhat bothersome since we were U.S. smartphone users in Canada (no unlimited data), but hardly a deal-breaker.",2011-07-20T16:37:42Z,143
203,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,Great hotel and great location especially if you're taking a cruise. Our room was on the 23rd floor with an incredible view of the harbor. The breakfast was lavish and the service was fantastic. Highly recommended.,2014-08-16T17:34:08Z,143
204,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"We have stayed at other Fairmonts in the past so we had high expectations, so this experience unfortunately fell a bit short for us. 

Pros:
- Comfortable bed, firm(ish) mattress
- Friendly service from the concierge, bellhops, and doormen
- Good amenities at the health club (plenty of towels, slippers (if you get there early), hair dryer, nail care, combs, body lotion, shave kit, tampons/pads, hair spray)

Cons:
- The rooms are a bit dated and need some updating - there is quite a bit of wear and tear on the countertops and carpet. 
- The room walls are very thin, we could hear everything in the hallway and the rooms next to us and above us (conversations, taking showers, running, etc.) 
- There were some cleanliness issues with our room (cobwebs on the ceiling) 
- Large standup shower however, it was equipped with a small rain shower head that did not provide adequate coverage
- The hot tub area needs some major updating - the film on the windows were peeling and chipped tiles. The overall ambiance of the hot tub area isn't very relaxing. 
- The steam rooms need some major updating - the tiles are chipping, there seemed to be some growth on the tile, strange smell, and it would take at least 10 minutes for the steam cycle to start-up. The start-up of the steam cycle was also very noisy and clunky. 
- Replenishment of the health club flavoured water sat empty from the afternoon until the end of the night (we went around 4pm and again at 9pm). 
- Very long queue for the elevators during check-out. We waited for 10 minutes as several elevators full of people opened and closed. Luckily, one of the workers on the floor noticed this and graciously offered to take us via the service elevator instead. THANK YOU",2023-01-09T23:34:36Z,143

Only brunch was good. 
So many issues with this place once i left. 

They said they would honor my Amex travel deal but they never did, charged me for something that i should haven't been. 

The pool was a mess with first come first serve with tons of kids jumping and splashing pool water in your wine glasses. Pool bartender needed so much help it took over 45 mins every time there was a drink needed.

The room was ok not an upgrade as they said, very outdated. The other fairmont was much much nicer.",2021-08-31T23:39:25Z,143

The staff was very professional and kind. We were treated to high-end coffee, canapés, desserts, beverages, breakfast, and much more. Our room was on the 8th floor and the views of the water were spectacular. We especially enjoyed watching the sun come up over the water in the mornings. This hotel is very close to Stanley Park and within walking distance of so many restaurants and downtown sights. This hotel also has a heated pool and jacuzzi which were clean and had great views.

209,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"As American Express card holders my husband and I like to stay at their ""Fine Hotels"" if we can. The added perks really make it worth it. We stayed at The Fairmont in Hawaii and really enjoyed it so we wanted to give it a shot in Canada.

Walking in is so grandeur. The place is magnificent. The front desk was so nice and helpful during our Check-In process. We were upgraded to a BEAUTIFUL corner room with windows galore! 

I also enjoy the small touches here. Like the flavored waters and teas in the lobby. They had this in the Hawaii one as well. Very nice because I am always thirsty.

We used the Concierge here often. They helped us find great food options, and told us many different things we could do in the city during our stay. They even helped us gat a cab SINCE THERES NO UBER IN CANADA! What!! I don't remember the last time I took a Taxi! Haha

We ended up using our $100 dining credit to have the one of the most memorable dinners together at the Arc restaurant. The food there is DEFINITELY worth the price! 

We had a fantastic time here and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Vancouver. You are close to just about everything!",2020-01-25T14:52:38Z,143
210,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Was in town for an overnight stay, this hotel was very convenient for us as we would be right across the way at Canada Place. We got there early before normal check-in time, unfortunately they didn't have our room ready just yet but could upgrade us to fancier room with view and all this other stuff....appreciate it but nah, we can wait. They will text you when your room is ready. Bellman was super helpful with holding your luggage until you check-in.

We walked around downtown, went to lunch, did some shopping, the hotel texted us earlier than we thought so since we were out & about, we didn't even check-in until late afternoon/early evening. Our luggage was already delivered to our room, what a bunch of sweethearts! After officially checking-in, we headed to the pool, it's a nice looking view, ok amount of chairs, it was pretty crowded up there and skin everywhere. We didn't check out the garden and bee farm, we didn't realize there was one until later. 

The room is nice, king sized bed for all kinds of activities, very comfy, nice soft sheets, plenty of room, nice big TV, great view, above average bathroom and shower was nice, no issues with the room and I sawed some logs when I fell asleep, didn't hear any hallway noise or any other amorous neighboring tourist next door. 

WiFi isn't free, but once you are connected, you are good to go. The hotel has a complimentary fancy car to give you a ride, but their radius is a little limited and we couldn't get a ride to the train station the next morning. 

Overall, we had a nice stay, staff was friendly and helpful, good location for us and glad we stayed.",2019-08-30T14:18:54Z,143
211,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"We actually stayed here the September pre-COVID before our Alaska cruise.  It cost a bit more (I did book using points), but our whole family (4 rooms total) enjoyed it. It's a nice hotel, very clean and things felt new.  Our kids enjoyed the pool quiet a bit, and there was plenty of seating area for the adults who didn't swim.  The little cafe downstairs had good food if we didn't want to venture far, or if we wanted to walk a bit we were able to get to things easily.

The bar downstairs was actually awesome so our kids could stay together in one of the rooms to hang out, and the adults were just downstairs for drinks and music.  The bar was also decently full, but you could find a seat (again, pre-COVID) so I found it to be a fun environment. 

On the day we boarded our cruise ship, it was raining just a tad, but it was very easy for each person (grandparents down to kids 7 and up) to roll our own suitcases on the short walk over to the port to get checked in.  If I'm cruising out of Vancouver again, I'd look into staying here again.",2021-04-13T18:46:59Z,143
212,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"I was greeted by a very swell gentleman who helped check me in when the other two ladies were a bit occupied. He gave me a very warm feeling welcoming me into Fairmont, even though I must look like a mess just waking up from a sleep during a short tour from Squamish earlier. 

My room was on fifth floor and the view was stunning. I was almost as high as the red ship yard crane from a distance. Throughout the stay I just let myself immerse into the city night sky and did not draw the thick curtain. I was afraid that I would not see it again after tomorrow. The room was wide and spacious, everything was well design and integrated into a lovely experience. The sockets and plugs were hidden at the end of the desk, it was an interesting find. The TV was the right size in front of the viewing angle when you lied down in bed.

I did wish I got a bathtub but a shower instead. Still, the adequately wide shower head above killed all my tiredness and refreshing. The bed was quite high due to layers. Because of these layers, the bed was made for a king, superb comforting. 

Express check-in and check-out online were available, suited me catch up with sky train in a hurry when time flew. 

I managed to go to the 3rd floor for a quick swim in the next morning. Pool was warm and the Jacuzzi had my love. Fun experience.",2021-10-31T08:09:31Z,143
213,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Best hotel experience of my life.
Super comfortable bed and bedding, raindrop shower and an amazing view. The location right in the heart of the downtown waterfront is ideal for being within walking (or biking) distance from Stanley Park, Gas Town, Chinatown, Canada Place and wonderful shopping and eating destinations.

The staff was discreet and unobtrusive. I felt like I moved in and belonged there. Our room was spotless and little unseen fairies came and did an evening turn down service while we were out exploring each day.

We were part of a large group but felt like we got individual attention. The catered meals in the banquet room were delicious. Great experience with the waitstaff. We especially loved the tea and pastry selection offered.",2019-07-10T20:42:54Z,143
214,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"This Fairmont is ok..it's not as historic ( aka old ) like the Fairmount Hotel Vancouver, or as hip/trendy like Fairmont Pacific Rim or as new as the Fairmont YVR. But there really isn't much to complain ( or really rave ) about. 

It's conveniently located across from the Convention Center Downtown, and some rooms have water views. 

It's always super clean, and rooms well lit. Rooms have plush robes and nice Rose 31 toiletries. They also have a mini bar which certainly can come in handy ! 

The beds are very comfy ( as in all the Fairmount's I've stayed at ). The staff is always pleasant to deal with. 

You do need a keycard to access the floors in the evenings ( In case you are expecting a guest, call down to leave them a room key at the front desk )",2018-01-23T05:00:15Z,143
215,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Spectacular hotel right downtown Vancouver near the water. 

The lobby welcomes you with several types of water flavored with citrus fruits and other ingredients. It is a thoughtful way to greet guests especially after travelling to get there. 

The front desk employees were exceptionally nice and provided recommendations of where to eat and what to do in downtown Vancouver. 

The hotel is gorgeous with modern furniture, decor and amenities. The rooms are immaculate, spacious with incredible views of the city. 

Room service and housekeeping were excellent. Hands down this hotel is supreme. I look forward to coming back here again and again.

217,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"If you're conflicted with where to stay in Downtown Vancouver... look no further.

Do you remember those special hotel stays you'll never forget? Well, imagine how good it must be if you're there only one night!

I had the pleasure of staying at the Fairmont Waterfront with my father for just one night before a cruise. 

Some might pick this hotel solely based on it's location to the cruise port. It is directly across the street. 

But the Fairmont Waterfront excels beyond other Five Star hotels in the city because of its people, accommodations and impeccable service standards.

When I stay at any Fairmont, I always get the Gold Level room. This is like a small hotel inside a hotel.

Our room wasn't quite ready, so we relaxed in the Fairmont Gold lounge. They have a gorgeous setup throughout the day. Breakfast, canapés and a dessert bar. 

The lounge here is on the smaller side, but they have a stunning outdoor patio that overlooks the cruise port and downtown.

The also have an honor bar so this is the perfect place to enjoy a cocktail and a small bite.

Rooms are beautiful and include any luxury amenity you can imagine. Their beds are sumptuous and the hotel has a nice turn down service, which is long gone from other hotels.

If you're cruising, the hotel will come and take your bags and they magically appear at your door on the ship. This is complementary and a luxury worth the stay.

So, what made my stay so special? 

When you have a Gold level room, you also have a dedicated Gold level team that will craft your stay while here.

I had the pleasure of interacting with Risa and Malia. Wow... they will make anything happen. Always with a smile and laser focused on every detail. 

Fairmont and their employees are the reason I wouldn't stay anywhere else when I have the option.

I can't say enough about how they deliver.",2019-09-28T22:34:17Z,143

The room was spacious with all the comforts and the view was awesome!  Amenities (hot tub, gym) were great.  Staff have smiles on their faces.  If service is this good, I wonder what it's like with Fairmont Gold? ;)

Highly recommended if you are looking for a hotel in the waterfront area.  Location is close to skytrain and gas town.",2019-10-27T22:24:48Z,143

The lobby gentlemen are great and friendly help me to print out my COVID result sheets and the ladies are nice to me. If you have a happier and connect with people here, you won't feel anything wrong or not satisfied during vacation, the best experience was the guy housekeeper worked 9 pm he came to give me water bottles, slippers and toothbrush, and in-dining room waiter is so friendly and nice.

221,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Reading the other reviews, I was prepared to love my stay at the Fairmont Waterfront, but I did not. I stayed here because it's right across the street from the cruise terminal. Off the ship at 7:30am I knew my room wouldn't be ready, so I checked my bags and stopped at the desk to ask them to let me know when my room was available. They said they would text me. 

Then over to the concierge desk to see if I could get a tour of some kind to pass the time. They said they make some phone calls to see what was available. 

So I went to the restaurant for breakfast, which was pricy but ok. Then back to the concierge desk, and they hadn't gotten around to checking for me. I said I'd sit in the lobby for a while. After an hour, back to concierge and they still hadn't called. So I stood there and they finally called and found out the tours I was interested in were sold out. I did book a Harbor cruise, but the hotel valet parking desk said no transportation was available, but they could call me a cab.

So now I'm into big money for a tour I wasn't that interested in. I later found out there was a shuttle I could have taken that had a stop a half block away, but neither the concierge or parking guy never mentioned it.

So with one thing and another I frittered away the day, checking for texts to see if my room was ready. No texts. Finally I got back to the hotel about 5:30, and the front desk told me, ""oh, your room became available while you were having breakfast. We thought you knew."" Silly me, I guess.

So check at the bell station and no they hadn't taken my bags to my room. Silly me, I guess. So get into my room, finally, and there's water and snacks available for purchase and there's a charge for wi-fi, Jeez, at a holiday inn express I get free bottled water and wi-fi. But at a four star hotel, nothing's free. Silly me, I guess.

Finally, next morning I get charged the cost of a steak dinner for a buffet breakfast! And when I ask for a shuttle to the air port, I'm told there is none, but they will call me a cab. Jeez, at the Wyndham I stayed at when I started the cruise, they had a shuttle that had stops at the airport and a few downtown locations. But at a four star hotel, nope. Silly me, I guess.

So in summary, I thought this hotel was expensive and terrible. I'll be returning to Vancouver for future cruises, but I'll definitely be looking for a different hotel.",2018-05-28T18:07:53Z,143

Washrooms are around the corner of the the conference rooms.

Tyler has been awesome. He helped us with our bike rental and when my husband got food poisoning :( (not from the Fairmont) he offered to drive me to the pharmacy. 

The cocktails at the bar were very good and the bartender was super nice.

225,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Service here is practically as good as it gets, rooms are clean, definitely felt pampered on the Gold Level. The hotel has a reputation for excellent service and they delivered. I also received great sightseeing tips from the Concierge prior arriving on our first trip to Vancouver which we planned at the spur of the moment.

Although the location is convenient to much in the city including Stanley park, Capillano shuttle, a block from the train station, Gastown, and a half hour walk from Granville Market. The hotel is located on a busy corner right across from Canada place with lots of traffic and exhaust you can smell from busses and traffic when sitting on the Gold lounge deck or 3rd floor outdoor pool deck-so much for breathing fresh air.  I was so excited the gold lounge had an outdoor deck, but it did not have the charm as some of the other Fairmont waterfront properties like the Empress.  Once I got over that, I enjoyed it for what it was. We also stayed in the Waterfront side which was a bit noisy with a generator type noise, maybe due to being near the underground train.

Join the Fairmont Presidents Club which is free and have access to bikes which can be taken out to ride around Stanley Park etc.

Overall I was pleased to stay here and would visit again.",2017-11-17T07:08:24Z,143
226,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"This is probably THE best hotel stay I've experienced in my whole life. The fact that it's in Vancouver is an ""unfair"" advantage because I'm so impressed by Canadian hospitality. I was here for a week attending a conference at the convention center. This downtown area is central to many great restaurants, bars, and tourist adventures. This area of Vancouver is generally small, to the point where I walked miles to Stanley Park and back one day.

Anyways, back to the hotel. The Fairmont is such a fantastic, high-class brand. The rooms are clean and modern... part of me wanted to lay in bed all day and NOT go to the event. But there was so much to see around Vancouver, I couldn't waste the precious week I was here. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to experience the pool area... I need to make it a habit to bring my swim suit with me on every trip. I did, however, hang out at The Arc, which is the hotel bar and restaurant. Delicious food and drinks, which I'll rave about in a separate review.

While I'm not part of the Fairmont Presidents Club, I read about some great perks of that membership. Someday I'll be fancy enough to join. There's a special lounge and everything. Regardless, the superb service extends to all its guests, not just VIPs. Well I suppose you could say they make everyone feel like a VIP. It's always nice to get tired from attending an event or sightseeing, then look forward to coming back to the hotel, not just for the comfy bed, but for the classy community it fosters.",2017-11-19T16:00:45Z,143

The view was beautiful and everything was SO clean and things felt very new.  There was so much hot water. It never ran out! That's something that usually hotels are not so great about. It was great that we were able to bring our dogs.

The food was REALLY REALLY good. Loved the chana masala, great desserts. I was especially happy there were a lot of vegetarian options, but overall I thought the menu could be bigger. Especially the kids' menu. The veggie burgers were really good, but that was really the only thing my son would eat. Our kids are vegetarian, but like most kids, they're picky so the grilled cheese was ""too fancy!"" Overall the food was tasty, fresh and really good.

The rooms are spacious and the tub is huge. They have nice amenities in the bathroom, along with the TV in the bathroom. It's in the mirror. 

The drinks at the ARC restaurant in the lobby are very refreshing. New take on old drinks. They have a garden on site where the use some of the things for fresh ingredients in their drinks.

230,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Dear Mr. Flores

We just came down from staying at Fairmont Chatue/Whistler which was unbelievable with customer service and extremely pleasant wonderful experience. 

We are a family of 3 young kids plus my mother, (6 total) we were so happy and loving Canada until we arrived here at Fairmont WaterFront.

The lady at check in was pleasant her name was Victoria and it said trainee on her badge. She obviously was new and inexperienced. We were checking in at 6:15 pm.

I asked if there were any upgrades available and she said let  me check. After 25 min of waiting patiently her colleuge a young gentlemen tried to help her. ( they kept saying thank you for your patience as they realized it was taking a very long time)

They said we have the same room available just higher better views with breakfast and executive lounge access for $70/CAD/night. 

He then said "" it's the same room just with better views of the Port and Breakfast"" so I said sure why not better views of Port for my kids.

Now this is 45min into check in....I went up to room 803 which was on the elevator and the doors closed....then they said you have 802 and we will open door. Another 20 min wait with little kids. 

Then the housekeeper tells me no you have just double double beds with couch area. 

I go back downstairs this is now an hour into. Check in.

I ask to speak to GM. I see the young gentleman disappear into a room where the older man is just sitting. Another 10 min wait while I'm standing in the lobby. 

Then he comes out Craig Smith....without any apologies he proceeded to tell me they explained the diff room that it was different and no king room. And if I want a king bed then I should pay for another room. ( I assure you at check in they said same rooms just better views)  His tone of  voice was pompous, arrogant, belligerent and unapologetic at all. I am in tears this has been the WORSE check in I've ever experienced and we have traveled the world including numerous stays at Fairmont resorts. 

Instead of making the evening better he made it worse. Making me wait another 10 min for new keys to original rooms when I came down there wasn't even a rollaway bed in both rooms. It is now almost 8 pm. 

We were on such a high with our family experiencing Canada and raving about all the people at Whistler Fairmont, your guest relations manager has completely ruined it for me. I am so insulted and disgusted by his behavior. 

I am reporting this to your head customer service, TripAdvisor and Google reviews. 

Mortified,",2018-04-08T15:08:53Z,143
231,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Such a lovely stay.

I always enjoy a Fairmont stay. Do you drive an EV? You get FREE valet parking. You read that right. Free parking, for EVs! 

The water in the cucumber and orange water in the lobby is a perfect touch after you've been walking around the city the whole day. It's all the little things about this hotel. The soaps, shower gel. Such a pleasant smell. Great staff. Always do pleasant. 

For a perfect appetizer and happy hour head down to the Arc bar and visit Frank. He'll set you up in style! We had a wonderful set of appetizers, champagne (it was my Birthday!) and cocktails. Then we set off into the city for the evening for entertainment and dinner. But it was the perfect way to start the evening. Greatness definitely got started there.

The location is perfect with direct access to waterfront station so it is super convenient. The lobby is understated yet luxurious. Great service every time too.

The rooms are modern and spacious. My favourite are the corner rooms - you get awesome views of the harbour and the city! There are floor-to-ceiling windows and two sets of curtains so you can control how much light you want coming into the room.

The only reason for detracting a star is the bathrooms, specifically the bathtubs. They're definitely from an older era and not very deep. If they revamped the bathtubs here, it would be a 5-star place for sure!

I love ARC restaurant and would recommend a visit if you're staying here (I have a review about it on here somewhere). Room service is very good too - consistently good dishes with nice presentation and fast service!

In terms of scene, it's like the self-assured older cousin to the Pac Rim's flashy adolescent crowd. I much prefer the type of people who stay here.

Weather-permitting, the pool is nice and unique. You enter the Fitness Center, and the hot tub and pool are connected. The pool is outside. It's downtown so it's surrounded by tall buildings, and you get a glimpse of the harbour. Fairmonts are very family-friendly, so expect children running around and splashing. There is an attendant who can get you drinks and pool food. What really impressed me was that they had sunscreen and chilled little towels provided nearby in the Fitness Center. The hot tub is inside, and has two strong jets. The hot tub is also open 24 hours.

In the room, they have a Kurig machine and mini bar. At night they provide you with little bottles of water that you don't have to pay for. The wifi is included, but it was spotty around 10am when everyone is waking up and reading their email/the news on their phone.

And there are several great sitting areas here.  Nice lobby to see all the action, and the restaurant Arc on the right.  Looks and feels expensive, but the real reason for me not trying is not a fan of hotel restaurants lol.  But I digress.

I was only in the city for twenty-four hours so I don't know Vancouver well, but it seemed to be walkable to a lot of downtown, and was conveniently located on top of an underground mall as well.  Wi-fi is free, which is another plus if you don't know where you want to go to dinner or need Google maps but are from the U.S. don't want to pay for international data on your phone.

Four stars instead of five stars because of the price.  My credit card bill is going to hurt.",2011-06-28T19:35:26Z,143

252,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Was here for the TED Conference which was amazing. In spite of TED being an invitation only event and having to ante up ten grand to attend, it is extremely interesting if you find an almost exclusive Caucasian billionaire male attendees list exciting, (yep, they gotta look at their gender and inclusion challenges a bit more seriously). But in spite of all that, TED always gets Larry's brain rebooted and challenges some of his perceptions and biases. Where was I... oh yes, the Fairmont. Sorry about that. It is located adjacent to the Conference Center and makes it very convenient for TED attendees. For some reason unfathomable to Big Larry, we received an upgrade to a VIP room which was a corner space with a great view of the waterfront and a nice big bathroom. The Fairmont is a well coiffed lady who is showing some signs of being ridden hard and put away wet. Nothing too serious, but there was some paint peeling in the bathroom - I mean how hard is that to remedy, folks? The elevator doors made opening and closing sounds that led Larry surmise they may have been steam powered and a few lights on the call board inside the elevators did not illuminate, a dissatisfaction factor as everyone who stays there uses the elevator so you'd think they would keep that space at least spic and span. One Larry gripe that had a high hide chappage factor was that they did not have a fridge. Grrr. Instead they had one of those electronically controlled mini bars that charge you if you move an item and are usually ramped up to a sensitivity that detects a mosquito landing on a beer bottle and invokes a room charge. I hate those things. Would have given four stars but the weekend arrived. The weekend staff is the second string team for sure. Didn't replace used glasses or coffee cups and did not replenish the coffee which usually starts a serious rampage as Big Larry NEEDS his coffee. Boo. Having to call for some is a huge miss for a four star hotel that the Fairmont purports to be. 

Concierge was outstanding and extremely knowledgeable about Vancouver, its environs and the restaurants with enuf pull to get reservations at trendy places that were in high demand. Good Job - no TEDaches in this area. Didn't eat in the restaurant or order room service as there was a food court accessible via hotel elevators which opened early and had a S'bucks and a Tim Hortons plus a McDonald's and a couple of other breakfast places plus a newsstand and a shoe repair and cleaners. Woo hoo. Vittles and services in the bottom of the hotel that didn't sport hotel prices. Sweeeet. Hotel had no paper delivery BTW. 

In the end, it was just a place to sleep near TED. Don't expect the height of luxury and prepare for some sadly missing maintenance. Central location is a plus, though.",2018-04-16T23:32:27Z,143

255,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"While this is probably not the finest Fairmont in the catalog, thanks to its location and age, it is perhaps the best deal.

On a last minute Expedia deal, this hotel is an upscale budget option.  Fantastic comfy beds with great linens and down comforters (a double through, means smaller double beds, meh), large spa and outdoor pool, white fluffy robes with the Fairmont insignia, and Le Labo Rose 31 bath products (heck yeah!) make this a great option in Vancouver.  Location is right on the Waterfront, adjacent and easy walking distance to Gastown, so Gastown at your fingertips, but in a slightly nicer neighborhood.

This is a faded rose, but hey, its a La Labo Rose 31, so I can absolutely deal.  Tips: join the Fairmont President's Club for free online before you go or pay ridiculous fees for your daily wifi connection, and whatever you do, do not park at the hotel.  At $44 a night, your parking costs will increase your overall costs considerably, particularly since there are about half a dozen overnight self-park parking lots within walking distance at anywhere from $20 to $10 a day (and some $4 on the weekends, even!) and many of these have unlimited in and outs.",2012-05-27T02:50:49Z,143

259,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Update review:
After posting the bad review below, a rep from the hotel sent me an email thanking me for my feedback on yelp, and then refunded me parking during my stay, a $44 value. No benefit to me, because it was a business trip charged to my client, but I am grateful of the effort. It's nice to know that they check yelp for bad reviews and still try to solve them. I can't say if the toilet, elevators or coffee pot were ever fixed, but a few good things remain, friendly,caring staff and a great view of Vancouver. So I'll add a star for the effort. 

*** 

Bad review! The view was nice and staff 
friendly but... Here's a open letter I sent to the manager (she offered an upgrade next time, even though I'm not planning on returning to Van, BC)

I can't remember what room I was in but it was on the 14th floor. The toilet did not flush, even when I held it down. It would take about three flushes before it worked. 

The coffee pot did not brew. 

I was a bit upset that someone came in to my room and closed my drapes without my permission, while I was out. 

My coworker was on the 21st floor, but I did not have access to use the elevator to go up. So I had him come down instead. I don't understand why I can't have access to his floor but he could have access to my floor. 

When I arrived initially, I parked in the self parking garage. I had a lot of gear about 4 pieces of luggage. I took the elevator up to the mall, walked to the hotel entrance, but the elevators won't open without a key card. So I used the courtesy phone to call for help. They said I could take the escalator. I explained that I could not, because of all my gear, so they said they would send a bell boy. It took him about 15 minutes to help me, too long in my opinion. But he was helpful and friendly. The whole staff was, but I expect the toilet, elevators and coffee pot to work at a world class hotel like the Fairmont. I'm staying at the Travel-lodge tonight at the Vancouver airport, and I could give this place a much better review.  

Having said all of this, the view at your hotel is great, and your staff is friendly. I guess it's all the luck of the draw.",2014-03-04T22:44:28Z,143

The room was clean and had an amazing view of the harbour.  I didn't have time to check out the amenities such as the pool, bee hives or the herb garden.  The location is good proximity to shopping on Robson, SkyTrain access and of course exploring Gastown.   I would definitely stay here again.",2019-02-09T20:11:32Z,143

The Waterfront view is spectacular and also a nice backdrop for an in-room dining experience.  The ARC is the in-house restaurant and their burnt honey ice cream is delicious.

As far as extra pampering, the gym is nice, but I especially enjoyed their whirlpool and rooftop pool.  The toiletries are also really nice hippy stuff and they refill it daily.  Towels are nice and fluffy too.  

From a business perspective, I loved the desk with the media center.  In retrospect, I should have brought my Chromecast.  Lots of outlets, which I think is really important because I hate having to unplug a lamp to plug my laptop in.",2015-08-20T20:12:31Z,143

The restaurant was good and busy.  They try to use ingredients from their garden which is a nice touch.  The garden and the pool are a wonderful spot to relax.  

The staff were all wonderful and friendly.  Feel free to exchange USD for CAD as needed.  They even do that without any service charges.  Then take the CAD and head downstairs to the food court if you need some food on the cheap.  

If you are here for a Disney Cruise they will take your luggage to the ship, that may have been the best part of the stay.

268,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"My family (3 adults) recently spent four nights at this hotel on our second trip to Vancouver. We had a West Coast Suite with Gold Lounge privileges. The two reasons we selected this hotel were the location and the reviews, which were spot on. All in all our stay was perfect and a few minor issues were handled promptly and to our satisfaction. The hotel is a buzz of activity throughout the day with a combination of business travelers, tourists, guests going on tours and others on cruises. The concierge desk was always brimming with activity as the concierge team was working with guests. They were very helpful to us. The valet staff were great and very hard working. All of the hotel staff were professional, outgoing, helpful and went out of their way to be of assistance. Housekeeping did a very good job cleaning our room each day and replenishing linens and supplies. 

Our room was beautiful, with a lovely view and the perfect size for a family. The bathroom was a good size with a walk in shower, which we prefer. We also enjoyed seeing the hotel gardens, as well as the beehives.

The Gold Lounge had a wonderful ambiance with comfortable seating and gorgeous views, as well as an outdoor patio area. The food offerings at breakfast were wonderful - just about everything a person would want. Our only issue was that the eggs and meat offerings were not hot and on a couple of mornings were cold. The nighttime canapés and various cheeses were delicious. The Gold Lounge staff could not have been more accommodating. It was very enjoyable and we were glad we selected this option. We had lunch at the hotel restaurant and it was delicious. The service was very attentive.

The location can't be beat - steps away from the Canada Line that took us to and from the airport, across the street from the cruise terminal where we were able to see a few ships arrive and depart. The hotel is also across from Canada Place and the Convention Center. Two evenings we took the house car to dinner, which was so convenient and a very nice amenity.

We had a fantastic stay in downtown Vancouver at this hotel. When we return to Vancouver for the third time, this is the hotel we will be staying at. We highly recommend the Fairmont Waterfront.",2015-09-14T22:38:09Z,143

279,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"I bought a night at the Fairmont Waterfront through Groupon. It was fun to leave work and play tourist for the night. My feelings about this Fairmont is mixed. 

When I checked in, I showed the receptionist my Groupon on my phone via the Groupon app, which is supposed to save you from having to print out Groupons. She told me that they needed a print out and suggested that I email her a copy of the receipt. I ended up having to get on my laptop in the lobby, which wasn't a huge deal except for the fact that they charge something like $15 for wifi. Fortunately, I had a Fairmont gold membership (sign up, it's free!) so I didn't have to pay for the wifi. I would have been pretty bitter if I had to shell out $15 just to use my Groupon, so I am glad it all worked out. (2 stars)

Other than that, the customer service is really great. My wife wanted to go swimming but forgot her suit so we inquired about buying one at the front desk. The manager came out and took us to the gym to see their selection. She was very patient as my wife tried to decide, and ultimately declined the suits. I went swimming without her in the heated pool at night and it was fun to see the downtown buildings lit up. (5 stars)

The rooms are a bit on the older side. I upgraded us to a water view, but wouldn't necessarily recommend this because it had us facing the convention centre, which has a large, flashing TV screen going all night long. Also, the phone in our room didn't work. (2 stars)

As we checked out, the woman at the front desk asked what our Thanksgiving plans were. I said we didn't have any and she gave me a coupon for a free bottle of wine at their restaurant. I thought this was a nice touch. (5 stars)

Overall, I give Fairmont Waterfront 3.5 stars. I'll go ahead and round up since I got a good deal on the room.",2010-11-10T02:55:44Z,143
280,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"The first nights of ""Parental Anniversary Trip 2008"" were spent here.  

The Fairmont Watefront is a hotel in the ""modern"" style, which I suppose means that the lobby floor is very shiny and the hotel bar is out in the open.

The hotel rooms are nicely appointed, with a minibar and cable tv.  I thought the bed was average -- but i'm a very tough customer to please when it comes to hotel beds.  (They're usually far too firm for me.) 

The staff, like all Fairmonts is helpful and friendly.  This Fairmont is out near the ""gastown"" section of the city, which is quite touristy feeling.  I think that in general our group would probably have had a better time in the older Fairmont downtown -- but that's really not the hotel's fault -- just a note if you're looking at staying in this part of vancouver. 

This hotel is within short walking distance of a float plane terminal, so if you were interested in using a water taxi to get to another part of the area it might be quite convienent for that.  

There is an underground shopping center under this hotel, so if you need a snack or beverage, quite handy.",2008-11-27T00:28:29Z,143

282,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"OK so here's how it works apparently...if you are a newbie business traveller or only book hotels occasionally you get the chump deals. IF, however, you are a little more savvy and/or ""complain-y"", customer service improves 10-fold!

Once another savvier than me Yelper told me that you just have to sign up for Fairmont's President Club (which is free so why wouldn't everyone!?!?) internet is gratis! You also then get free daily newspapers and can start tallying up points to get a free nights stay or move up to Gold or Premium or something.
Anyway, i was mostly concerned about the internet so... problem was solved. 

But what recently impressed me was this...while making a reservation I was asked to complete a survey. Since i actually had a few grievances (the nasty perfumy bath products and recent increase in govt rates) I decided to spend 5 min on it. 

Well did the manager not email me giving me a better rate on my next trip (although acknowledging that all govt rates increased so nothing he could do about future trips) and saying that they had recently changed the bath products and would like to hear back. MAJOR POINTS! 
Good customer service is hard to come buy these days so I really appreciated the personal touch...not to mention the discount on 5 nights! 

Unfortunately I can't stay there in the future due to the price increase but will look out for discounts in the future.   

So where should I book next Yelpers?? Coast Coal Harbour is an option as is Wall Center...or should I go boutique with The Burrard?",2012-08-05T17:06:34Z,143

290,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"It's a great place to rent your bikes! We rented 2 e-bikes to ride in Stanley Park, and their service was great! From walking in the door to doing the paperwork to getting acquainted with our bikes, the whole experience took less than 20 minutes. They were fast and very professional! Their shop is in a great location - just a minute or two to the bike path that leads to Stanley Park's sea wall. The bikes are in great condition, too.",2023-10-07T15:33:57Z,32
291,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,They were extremely helpful and told us exactly how to ride an e bike which we rented. We were a few minutes over 2 hours but charged us for two hours.  I had left a cloth spectacle case in the bike pocket. I gave it up for lost.  Next day when we were near the shop I went in and just asked if they had found a blue cloth case. The guy remembered me and within 5 minutes came back with the cover. Great experience and service as well as a terrific value.,2023-09-18T04:19:45Z,32
292,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"Friendly, helpful staff and fair prices. Our bikes were in excellent condition and we had a blast biking Stanley Park, which is just a block or two away.",2023-07-10T03:46:02Z,32
293,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"Great people work there and it is pretty much an effortless process to rent a bike. I originally planned to have it all day, but had to cut it a little short and they properly adjusted the price correctly. No hassle or anything. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat.",2023-05-28T18:41:35Z,32
294,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"This is a great place to rent a bike. They charge you when you return for your usage. We had the bike five hours and paid for a 1/2 day. $28

It was super quick to checkout and return the bike. We had specialized multi gear bikes. They were in good condition. They give you a basket for free. There is a water bottle cage on the bike.",2019-07-29T00:43:54Z,32
295,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"A bolt from my e-bike fender fell off on a ride and I stopped in to Jo-E Cycles to see if they had a spare. A staff found the part I needed and installed it for no charge. They were friendly, welcoming and I will definitely be heading there for repairs in the future. Thank you!",2022-07-22T19:39:46Z,32
296,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,Thank you Jo-E bikes for fixing my bike tire. I was having trouble with the air valve and your guys fixed it and filled it without charge. Friendly and helpful team. I will come back when I need a tuneup,2022-08-12T18:08:05Z,32
297,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"Came by accident as the corner one was mayhem.

Smaller shop but lots of ppl helping around.   Another reason we chose this was their baby seat was a lot cleaner lol

Staff super helpful in buckling up my princess & her helmet.

90min for $14, pretty reasonable.

Easy comeback.",2018-07-18T21:03:12Z,32
298,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"I'm glad we found this place.   I was with a party of 8 and we wanted to ride around Stanley Park for a couple of hours.  We were going to get the bikes at Stokes but the price was nearly twice as what we paid here (~$12 vs $7).  Plus,  helmet and lock were included with each bike.  The staff were helpful in getting us paired with the right bikes.   The bikes and equipments are in good condition as well.   Would definitely recommend.",2022-08-02T00:45:48Z,32
299,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"Mechnic is awsome. My bike wad so bad condition, but he did major tune-up so fast, and even he cleaned my bike like new.
So happy with this service!!",2021-01-24T15:20:33Z,32
300,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,Thanks to the staff for the great service I received Sunday August 14th. Purchased a bike from them couple years ago and they always give me great service and always remember my name.,2022-08-16T02:33:19Z,32
301,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"We rented bikes here to go thru Stanley Park. You can just head down the street two of three blocks from the shop and you'll be on the seawall trail. 

The pricing is fair and a little cheaper than other rental places in the area. They charge per hour and you pay when you get back. Bikes and helmets were in good shape.",2019-06-08T02:10:18Z,32
302,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"Jo-E-Cycles popped up when my wife and I  were looking at a digital map of the Stanley Park area in Vancouver. I went to their web site and decided this was where we should rent some regular bikes from to ride around the seawall at the park. We actually walked past 3 different bike rental shops on the way to Jo-E's. Really glad we stuck to our first instincts. They set us up with perfect sized bikes, locks, helmets and a basket for the ride. A gentleman by the name of Majid was so kind to us that he actually hoped on a bike and took us to an entrance of Stanley Park. We loved the ride. The bikes rode flawlessly and the baskets were a great help to store our jackets in when the morning sun broke out from behind the clouds. A perfect day, a perfect ride and a perfect rental. I would highly recommend Jo-E-Cycles for your rental needs. As a matter of fact on the walk back toward the main street a couple were looking at the bikes at another rental shop that were more expensive and we sent them to Jo-E's.",2022-08-14T15:32:22Z,32
303,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,This made our trip! We rented these silly looking electric bikes and just had the best time! The price is hard to beat too! Jay was super helpful and friendly and got us set up in minutes. We rode around Stanley park and are so glad we chose this place to rent! Highly recommend this instead of regular bikes. Much more enjoyable and can see much more for about the same price!!,2018-06-20T18:39:22Z,32
304,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"Great prices - best we found on our short walk up the street. Fast service but while we rented 4 bikes, they initially brought out 3 and had to chase someone down to get the 4th. In the middle of the day, all electric assist bikes and scooters were rented out (some people in our group had medical conditions and couldn't do regular bikes) and they couldn't/wouldn't tell us who else in the area rented them. We mostly got scooter helmets? which made us look like bicycle cops, but It worked out fine. 

We didn't realize that if you leave the shop, turn right, immediately cross the street and go straight, it was a very empty street and a easy ride down into the park and sea wall route. We instead left the shop, turned right and walked straight down the hill. They are both about the same, it just would have been easier to go on to the quiet side street.

My bike tire needed a bit more air to be perfect but I lived. No water bottle holder on my bike whereas the others in my group did get them - be sure you check if that's important to you!",2018-09-05T20:09:05Z,32
305,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"Googled where to service a snowboard and these guys showed up. They were the only store (I tried west side ski and board and sport junkies) that would just edge my board without a full tune up or edge and wax. I was my own board and just wanted an edge. They were super helpful and I dropped it off and it was done within the hour! All the other places were saying a few days to pick up and were way more expensive. Totally recommend this place for servicing and the edging was perfectly done. 
This will be my go to for servicing!",2020-01-13T01:34:26Z,32
306,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"They gave me the worst bike:

-the gear was permanently stuck at 8 - meaning it was really really hard to bike

- the handlebar covering was 80 percent peeling off and smelled like sweat

- I used the kickstand, and when I put it back up, it was stuck so that it could not be put up all the way, blocking my pedal from biking. It left me stranded half way through Stanley park seawall thinking in going to have to walk this bike back to the shop until my male friend came to get me and kicked it back up with all his strength.

-there was also tape on the handlebar holding something together

When I returned the bike, I told the male staff about the broken kickstand, and he indifferently told me I just need to put the kickstand back up when I use it and that's why I couldn't pedal. Too bad we FIXED it for them by my friend having to use his strength to  kick it into place.

 I also told him the bike gear was stuck at 8. 

He didnt care, no apology, nothing, just like I was just telling him facts about the bike.

Could be my fault for not checking the bike properly before I left but I rushed to be with my friends as we departed for our trip. They only have 2 stars because my other friends were given brand new bikes to use at the start.


Please for the love of God check if your bikes are standard before you rent them out.",2019-05-11T18:25:29Z,32
307,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"My family and I compared prices at 5 different bike rental shops in the west end of Vancouver and JO-E CYCLES was definitely the best price!!
Also their bikes were very well maintained, staffs are very helpful and bikes are so good!! Definitely come back again.",2018-04-16T18:47:13Z,32
308,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"This is the best rental shop where I've visited.
Nice owner and kind staff :)
You are gonna b satisfied. I'm pretty sure.",2018-04-28T03:01:42Z,32
309,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"With a variety of choices available for the Stanley Park ride, I read through reviews and decided to go with Jo-E Cycles.  Everything was going fine until about halfway through my ride when the handlebars became completely loose.  Had to walk back half distance only to get accused of purposely damaging the bike myself (yes, because I really wanted to walk half of Stanley Park with a broken bike) and asking why I didn't call (I'm visiting from another country, no roaming).  Very disappointed with the experience and treatment by staff who justified her ""I'm not blaming you"" demeanor with ""some people rent for 5 hrs and tell us the bike is broken and want it for free.""  While I did end up getting one bike hire refunded after escalating my frustration in front of other customers, trying to save a couple of bucks on vacation was not worth the hassle.",2019-08-05T01:14:50Z,32
310,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"I rented a bike here and the service was really quick and friendly. The prices for rentals are one of the best in the area. My bike gear got jammed into the bike when I was on my way back to the shop and when I told the staff about it, they offered to charge the minimum. I am so grateful for such friendly and amazing service!",2020-06-25T23:55:32Z,32
311,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"I highly recommend this place for your summer fun!
They have the most reasonable price and also have great options!
They have usual bikes and electronic bikes! 
You do not need any license for electronic bike and scooter, just enjoy your speed! 
Also, staffs were really kind and helpful",2018-05-02T16:50:17Z,32
312,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,Rented ski gear here... kid lost the goggles at the ski resort... was asked for $100 to compensate the 'loss of use' while you see there are dozens goggles sitting on the shelf waiting to be rented out... they did admit the goggles worth only about $30 the most if it's brand new! Not the experience we are looking for... Do not recommend!,2020-01-04T05:23:38Z,32
313,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,Very friendly and efficient staff. Highly recommend!! Wide variety of bikes to choose from.,2018-10-27T21:38:07Z,32
314,Jo-E Bike Rentals,4.6,"Fun tip:  Try the Jo-e 10 if you want a different view of Stanley Park. The bike trail around the Stanley Park  has a beautiful ocean view. But if you want a different view of Stanley Park, try the Jo-e 10 or 30 driveway. The Jo-e 10 or 30 tours you to the woods area of the island. The ride gives you a really peaceful and relaxing feeling.",2018-04-12T17:58:55Z,32

316,Three Peaks Lodge,1.0,"5 stars for Mt. Seymour! 1 for others.  

For the record: I love Mt. Seymour and all the opportunities there to enjoy nature from ski, snowshoe, toboggan, board, hike, cross country ski etc. I also love their staff (and patrons) at ticketing, cleaning *(jolly old fellow!) guest services, rentals and chair operations (not good experiences with 1 staff doing ski patrol and another---see below).

1 star for service that evening and 1 star for food and misrepresentation

Came for my first time after asking about where to eat - two older men told me it was a good place and had good burgers.  Wasn't in the mood for another burger (many people picked it $16 - a bit pricey for a Pub). NEVER again - rather eat at A&W with a nicer service.

Was practically ORDERED to sit at bar with three men who took up most of the area.  I said no thank you. Told again that I must sit there even though there were 8 tables free at 9pm on a SUNDAY night!  I basically said no  again.  Excuse me, but I do have a right to sit somewhere that I feel most comfortable and high chairs are not it because I'm short! I'm also tired and want to relax. Who are you to tell me where to sit lady? Order was an entree that took nearly 40 minutes to arrive and did not have selected item because out of stock and was not told about it prior.  

The entree was not enough to feed an adult (8 regular sized ravioli!) and was missing ""truffled"" part of it which is allover the menu, including missing from the fries! The dish normally would take 8 minutes to cook and stir in sauce ie. max 12 minutes (ravioli) with salad and toasted but very oily garlic type bread. Was brought a drink late into meal.  Sat there noticing some people were cold and had to re-wear ski outfits. Suddenly felt colder, and realized the vent was blowing cold air in so I ate while shivering and legs literally froze off. Downstairs same issue ie. 9pm. The washroom on main level smelled of a back alley. Paid nearly $20 and took over an hour wait - was colder than how I came inside!",2018-03-01T09:02:34Z,1
