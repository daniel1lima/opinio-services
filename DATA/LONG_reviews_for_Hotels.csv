0,Versante Hotel,4.4,"Absolutely fabulous! This is a luxurious hotel you wouldn't expect to find near an airport The rooms are spacious and have everything you need. They are very comfortable. The bathroom is exquisite. The large soaking tub and the heated floors really are over and above. I love the Dyson hairdryer with the diffuser for my curly hair. 

I love the lighting system and decor.

The staff is friendly and the food is excellent. 

I highly recommend it.",2023-10-21T22:35:42Z,23
1,Versante Hotel,4.4,"I had a couple of problems in my room, but this could have easily been a 5 star hotel. Check in was prompt and friendly. The employee at the lobby met us as we walked in, as we came in late. Gave us the rundown and welcomed us to his beautiful hotel. It was decorated for the holidays, and absolutely beautiful.
The room was instagram worthy. Eclectic wallpaper, dyson hairdryer in the bathroom, heated bathroom floors, robes, slippers, Nespresso coffee maker, and a showstopper of a tub. Impressive! The beds were so comfortable and the pillows were great. I absolutely love a Nespresso machine. I hate the garbage a one cup brewer makes, but they really DO make a fine cup of coffee.
Why four stars? There were a couple of problems with my room that could be fixed and easily be 5 stars. First off, the plugs in the desk and nightstand did not work. I am sure it was a breaker or something that needed to be flipped, but it was late and I was not about to call up for maintenance. I had to plug my work phone in in the bathroom and my personal one in the alarm clock on the other side of the bed. First world problems indeed, but that was a lot of plugs that were not working. Secondly, the tub was not holding water. I used the stopper in the drain and it continued to drain water. Also the temperature of the water coming out of the tub was not as hot as the shower. I had to plug up the tub to make it hold water.
As I said, these are easily fixed issues but not something one wants to do after a late check in. I would LOVE to stay here again. It is in an industrial area, but there are a few things worth checking out. I read that there is an amazing night market nearby if you are there on the right night. Also the location to the airport is great.",2023-11-23T03:37:11Z,23
2,Versante Hotel,4.4,"When our flight was canceled, and I was extremely upset because we were going to lose a whole day of vacation they showed up to this hotel, very frantic and emotional, and Chloe from the front desk was so kind and gentle with me when I was upset, she made me feel so much better. And then we went to have dinner in the lounge with Henry and he was also magnificent. This hotel gets 1000 stars. They are amazing. They hire amazing staff and if you're in the area you need to visit the hotel it's absolutely gorgeous.",2024-03-23T03:06:13Z,23
3,Versante Hotel,4.4,"Room is stylish and bathroom has a nice egg bathtub with heated floors. The room was a lot smaller than expected however and there is a charge for bottled water. Overall, stay was pleasant but felt more like a 4 star hotel rather than 5 star.",2024-04-05T01:29:33Z,23
4,Versante Hotel,4.4,"We found ourselves in an area that was a bit industrial and without a clear direction the entrance is located in a sudden spot right off the nearby intersection. We missed the entrance and had to cautiously circle the block.
 
Upon arrival, there was no attendant and we parked in front of the valet booth. As we entered the lobby, a staff person came out and told us we could not park in front of it and had to move our car a couple feet forward. Really?

Hotel ~ brand new, modern design, new new new. Special occasion had us book their luxury suite.

Entering the room, it was blistering hot. Went back to the front desk to explain our heat issue. We were told since we just checked in, it will take 30 minutes to cool down. 6 hours later returning after venturing around town, the room was still unbearable. The front desk tried relating it to being on the top floor and all the combination of heat riding and the sun directly into the windows. Regardless we had to switch to a lower level with no direct sunlight. Still muggy and uncomfortable. Though built recently, the maintenance staff shared this hotel AC system does not seem adequate to vent cool air throughout the building. Three days of uncomfortable temperatures in the room. Be forewarned!

We chose this hotel because it was a 10 minute walk to the Richmond Night Market and about a 15 minute walk from the main cluster of hotels & retail.

Amenities ~ rooftop pool was nice to splash in though the view was overlooking industrial warehouses. Rain shower was nice but can be seen by onlookers from the parking lot below. Must pull the blinds for privacy which ruins the point of a soaking tub view. Bar akin the hotel was not open.

No snack bar available so annoyingly you have to shop somewhere else and bring your own.

Front desk service ~ disappointing from the start. Not enthusiastic or informative about exploring Richmond.

Their blog has been not been updated for almost a year.",2022-10-28T12:31:41Z,23
5,Versante Hotel,4.4,"My family and I stayed at this hotel two months ago. It's situated near the Vancouver International Airport. Staff was very friendly and check-in was quick.

The hotel was hip and modern and the rooms were beautiful. We had a room with two queen beds and there was a chair, desk, refrigerator, safe and iron.  

The bathroom had a half open tub and rainfall shower and two sinks. The toilet had a separate area with a glass door. It also had a Dyson hair dryer which we fell in love with!

The hotel also had a restaurant on the ground floor, fitness centre and a rooftop pool but we didn't get a chance to try it.

Unfortunately, with most hotels in Richmond, there was no free parking so we just opt with the valet parking. Even though it was expensive, their service was friendly and prompt.

I would definitely stay here again!",2023-01-04T20:22:12Z,23
6,Versante Hotel,4.4,"If you're looking for a nice hotel before an early morning flight - Versante Hotel is a good call. They're close by the airport, and they have a solid rooftop pool, complimentary slippers, comfortable beds, and a beautiful deep soaking bath (complete with lovely bath salts etc). 

This hotel served us well for some self care before our departure, and I enjoyed the unique decor,  but unless we have another early morning flight heading out from Vancouver Airport in the near future, I think I'd rather stay in the heart of Vancouver. 

Like most airport hotels in the area - Versante Hotel - is not conducive to walking around and exploring the general vicinity. There is just busy traffic, empty buildings, and construction going on around the hotel. I was also not a huge fan of the restaurant offerings during our visit (it looks like it's been slightly updated since). The menu was creative - but it was pricey and if you were looking for straightforward simple menu offerings (which I prefer for good rest and/or a morning flight) - this is not your spot. 

We ended up getting food in the heart of Vancouver and stocking up on some light snacks at a healthy grocery store.

After our city exploring  - it was nice to come on back to our comfortable room here - take a soothing bath, and get some fantastic rest before our early departure.

Trust.",2023-01-10T21:51:40Z,23
7,Versante Hotel,4.4,"This hotel is excellent, great service, great food, and the rooms are very spacious including a shower room and system that controls the temperature and the lights, their outdoor pool provides a wonderful view of the city, (and their staff is very helpful if you end up leaving your glasses at the pool side) that happened to me when i was there lol",2023-08-04T13:36:32Z,23
8,Versante Hotel,4.4,Loved the hotel and all of the high tech amenities. Service was great. Parking was affordable but it was a hassle getting in after hours.,2022-11-13T02:37:47Z,23
9,Versante Hotel,4.4,"This hotel is both instagrammable and comfortable. Creative interior design, views of downtown, a heated rooftop pool and hot tub with views of the planes landing, a comfortable bed, good plug, lighting and charging situations, a cool bathtub - what else can you need? Oh wait, a friendly staff, a few blocks from reliable public transportation, and a nice in house restaurant. And dog friendly - usually hotels this nice are not! I'd definitely stay here again.",2022-10-01T23:56:51Z,23
10,Versante Hotel,4.4,"Had the pleasure of staying here for the weekend and what a treat! EVERYONE was so nice, attentive, helpful, welcoming and the list goes on! The room was clean and modern! Loved everything about it! Housekeeping didn't get a chance to clean our room when we were out in the AM so they offered a late night cleaning while we were out again and they definitely came through! Great amenities! Valet parking for an extra charge but so worth it!
The only downfall was the first night I could hear the doors open and close and people out in the hallway almost all night. I still rate 5 stars though because the hotel itself was, for the most part, a great place to stay!
Will definitely be back!",2021-08-30T05:31:37Z,23
11,Versante Hotel,4.4,"We had a very comfortable stay here at Versante. The hotel is very nice, it's super close to the airport. There are a good amount of dining choices here, definitely worth checking out. There is a shuttle that they can take you back to the airport which was super helpful. We will definitely be back again.",2023-04-06T20:24:10Z,23
12,Versante Hotel,4.4,Perfect hotel with a great staff that is extremely attentive! Will recommend to anyone traveling to Vancouver!,2023-08-12T19:49:51Z,23
13,Versante Hotel,4.4,"Words are not enough to describe the ambience & comfort this boutique hotel offers. The street entrance to this hotel is a bit odd if you don't know the area but the moment you step out of your car for valet parking to the moment you check out is an experience. Every detail has been well thought out (smart windows, heated bathroom floors & dyson hair dryer), every staff has been trained well (kind, helpful & can carry a good conversation) & if staycation is what you're looking for, you don't need to leave this hotel. From the roof top pool & hot tub to the amazing restaurants, everything is in the hotel property.",2022-09-19T02:41:20Z,23
14,Versante Hotel,4.4,"Pros: Beautiful room, top notch appliances (Ex: Dyson hair Dryer!), Comfortable bed, friendly staffs (during check in/out)

Cons: Shares parking garage with retail building that closes at 11:30PM, almost got locked out and couldn't get back in until luckily a restaurant employee let us back into the garage.  Went to the front desk for help but there was nobody there :( (it was later explained that there is only one staff in the evenings)/ parking overnight at the garage cost $30.00!!! The hotel crosses the street only charge $15.00 and able to return to it at any time of the day/ Hot water only available in the evening, wife tried to take a bath in the tub the next morning, but only lukewarm water was available :( / Tried to call front desk for extra box of tissue but hotel phone while fancy but didn't work :(",2022-12-13T18:36:41Z,23
15,Versante Hotel,4.4,"Great location, nice staff, nice room!
This hotel is a little fancy but rate is reasonable. Design is very modern and staff is super friendly. I'll come back again!",2021-09-20T19:13:24Z,23
16,Versante Hotel,4.4,"We choose the Versante after we suddenly had to change our travel plans for Vancouver. The hotel was excellent. Clean and right spacious rooms with lots of amenities. It's really nice that the rooms have door bells and buttons to set privacy or indicate that the rooms should be made up. The location is central to the Canada Linie trains so downtown Vancouver can be reached in about 20 minutes. There are also two malls in the vicinity which make for ample shopping. 

The soaking bath tube and the roof pool give plenty of opportunity to get into the water. 

The staff is really helpful and nice. When our flight was delayed we were offered a late check out at no additional costs. 

The free airport shuttle is also worth mentioning. 

Highly recommended!",2022-07-29T12:01:06Z,23
17,Versante Hotel,4.4,"The Versante legitimately can describe itself as not your typical airport hotel. The rooms feature colourful decor with all the usual amenities you'd expect plus a few you might not; for example, the contents of the minibar were complimentary. (And as a tea drinker, I love having a kettle in the room.)

The bathroom was gloriously spacious and left my husband wondering if we could fit a rainfall shower with heated floor and free standing bathtub in our bathroom at home.

The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.

There is an excellent restaurant on the ground floor.

Only downsides are the area (convenient to the airport and walking distance to the skytrain, but not particularly scenic) and parking (pricy valet parking is pretty much the only option).",2021-10-04T00:11:33Z,23
18,Versante Hotel,4.4,"Really cool place .. but let's get right to the restaurant ... food. OMG ‼so good . 
Chef William torched the oysters( delicious sauce ) 
 Salad .. nothing ordinary .. delicious 
Pasta .. tagliatelle. ... WOW  
And the the dessert .. 
We'll be back. Thankyou Brad .. bartender .. was our server since the restaurant was booked .. Thankyou Ruby .. making our experience so amazing",2021-09-11T02:28:32Z,23
19,Versante Hotel,4.4,"I booked Versante Hotel for a night for a birthday celebration. I had never traveled to Canada before and was worried that I would feel unwelcome or too much like a tourist. The entire staff made us feel welcome from the time we pulled into the parking lot. The woman at the front desk offered refreshments while checking in, and the valet had great suggestions for activities around the neighborhood. There was a lot of construction around the area, but the view from the room was still stunning and the inside of the hotel itself was gorgeous. I had to make a stop on the second floor just to look at the bathroom. There is plenty to do to entertain yourself within the hotel, and the restaurants on site served possibly the best meals I've ever had. I will definitely stay here again.",2022-05-26T16:28:36Z,23
20,Versante Hotel,4.4,Very poor customer service at hotel reception. I have never had to speak to both the hotel front desk and manager without issue resolved. Team not interested in guest satisfaction if an issue raised. Would not recommend staying here. Plenty more 5 star hotels vs boutique hotels available in Vancouver .,2023-01-10T17:56:13Z,23
21,Versante Hotel,4.4,Super close to the night market! Staff was super helpful and friendly. The room was super cute and clean! The amenities were very nice as well! Would come back here again!,2022-10-08T21:55:07Z,23
22,Versante Hotel,4.4,Isabelle the events co-ordinator/ bartender at Versante bar is the best you'll ever have. Do yourself a favour and go grab a drink at the lobby bar. I haven't tried the food but will return with an updated review once I do. Currently I wish I could give this 10 stars because it has been the perfect experience at the lobby bar!,2021-09-04T04:38:31Z,23
23,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Love, love loved this hotel. The service was so, incredibly friendly and accommodating, our room was amazing, the location is perfect, and it's really not that expensive considering how crazy hotel prices have gone in the past 5 years. 

They gave us sparkling wine when we checked in as well as the option to upgrade from a room to a pretty fabulous suite, and I think the upgrade was maybe only an extra $100. The highlights were the panoramic view of downtown, two bathrooms, heated floors and of course the Dyson hairdryer. 

The concierge incredible. He was so friendly and helpful. I wish I could remember his name. He arranged dinner for us, gave us lots of tips, and just, overall, made us feel welcome and like very important guests. I am pretty sure he makes everyone feel that way. 

Great place!",2023-11-07T14:18:12Z,181
24,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Parking is about $50+ each day, I stayed at other nicer hotels that came with parking , cheaper parking on the street outside that goes overnight for a $1-$2. Stated through Expedia there was a pool and hot tub, there isn't. The room was nice, bathroom as well no issues there & they did provide tooth brush which was nice. Check in on all was easier on the app then when you get there, the guy at the desk ignored me like 3x when I asked for help with the payment on their card reader. Seen other hotels that had parking & breakfast/restaurants or even a pool that were just as good for location in city.",2024-03-30T16:31:57Z,181
25,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Beautiful boutique hotel that is close to the fun part of downtown and davie street. Had an amazing girls night here, and loved being in the heart of the city. It's so luxurious and we truly felt pampered by the heated bathroom floors, amazing shower pressure and all the high end amenities. The concierge and valet services were always available when we needed them.",2023-11-22T18:17:38Z,181
26,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Couldn't have picked a lovelier place to stay and celebrate our anniversary. It started the moment we got out of the car and approached the door, where the manager Scott greeted us with a very warm ""Happy Anniversary!"" welcome. Such a lovely gesture that typifies the care and kindness of the staff here. We spent a few minutes in the lobby getting fantastic recommendations from Scott and his front desk staff, and we knew right away we were in for a treat of a stay.

We then met front desk worker extraordinaire and new best friend Brendan :) He was such a fun, sweet, kind person who treated us like family and personally made sure that we had the very best experience possible. He has a wonderful energy that will instantly make your day! The cleaning staff were lovely as well, even just when passing by in the hallway they always greeted us with a warm hello and a big smile. So many little things make this hotel truly stand out.

To top things off, we happened to run into manager Scott in the airport as we were getting ready to fly home and he was heading off on vacation. Even there, super early in the morning, he was so friendly and kind. It was a perfect send off to an absolutely lovely visit to beautiful Vancouver. Thank you so much to Scott, Brendan, and the rest of the amazing staff at the Opus. We will always remember you so fondly and hope to see you again.",2023-10-13T21:32:10Z,181
27,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Great hotels abound. Of the countless ones I've experienced around the world (and in Vancouver), Opus stands out. Its staff are the warmest and most-genuine I've encountered. The consistency of a sunshine spirit across all teams -- bell/valet, guest services, housekeeping -- speaks strongly to excellent hiring and a great management team that shapes and reinforces this culture. That simply adds to pleasures of its premium location and the superb Faubourg patisserie, which made every morning a taste of the Paris life. 

I expect that this will be my new home base whenever I return to Vancouver!",2023-05-13T20:52:45Z,181
28,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"We had a very comfortable stay here at OPUS. We loved it for its location and the amazing restaurant they have attached, Capo. The staff were super nice and the rooms were nice. Definitely will be back again when we're in Vancouver next.",2023-05-31T16:10:35Z,181
29,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"The great service, location, and other elements of the stay overshadowed a few negatives of our stay. The front-desk staff and concierge were great to interact with and super helpful, especially when fetching an item from our valet-parked car. The location could not be better: across the street is a subway station, at least two bus-lines have stops within a block of the OPUS, there are fantastic restaurants of several types (higher-end/classy/romantic dining to quicker sit down & take-out places) and bars within 1-2 blocks, and the water is just 3 blocks away; the water taxis (False Creek Ferries & AquaBus) have a stop right there as well which makes travel to Granville Island and other spots along False Creek super fast and fun to get to. There's also markets and a great grocery store (Urban Fare) a block or two away. We ""customized"" our stay by requesting a room with purple walls (check out their pictures to get an idea of the color options) and they were able to get us such a room. The room was pretty reasonable (deluxe courtyard room) but the standouts for us were the rain shower (probably one of the best showers I've ever been in, but it doesn't have a hand-held shower head/nozzle which may bother some) and the fireplace.

Finding OPUS on first arrival was more challenging than it needed to be because we arrived during the day and there's only a tiny sign that you have to know is there to identify the building from the restaurant and pastry place at the bottom (the building is lit up purple at night) and difficult to see valet parking sign (impossible to see if there are cars in it, and that isn't uncommon since they only can handle 2 cars parked out front at a time). The room itself had a few issues I wouldn't expect at a hotel costing as much as this per night: the bathroom has two sliding doors which don't meet well in the middle, and one door would slowly slide open if not fully opened; the room's refrigerator had a key-lock to latch it closed (I've never seen that before) and as a result would not easily open or latch, and didn't get very cold even when latched.

Would definitely recommend staying here primarily for the location and easy transit options for people wanting to do a lot of things downtown.",2022-09-15T04:39:25Z,181
30,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Nice boutique hotel in the center of Yaletown, which turns out to be one of the happening areas in downtown Vancouver currently.  Staff and management are super friendly.  Amer, the manager on duty, was VERY pleasant and helpful in resolving an issue I had with our reservation.  The hotel is clean and relatively quiet, despite being right on a well travelled road.  Food at COPA, the hotel restaurant is good as well, not your typical low grade hotel fare.  Definitely worth looking at if you are staying in Vancouver, whether it is business or pleasure!",2023-03-20T22:35:51Z,181
31,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Great location. The rest, not so great. 

They checked us into the wrong room, with a Queen instead of a king bed. Then when we complained, they never apologized and took 30 min to call back with a ""solution"".

Moved us to another room - but we had to ask for the adjustment to our bill which they would only honor as a bottle of wine or restaurant credit... tacky move. 

The room they moved us to was awful. It was over a club and even with earplugs in, we had zero sleep until 4am when it quieted down. I live in the city but the sounds of screaming 20 somethings is hard to drown out. 

Finally - the breakfast we were forced to go to in order to redeem our credit was horrific. They delivered someone else's food to our table. Left it there for 5 minutes and then just took it to her table after. Eeeeek! 
We waited 45 min for coffee and 50 min for our food. 

Honestly, I have been excited to try this hotel for years. It was dated and clearly not what it used to be. Too bad. I would recommend looking elsewhere. Two stars for the location and the awesome night staff that brought us earplugs at 2am.",2022-10-23T22:38:51Z,181
32,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"If I could leave 10 stars I would!  The Opus Hotel has imbedded in them what many others in the hospitality industry want.  A staff of professionals who understand how to make a person feel!  The essence of this place is how each individual professional shows up as their authentic self, while ensuring each guest has a seamless thoughtful experience. My wife and I frequently stay in high end exclusive places around the world.  The Opus hotel is the boutique hotel that treats each guest like a beloved friend who stopped in for a weekend.  We were welcomed in by Vince and Jean. Vince ensured we had a beautiful glass of rose to start our weekend.  Jean is a resturant savant. She ensured our culinary experience was spectacular. We met Brandon the next day, it is clear Brandon is concierge extraordinaire. He anticipated and delivered options that ensured our experiences around town were well balanced and interesting. Justin ensured we would be able to view the US Open a tennis finals when asking the bar to play it in their screen. When we wanted to take the complimentary battery assist bikes out for the afternoon, Mattias ensured they were properly fitted and gave a comprehensive overview on how to operate the bikes. When we needed to extend the three hour use time we called back and was granted an additional hour so we could finish our breakfast and enjoy the peddle back ""home"". Fiona made our departure easy and worry free. Her attention to detail when reviewing the folio was only matched by her insistence we stay a little longer for the sheer joy of each others company.  It felt like we were saying goodby to friends we would soon see again. This coupled with a room that was clean and well tended. The location of the Opus hotel is unmatched, anything you want is within a 10 to 15 minute walk, the restaurants are incredible, the rail really is jut 32 steps away. The waterfront 3 blocks away.",2023-09-12T17:42:52Z,181
33,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"I really wanted to like this place as the website made it look so trendy and modern, but I was wrong.

The lobby was about the best part of the hotel.  The staff was very snobby and not welcoming.  The carpet was dirty and the windows OMG looked as if they never had been cleaned.  

It was however a great location, but I would abandon the location and stay at a nicer hotel.  I will not be back and would not recommend it to others.

BTW-DO NOT get the courtyard view unless you want a view of dead plants and cigarette butts!",2010-12-31T03:06:33Z,181
34,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"I live like maybe one minute from this hotel - but through work we got a free night at the Opus - yes please!

The service at the front desk was super friendly and helpful!  Then you make your way up to your room and choose either the 'blue' or 'red' elevators, each of which are playing different music / creating ambiance.  

Hotel hallways usually disappoint me for some reason.  Even in nice hotels, they can be dark with low ceilings, etc - but as soon as you step off the elevator's short ride (I mean, the hotel is only 5 stories I think) the hallways that lead to the rooms are luxurious feeling.  Then when you get to your room - wow!

This is a 'boutique hotel' - which I have found, means that it is almost as if you are staying in a cool friend's loft guestroom.  The room's amenities were abundant: from the canned oxygen to the bathroom products, mini bar, huge down pillows, fluffy down comforter, velvet couch, and so much  more.  There was even music provided to listen to, helping create the perfect atmosphere!

As well, the rooms included interesting 'Profiles' which gave recommendations of services and places to go around Yaletown and within the hotel, depending on what type of experience you were looking for.

Oh, and another quirk of the hotel is that in some of the rooms, the bathroom has windows - so...word of warning...people who live across the street, sometimes get a good show!  ; )

My one regret here is that I didn't get to order their famous Breakfast in Bed.  : (
Next time!!!",2009-04-01T21:18:49Z,181
35,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Great hotel in Yaletown.  It's a boutique hotel, so the rooms are nice.  There's a twist to the rooms. There is a window in the restroom to the rest of the hotel room.  Make eyes at your hotel significant other, while taking a shower.  Or #2 I guess...

Boutique hotels are great, but this one only had two drawers.  The room service was excellent however.  Some of the best food that I have had, from room service.  Caesar salad and gnocchi, yum. And comparing the prices to other hotels that give you cheese sandwiches for ten bucks, this place added a star.  

The location is very convenient, with a lot in the nearby neighborhood.  Their restaurant and bar are great.  The only problem is if you want to go to sleep, and drunk fashionistas are yelling as they leave at 3am. 

Internet is 15 a day.",2009-09-08T03:21:43Z,181
36,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Originally drawn to this place for the architecture and decor, I was pleasantly surprised by the warmth of the staff and numerous amenities.
I've stayed here on and off for the last six years and I'm a fan of the place but they need to improve a few things.

Pluses:
Great location in Yaletown, easy to get around most of Van
Free bikes for guests!!!
The doormen remember me year after year even though I'm usually there only in October! You can get some great mtn bike trail and boarding spots from these guys.
They love dogs.
Each time you come to stay they give you a little extra perk (chocolates, room upgrades, etc.)

Minuses:
 The sliding doors to the washrooms are cheap!, They don't close and there is a 2"" gap between the wall so if you have a friend in the room there is no privacy. Being an architect I know its not hard to design nor expensive to execute this simple detail.
I did get stuck last time what must have been their cheapest room, small,dark and noisy and no fireplace... what the hell!.
No bikes in the hotel room and I have to wait for an escort to get my bike off the rack of the car. OK, when the bike is worth more than my car, its a little unnerving. Plus when you want to ride at 5 am its a P in the A.
Unless, they changed it, no free in-room wi-fi, but the business center is a great place to check in on the shop from time to time.

Overall I would stay here again but I'm anxious to try the Moda.",2009-06-12T02:44:52Z,181
37,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,Awesome hotel with great amenities. Hotel rooms were spacious!! Located near everything and is across the street from sky train. Everyone was accommodating. Special recognition to Toby who made our last day special. Will definitely return to this hotel. I will highly recommend this hotel.,2017-08-11T15:15:10Z,181
38,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"When we told friends we reserved a room at Opus, they all exclaimed ""Oh, I LOVE that hotel! It's the best one in Vancouver."" Granted, it's also been a few years since our friends have visited Vancouver. As a local woman said in response to our choice of hotel, ""Well, it's certainly different.""

We only met one of the housekeeping staff and we absolutely ADORED her. If you've stayed at Opus, you know who I'm talkin' 'bout. This woman more than made up for some of the concierge staff at the front desk that need to learn how to acknowledge guests with, say, a greeting like ""Hello"".

At one time, I'm sure Opus was *the* hotel in Vancouver. The hotel's first floor is trying to incorporate too many modern trends in its interior design, the space felt more California than Canada. Our room was spacious - we upgraded to a Superior Room with a king bed and spa bath - but the mattress on our bed wasn't very comfortable.

You can find deals for The Opus if you book through Expedia. In our case, we booked our room through Alaska Airlines which had an almost 50% discount of the normal rate. You really, really, really don't want to pay full-price for these rooms.",2009-04-08T21:53:59Z,181
39,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"We've stayed at Opus twice.  The first time our room looked over Hamilton so I was delighted to spy a Marimekko and non-chain coffee shop within a stone's throw.  That room was small but cosy.  Our second time we got a room right by the elevator, overlooking busy Cambie Street.  This room had more space but the downside was the noise.  They remembered we stayed previously and welcomed us with two yummy snacks- an Asian inspired cracker and a flavored popcorn snack.

3 stars for a disappointing breakfast our 2nd time in.  It took several minutes to get seated despite a nearly empty dining room.  I asked the waitress for a booster and several minutes later we got a booster.  By that point I was going to walk out and go get breakfast elsewhere because we still hadn't ordered and I saw the few people there just helping themselves to juice.  Not a bad idea considering it was $5 a pop.  When we finally got to order, the host didn't know what the omelet of the day was and had to go back to inquire.  

There were only 2 people working the whole restaurant- the dizzy waitress and the host.  It was getting busy.  I could have sworn I heard them telling diners coming in after us that they had no eggs.  That's most of the menu.  I frankly couldn't understand the waitress because she had a heavy accent.

Later, at the lovely Agro coffee house next door I saw a table that was trying to get a table at Opus.  They were told to wait in the lounge for a seat and after several minutes they came back to check on whether they were going to get a table.  I think they bailed.  Moral of the story- grab breakfast elsewhere.

Liked that we got free valet parking because of their hybrid vehicle policy.

Loved having an iPad in the room- we totally saved on roaming charges!

Plenty of people have mentioned privacy screens in the rooms.  Just note there is no privacy screen in the bathrooms down below the restaurant.  I could clearly see a guy taking a whiz from the ladies' room.  The room looks like it is a mere reflection but in reality you can see right into the men's room.  There is only a curtain of mardi gras ball necklace-like curtains in between the two rooms.  Enjoy!",2012-03-05T17:21:15Z,181
40,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"This hotel is located in a section of Vancouver called Yaletown, seems a new trendy area.  We stayed this past summer for a few nights.  I liked the location very much while the hubby felt it was too trendy yuppie-ish for his taste.  The location is so perfect, very close to the water just a few blocks and a nice walk.  There is a train station right across the street so you can go just about anywhere without having to drive which I loved!  Also lots of great restaurants walking distance and lots of great little trendy shops intermingled.  Many seemed to focus more on items for men but did find some wonderful home stores.  

My 6 year old LOVED everything about this hotel and wanted to take pictures everywhere, even in the elevator.  The place is uber modern and trendy .  The lobby looks like a cool night club with silver beads hanging from the ceiling to create walls of silver coolness.  While it was cool to look at and take pictures of, it was not a cozy place for a family to hang out, this is definitely a space for the 20 something crowd.  But who needs a lobby when you have a great room?

Our room was pretty swanky, a bit on the smaller side but enough room for the 3 of us.  It felt very zen like, cool wall colors, minimalist design, clean, crisp yet soft to the touch white linens ( I LOVE white bedding!) with shoji screen doors to the bathroom.  Our bathroom had floor to ceiling windows overlooking the street entrance.  The bathroom was ultra contemporary with very white subway tile against dark wood vanity (did I mention I love white tile too?).  Please note, people can see you in the bathroom so use the privacy screens if you are bathing or using the toilet.  The hubby insisted that we could not be seen so I had to go outside and check for myself and there he was standing over the toilet doing his business for the entire street to see.  Thankfully only his back was seen and from that moment on our privacy screens were in use.

This is a great place to stay especially for the young trendy types.  The staff was friendly and helpful (loved the pink polos!).  the rate was very reasonable and competitive, perfect location, nice comfortable room and cool lobby area for those into the night scene.",2011-01-03T00:54:48Z,181
41,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"This hotel is amazing...

-The security is solid.
-There service is top notch. 
-The layout/design is fresh, modern and relaxing.
-The location in Yaletown is ideal... just a little off the beaten path but still in the middle of everything.

TIPS:
-Great for singles/ couples/ business meetings.
-The bar is kick ass on Saturdays... very cool.
-There is a wine/liquor store across the street next to the Starbucks... I believe they do wine tastings there every Thursday. Check it out! They will even ship wine for you.
-There is healthy/grocery about 2 blocks up on Davie... excellent food and selection.
-The staff can help you check in to your flight right at the hotel... There is an airline checkin terminal at the business center... it's not for every airline, but if the staff will assist you with any other airline. What a time saver!
-For a quick bite to eat, try the tex-mex food around the corner - Salsa & Agave. 1223 Pacific Boulevard. Not amazing food, but it's very convenient.",2008-11-16T15:32:40Z,181
42,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"It was one day before my birthday and my girlfriend said I needed to pack for a few days in Vancouver.  What a cool surprise gift!!!

So, we get to Vancouver and head straight to the Opus Hotel, which is located in Yaletown.  If you are familiar with San Francisco, Yaletown is similar to SOMA.  I cannot say enough about how much we enjoyed this location.  We walked virtually everywhere, just like we do in SF, and the few times we needed a cab or a water taxi, it was right there.  There is also a casino along the waterfront that is within walking distance...bonus!

The Opus is a smaller hotel, almost boutique size, with a popular bar/nightclub and tremendous style.  During weekend nights, the Ferrari's and Lamborghini's were lined up at the valet.  The lobby is really fun, and houses some of the overflow from the bar.  One night, there was a DJ.

I am not sure what room my girlfriend booked, but we were upgraded at check-in to the penthouse.  Woohoo!  The penthouse was not very big, but it was perfectly setup for a cozy weekend, which is exactly what we wanted.  The living room was red and had a flat screen television, a big sofa, floating tables, a desk, a bar, a half-bath, and a fireplace that was situated on the wall between the living room and bedroom.  The bedroom had a canopy bed, another flat screen television above the fireplace, and a wonderful master bath with a glass-enclosed shower that was visble from the bed.  Along one entire wall, behind the curtains, was a pair of sliding glass doors that allow you to step outside and walk around the entire unit.  Only the penthouse units (2 total) have outdoor space, so that is quite a novelty.

The service at this hotel was very good.  It didn't seem very crowded when we were there as we rarely saw other guests.  The only time it seemed busy was during the nightclub hours.  The concierge gave us good directions on several occasions as well as good food suggestions.  The room service was very good when we ordered.

I want to go back to Vancouver this summer, and will likely stay here again.  My only problem is that anything less than the penthouse would be a let-down at this point and I doubt we will get the free upgrade next time around.  Maybe there is a method to their madness.",2009-06-30T06:22:04Z,181
43,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,Friendly staff.  Nice hotel room.  In a good location across from restaurants. I would stay here again.,2023-08-15T18:44:37Z,181
44,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Recently my husband and I made our first trip out to Canada and stayed here at the Opus, we were warmly welcomed with complimentary champagne and such friendly staff as soon as we check in. Not only that, but they had complimentary bikes that you could reserve for 3 hours which I felt was very fair as a lot of activities we wanted to do were close by. Lots of restaurants walking distance from the hotel and just across the street was public transportation which really made our trip, we didn't have to worry about finding parking, paying for it and having to cut our actives short due to time restriction. Something really neat in my opinion was the elevator system, you couldn't get the elevator to work without having a room key which I felt is very safe nowadays. Definitely recommend staying here, thank you to the staff who made us feel so welcomed!",2022-10-15T06:15:09Z,181
45,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Great stay at Opus Hotel.  During my road trip, I had stayed all sorts of sub-par hotel (ones that I had high hopes for but ended up disappointed), so I had very low expectations for Opus.  Check in was a breeze.  Even though I arrived at a busy time, there was enough space in front for me to valet the car.  The valet person came out very quickly.  The front person (I wish I got his name) was super nice and efficient about the checking in process.  He found out that this was my first time in town and gave me a map with a few good recommendations.  All a welcome turn from my other hotel experience during this trip. 

The room itself was so nice.  It smelled clean and looked very well kept.  I had some issues with the heater working at some of my other hotels (maybe it's me??), but I had no issues here.  The restrooms were also very clean.  The restroom was one of those where there is a window so you can watch TV if you would like while showering or taking a bath.  I also asked extra towels and they were very quick about getting me the towels. 

As for the location, I am not super familiar with the area, so I am not sure if I was in a trendy location.  But, there were a lot of restaurants to walk to (found this amazing pizza joint on my walk), breweries (they were closed when I took a walk after dinner), and market (I picked up some snacks).  So, I was definitely well equipped during my time here. 

Overall, I had a great time at Opus and would definitely come back here when I am in the area.",2019-08-28T16:54:18Z,181
46,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"The boutique hotel of the moment. Located in Vancouver's trendy night out district equivalent to New York's meatpacking, the Opus Hotel is your headquarters away from home.

Service is very efficient and the rooms well out-fitted and kept clean by the housekeeping staff.  The gym is compact but has the basics that most people would need on a shorter trip.",2019-04-18T00:18:10Z,181
47,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,Found this hotel through trip advisor and it was a great place. Super helpful staff from the time we booked.

48,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Absolutely delightful. Service was outstanding! Extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff available to answer any of our questions. Our room was small but very well furnished and comfortable. Location, location, location.  Subway entrance was literally across the street and a plethora of fine restaurants to select from were just steps away. And of course the water taxis were a two- minute walk.",2022-05-27T17:24:35Z,181
49,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"This review makes me so sad to write, especially given all the rave reviews this place has.  We didn't have a good experience, and so my review has to reflect that - especially when we stayed at four total hotels in our west coast trip, and the other three (L'Hermitage, Loden and Nita Lake Lodge) were all amazing, making the Opus' issues even more obvious.

I want to start with the positives: the room was great.  They upgraded us to this corner suite - the living room set up was fantastic, the bathroom was dreamy, and the bed was amazingly comfortable.  The view was great.  No complaints room-wise at all.

However, this room was $629+taxes a night.  Total price $777.  SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN DOLLARS.  For that much, I expect great service and an overall fantastic stay.  The other three hotels we stayed at were all less expensive by a lot, and they all provided much, much better service.  The poor service started before we even arrived.  I noted that the email conversations between myself and Opus were not great.  They were slow to respond, if at all, and didn't really answer my questions.  On their website, they claim to have HBO on their TVs, so I called to check (can't miss GOT), and they just said, ""No,"" and that was that, and it still says it on their website.  That was lie #1, in my opinion.  When we checked in, Matthew was the only good service person we encountered the entire time, he upgraded us and was really friendly and overall great.  However, he said our room came with parking or breakfast (seems to be kind of common in Vancouver upscale hotels), so we said breakfast.  He said great, you pay and at check out (we only stayed one night), they would remove it from the bill.  

The next morning we went to this free breakfast, and the service in the hotel restaurant was awful.  It was like no service at all.  We stated we were from the hotel and the guy just took away our menus but didn't tell us what that meant - did we get a choice? was a set breakfast coming? what was in the set breakfast?  As I'm pregnant, I can't eat everything (everything gives me heartburn), and I didn't want them wasting anything on my plate that I didn't want, but we couldn't track anyone down to ask.  Forty-five minutes later, breakfast came, a sad mix of nothingness on a plate.  I asked for ketchup; five minutes later we had to go find someone else to bring us ketchup.  Anyway, my husband paid in full and tipped 20%, and we went to check out, and the guy at the front counter didn't give us an invoice/receipt to look over, he just said have a good day.  

So, of course, they charged us for the breakfast and didn't take it off the room stay even though it was included.  I feel like this was really sneaky, to not let us look it over, and most people wouldn't notice on their VISA bill at that price if something was $40 too expensive.  I had to email in and ask for an invoice, and when they sent it with the breakfast, I had to explain that they should take it off.  No apology, they just sent another invoice - this one didn't SAY breakfast anymore, BUT THE AMOUNT WAS THE SAME.  So they literally just removed the words ""breakfast"" and kept the amount the same.  WTF.  So now I was angry, because you really expect more from a high end hotel.  I had to ask for another invoice, and then I checked my VISA bill - this was 6 business days later, so it should have gone through, but it hadnt been refunded yet.  We were still in Vancouver, staying at a GREAT hotel, and so I walked over there to ask them in person what was up - and even though they claimed they did the refund already, miraculously, it didn't show up until 48 hours later, which would have been 8 full business days since they claimed they made the refund.  In my opinion, that means they didn't do it until I showed up IN PERSON.  (And they offered me nothing in terms of apology or anything, btw, still)  

In the end, that whole experience of having to chase after them for a deal included in my room was exhausting and really ruined the whole thing.  Check your bill in the end, or go to one of the other myriad of amazing choices in Vancouver!",2019-05-10T19:56:22Z,181
50,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Stayed in mid July on a business trip and really loved the experience at the OPUS.

The front desk staff were super helpful and I felt very safe at the hotel (was travelling solo). It's also worth mentioning I don't think I have ever stayed in a hotel that was this clean - amazing!

My bed was oh so comfortable and I really made myself at home during my four night stay.

Ordered room service almost every single morning (so luxurious) and the food was always delicious. Especially loved the freshly baked muffins served with home made jam - YAS!

Was pleasantly surprised by the turn down service - housekeeping would arrive in the early evenings with candies, chilled water, and ice - so nice! 

Little known fact : the hotel offers a complimentary luxury car service that will take you anywhere in downtown Vancouver (first come, first served) which is awesome.

Absolutely would stay here again in a heart beat!!",2017-08-10T17:59:05Z,181
51,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"The first time I came to Vancouver, I stayed in Parc Vancouver and was like meh. Vancouver hotels are pretty pricy and I wanted to give boutique hotels a try. My cousin booked OPUS for our weekend trip to see Ariana Grande. 

Pros:
- The hotel is in Yaletown and is walking distance to Rogers Arena and many other places.
- Right across from Yaletown subway station. 
- OPUS offers free ride to downtown areas. 
- Super friendly staff who actually would do anything to make your life easy. 
- Spacious room.
- Great water pressure.
- Close to many yummy restaurants!!
- Free candies every day.

Cons:
- Yaletown is pretty darn crazy at night during the weekends. If you care about noises, I would skip rooms facing the street.
- The after-hour check-in process is not as pleasant as regular hours. The staff helping me check in was not very familiar with his work. 
- They can be short staffed sometimes.

A few stories to show their amazing service:
1. I was picking up my suitcase after checking out and spending a day in downtown Vancouver. I was hoping for a ride to the train station. I expected them to say no, but they said yes. They even asked me if I want a few bottles of water for my trip. They definitely didn't have to do it. 
2. We had to print out tickets for the show, and headed to dinner after sending the document to the front desk. We came back from dinner and our tickets are already in our room. 
3. We wanted to visit Granville Island and asked for a ride. We had no idea it wasn't in downtown. They also didn't have anyone available to give rides. They called a cab for us and paid the ride. 

Thank you, everyone at OPUS, for making my trip to Vancouver so simple and pleasant. I would recommend this place to everyone who's interested in traveling to Vancouver.",2019-05-17T19:32:37Z,181
52,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"I do enjoy staying in Yaletown when I come visit Vancouver, this hotel was quite nice and glad we chose to stay here. It's located on Davie just after the Hamilton block, the signage isn't the greatest but you will see a Opus Valet sign on the curb or just look for Café Artigiano as that is right next door.  

As we arrived, I pulled up to the valet and went inside as I didn't initially see anyone working the valet area. We unloaded, went in and it was quite busy in there with check-ins/outs and other services for the guest like putting bikes away, grabbing golf clubs from the storage room, tagging bags etc. It calmed down a little and the nice gentleman greeted us and apologized for the wait and was very friendly to help us. We were a little early for check-in but he was able to get us checked-in on the computer, hold our bags for us, take care of the valet and provide any info on the area around like maps, eats, and must sees.  He also provided us two bottles of water and again thanked us for staying with them and apologized again for the wait.  I advised him it was totally fine and in return thanked him for helping us.(felt it was almost a fist-bump moment but I regrettably didn't).

Later when we got into our rooms, we were pretty amazed how nice it was, how comfy the bed looked, cool layout with the bathroom and neat views of the street.  We got the ""King"" room and the bed was super comfy and I was definitely sawing some logs at night.  Bathroom is a shower only, in which I prefer, neat sink layout where you can look out the window or people can see you get ready.  Don't worry, there are blinds you can roll down if you not an exhibitionist like me.  

Hotel is connected to Café Artigiano on one side and La Pentola on the other side. 
Staff around the hotel is very friendly, accommodating, helpful and also provided turndown service when we were out at dinner. Overall, we were very pleased with our stay here and will look for this place as a main option on future trips.",2016-08-19T15:11:12Z,181

54,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"LOVE the pet friendliness. Ada (our 50 lb well-behaved dog) received a warm welcome at the concierge check in. She even got a cute welcoming squeaky plush toy gift waiting in the room (which she's all about) and some dog food and water to get excited about! After a long ride, it made her happy to chow down on a late meal we hadn't plan for. Thanks, Opus!

The lounge downstairs was happening, so is the club around the building (not associated with Opus). There was a long line when we got here around 11pm, and there's a long line now at 1:30am. Must be a popular club we just hadn't looked into. 

Room
Decor is cute, just enough space. Smaller than normal, but perfect the way it is. It's just for sleeping, why hog more space?
Ours is above that aforementioned club, so if you're trying to sleep early on a Friday night, wear ear plugs. 

I'm here to spend time with my favorite persons, hubby and Ada, and it's absolutely perfect. Considering the noise I can hear, I'll have to be careful not to be loud when we're ""doing it"", wink wink. 

My favorite part of this hotel is their eco friendliness. Reusable glasses and water cantina, and the option to launder towels only when necessary. Cool beans!

My other favorite is staff friendliness. They're so welcoming and cheery, and accommodating! :) Welcomed us with two glasses of champagne and two complimentary drink tickets to their lounge. So very nice, we didn't even ask! I love it when boutique hotels do that.  Reminds me of the SLS luxury boutique hotel we staid at in Beverly Hills. Good job, Opus!",2019-10-05T08:44:09Z,181
55,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Pet friendly, super accommodating and welcoming. 

We are from Vancouver but as a treat we booked the penthouse suite for new years eve. We felt welcome as soon as we came in the lobby! 

We hit a hiccup with our dogs though. We had left them at the house, and had dropped in on them to let them out, feed them etc throughout the day. When the NYE festivities picked up though, our pet camera monitoring the dogs was going off with bark alerts every 2 minutes! 

Although we didn't check in with our small pups, I checked with front desk to see if we could pick them up and bring them back to the hotel with us. Turns out our dogs were just as welcome as we were! 

Now we all get to have a cozy NYE. Thanks Opus!",2019-01-01T09:42:10Z,181
56,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"We booked after reading reviews and seeing the photos of the rooms.  We were happy with everything, the hotel represents itself accurately online.  It's not cheap but it's not the most expensive place either.

The hotel staff is super friendly and helpful, from the valet to the front desk to the bartender.  The valet by the way is $45 a night (canadian).  There's some sort of pay lot for $25 around the block, but it was raining and it seemed like a hassle.  This was a lot more convenient, although spendy.  

We were offered champagne upon check-in, which was appreciated.  Bags were sent up to the room, everything was easy and handled.  

Floors in the bathroom are heated.  Swanky.  Love the malin+goetz supplies in the bathrooms, I love hotels that carry those products.  

The bathroom from our street view room is full glass wall to the street.  There is a dual-roller shade, one is a screen shade that gives some privacy during the day, none at night.   And then the other is a blackout shade so you can darken your room for the morning.  

We would stay here again, great area of town (Yaletown).",2018-01-30T03:42:07Z,181

58,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Lovely stay at OPUS! Found this boutique hotel through Hotels.com as I was need to book accommodations for a work trip.

I rented a car for my visit and because it was a hybrid I was given FREE valet!

Check in process was smooth, quick and easy. it was a nice touch to be offered either sparkling wine or water complimentary upon check in.

Given my status with expedia I got a free upgrade with king bed. Room was clean, cute, had a very comfortable bed... Loved the malin and goetz products!!!! I am from NYC so it was a pleasant surprise to see in the bathroom. Also happy they had an espresso machine and although I didnt get anything from the mini bar they had very reasonable prices. 

Staff all around super friendly and helpful here.

First off let me personally give a shout out to Matthew and Collin who made the check in process perfect.  Matthew went above and beyond to make our stay wonderful and unforgettable.  We were provided some bubbly on arrival and even upgraded to the one and only signature suite on the 7th floor.  This room was decked out, had everything you could ever want in a room.  A lounge space, 2 bathrooms, 1 bed, double sided fireplace,  heated floors, jetted tub, and an awesome view with balcony. 

Service was exceptional here.  Nightly turndown service provided some old school candy like pop rocks and push pops that brought back childhood memories. Our room also had a iPad for our use.  They also have a slick white jaguar car brand new that will take you anywhere in downtown area. 

I highly recommend for you to stay at Opus hotel, you can't get the personable service like this anywhere else.  I really want to go back to Vancouver soon and I'll be sure to stay at Opus again.",2016-12-02T06:05:44Z,181

Hotel in partnership with restaurant so we found it unacceptable that this was allowed as it is a RestUrant not a night club. Be warned about loud persons and manAments lack of control .

61,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"When I first saw a thumbnail pic somewhere online, probably Expedia or something, the angle out toward the large window felt rather 'Lost in Translation' (picture the window behind Bill Murray sitting on the bed). Like some ambient chill vibe called out to me. Ok, Daren, get a room.

The building is a nice place. It has neat character being in Yaletown and my room's pastel purple color fits Davie St's culture, I thought, ""Annnd, I'm in Davie Village, yup, haha."" The 707 room is comfy and nice. Interesting features are the glass & blinds partition between the bed space and the shower tub in bathroom, the heated floor, and neat balcony which I think is only on the 7th FL rooms. The floor heat didn't seem to work so I had to call that in, plus it would be nice to have 'on/off' (text, colors, or a light) on the switch. The cable was ok, controls weren't great. Decent space to set things around and/or work. I wasn't quite sure if the climate control was able to get fixed, as well. I didn't really hear - like HEAR hear - it turn on, much less feel the temperature change(s). The housekeeping lady that did come in seemed nice and shared the concern. The WiFi was maybe a B to B+, if I had to grade it; little bit worse in the lobby. Something even weirder I'd never seen before was the door bells on my floor. The first night someone had pressed mine and that actually scared the shit out of me (I mean, wouldn't you jump if you heard a door bell in the middle of the night?). I noticed at least the 7th FL has these and the 2nd FL didn't; weird. Some thing, I guess, eh?

I used the fitness center a bit and was glad they had a water dispenser but disappointed they couldn't fix the hot water in the 3 days I was there (I like to drink warm/room temperature water before/during/after workouts). The thing just sputtered and made weird noises when I used it. Sigh. Everything else seemed solid although I was a bit curious why they also had a full bathroom with tub/shower in there, plus the 2nd FL it's on also had another bathroom in the hallway. I guess it's good to have super convenience for relieving one's self.

The front desk check-in was very pleasant. The kind Asian lady who greeted me got me all set up and had the brightest smile. The others kind of seemed proper yet monotone. Parking around the area may be tough for driving.

Location is great; it's across the street from the Canada Line SkyTrain and a short walk to the awesome vegan spot Zend Conscious Lounge.",2017-11-05T03:12:07Z,181

The hotel itself is beautiful. It is well kept and clean. The staff at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful during the check in process. Loved the sparkling wine when we arrived. Perfect way to start our vacation.

A few minutes after arriving at our room housekeeping came by with a bucket of ice, a carafe of water and some candies. Great service!

The room was great as well. The mini bar is fully stocked with drinks, snacks and other things. It's all expensive, but it's the price you pay for convenience. The beds are extremely comfortable and come with a soft and a firm pillow. The bathroom was large with a spa like tub and the shower had a rain shower head. The shampoo, conditioner and body wash all smelled amazing. The body wash was perfect for a bubble bath after a busy day of hiking in North Vancouver. Also loved the heater underneath the vanity. It was nice to not have to walk on cold tile in the morning or after a shower. The gas fire place was my favourite. I loved turning it on when we walked into the room. It warmed up the area nicely.

The Ipad in the room and the ability to charge your smartphone with the alarm clock is a nice touch, definitely a step above. 

You can rent bikes for free and there is also a complementary car service that will take you anywhere in downtown Vancouver. My husband and I utilized the car service to take us to Rogers Arena for a hockey game. Andre was wonderful. He was chatty, friendly and had both my husband and I laughing. 

The bar area was a nice quiet area to sit and have a drink late in the evening before turning in for the night. 

The restaurant had delicious breakfast options. My husband tried the Opus breakfast with bacon, the omelette and the pancakes. I loved the continental breakfast with the meat, cheese and bagel. I had it every morning. The raspberry jam is so yummy as is the coffee.  

Overall, our stay at the Opus Hotel was above an beyond our expectations. The door was always opened for us, our car was delivered from valet parking quickly and we were made to feel special. The service was exceptional as were the amenities. We will definitely being staying at the Opus Hotel the next time we are in Vancouver.",2018-10-31T19:39:17Z,181
63,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Extremely misleading car service. Super sketchy hotel to advertise on their website ""Complimentary luxury car service from OPUS to any downtown area."" However, on check-in was told only 7 pm to 11 pm. I searched their website and emails and found zero mention of this huge limitation making the service useless for us. I would have booked elsewhere if I didn't think the free car service would make this hotel more affordable (since Vancouver doesn't have Uber/Lyft yet, I would have booked closer to our dining choices)

Yes, their website does say ""*Based on availability at time of request - Offered first come, first served."" I don't mind being told it was full for some of our trips, but having zero availability other than 4 hours each day sucks.

The front desk had zero answer for why they were misleading customers.

I also booked a deluxe room (ie, not their cheapest) directly from their website and only received their 3rd (ie, bad) floor. Don't know if they were being petty after I was surprised by their lack of useful car service.",2017-11-24T01:12:39Z,181
64,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Came here on recommendation.  Super cute and right in the middle of everything.  Id say the only downfall is that theres no pool, but there would literally be no where to put it.  The location is right in the restaurant district...if you were walking, you probably wouldn't even notice the hotel door because of its subtlety.  It has a small bar/lounge next to the lobby which got pretty full and loud on the weekend (so if its raining and you don't want to venture...there ya go??)..also, an attached cafe.  

The vibe is modern, and the bathrooms have a glass wall (with curtain)- not the most private, but we liked it!

Vancouver is pretty tiny- we walked everywhere.  If you're there to eat food and see a game, then its the perfect location.  We wanna come back soon.",2018-02-24T19:25:56Z,181
65,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"The location alone is superb~ It's young and hip, and not crowded with a bunch of tourists. Not only does Opus has its own restaurant/bar, the surrounding area has a variety of food you can pick from: pub food, fast food, Thai sit-down restaurant, sports bar etc. There's even a convenient store next to the hotel. Across from Opus is the subway. Further down the street is a HSBC bank if you're short on cash or need to exchange some USD for some CAD. About 2 blocks down you'll be right at the marina, where there are bike rental shops, grocery store, coffee shop, and restaurants.

The room @ Opus is very trendy. The decor is very vibrant/boutique-like. It's not huge, but definitely not a closet. Speaking of closet, there is one =) That is also where the safe & umbrella is located (which came in handy since it rained). There is a flat screen mounted on the wall. Beneath the TV, there is a CD/Radio/DVD player. The hotel even provides a selection of CDs for you to listen to. Also, for those nights when you are tossing and turning and there is nothing good on TV, the hotel has a collection of DVDs that you can rent to watch (for free). 

There are 2 sliding doors that opens up to a bathroom which has a floor-to-ceiling glass window. There is a copious amount of counter space. The coffee/tea and hairdryer can be found on the counter. The standing shower has a rain-fall type of shower head. All the toiletries (soap, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion) are from L'Occitane. 

But what I love the most about the bathroom is the bathroom floor. I know that sounds strange, but seriously, I do! The floor is heated. It's so amazing~ It might not sound like it's a big deal, but once you experience this type of luxurious flooring, you'll be raving about it too~

Overall, I love this hotel! Can't wait to stay here again when I'm back in Vancouver~",2011-07-27T00:28:34Z,181

67,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"I attended opus bar in Yaletown for Halloween event. I bought the very last ticket for $67. I was expecting a ballroom but this bar is multi-levelled. you have to walk down a long flight of stairs to get to the washrooms that look into the men's in the men's look into the women's. That's a violation of privacy especially when it comes to the bathrooms. You are able to see the men piss in a urinal and see the women fix themselves because there's mirrors all along the wall. The dance space is very little and spread out. I thought there would be a lot more people there was roughly about 60. Definitely not worth paying $67 for especially when most of the guys there were gay or very unattractive and people not dressing up to code attire which was sexy or formal some people dressed in plastic rain jackets and a really old and used sweater to pretend she looks like Red Riding Hood. I say pretend because she has absolutely no resemblance to Red Riding Hood. My expectations were so high because of number one it's Yaletown, number two because it cost me $67 to get in, number 3 because of the strict rule of dress attire they placed on the ticket and website . plus it's a masquerade and a lot of people didn't wear a mask!!!!!! I was charged $12 . 37 for Jagermeister. I was dressed really well and no guy hit on me. The people I told that to were shocked.

Do not attend this place for a Halloween event the only good thing about it is that if you live in Vancouver or Richmond it's good because the Canada line is right across from it.

If I were to host an event people would have to send a picture of what their planning on wearing to make sure dress attire is up to code",2017-10-31T04:17:38Z,181

It's so easy to get to from the airport, a short metro ride and the stop is just feet away from the hotel. It's close by to good food and nightlife that you can reach on foot. We had an upgraded room with a balcony that had great views of downtown.  It's a little on the pricey side as this is a boutique hotel, but totally worth it. Amazing customer service from everyone there, clean rooms, and great location.",2017-07-17T15:56:13Z,181

The room was chic and stylish and amenities were amazingly plenty.  I enjoyed the big bathtub with aromatherapy bath salts.  The subway was just across the street. What more could you ask for?  The breakfast was hearty and the restaurant waitstaff were attentive and nice! If you like fine dining, the row of restaurants across the street would get you pampered.
I'd highly recommend this place even if you're not running for Vancouver marathon, Half or other races!  While I was running through Yaletown towards Stanley Park, I was so tempted to go back to my room and take a hot bath! ha ha ha!",2018-05-08T19:52:08Z,181

Also, the turn down service is amazing. They leave you fun little treats like Pop rings and pop rocks and a jug of water next to your bed. 

The staff and service was simply the best! I would absolutely stay here again. :)",2017-02-02T01:11:21Z,181
75,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"We (my husband and I) were in Vancouver for a wedding, and Opus was one of the designated hotels. I travel a lot for business and normally avoid boutique hotels after a few really bad experiences (mainly poor noise isolation), but this was where everyone else was staying - so I jumped on the bandwagon. Opus completely lived up to all expectations - in a positive way. From before we walked in the door to when we left, the staff were extremely helpful and the hotel/room were gorgeous.

How can staff be helpful before we arrive? I called from the airport asking about a shuttle. They don't have one, but the staff member gave directions to the metro (which is in the airport terminal) and has a drop literally in front of the hotel. He explained (twice) the exact stop that I would need to take and what type of ticket I would need to purchase. 

When we arrived, we were offered champagne or water. It was great to be offered both while checking in. I was exceptionally thirsty. 

Perhaps most important: our room was immaculate. And silent. And the bed was comfortable. And the shampoo/conditioner smelled amazing. (My husband is still trying to find the vendor.)",2017-07-09T17:09:03Z,181
76,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Stayed at Opus Hotel last weekend on pure accident. AirBnB fell through and we had to find a place to stay last minute. Holy cow! I could not recommend The Opus Hotel more! It was absolutely amazing! 

The service was top notch. The staff was so friendly and helpful! They recommended really great restaurants and sights to see in Vancouver. (Matthew and Toby are the two names that stand out.) There also is a car service (first come-first serve basis) that will take you anywhere downtown and was a lifesaver when we were trying to catch the bus to Capilano Suspension Bridge Park (another Vancouver must-see at least once.) 

The room was so clean and spacious. I love the colorful design - it is such a fun atmosphere! I also really appreciated the black out curtains. The bathroom was stunning - the tub was epic. There are heated floors too which was luxurious, and the included toiletries are very good. I especially liked the rum Malin+Goetz ones. The room was quiet at night and had a very comfortable bed. Best sleep I have had while traveling! 

You also could not ask for a better location! Lots of shops and restaurants nearby. There is also a train stop nearby and lots of access to busses. Vancouver has great public transportation and it is relatively cheap. We did not try the restaurant connected to the hotel, but we did try the bar and it too was a cool atmosphere. It was fun without being too overwhelming. There is a great selection of drinks available and I did see a few food menus for snacks. 

Overall, it was an amazing stay and I would definitely rebook there!",2018-04-11T20:37:52Z,181
77,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,The hotel is beautiful and the location is great but I am absolutely disappointed about the huge noise level in our room facing the street. I understand it is a city hotel but I have slept in many big city hotels and have never experienced that much noise in my room. For an expesnive hotel like this I would expect a better sound protection with the windows. Our whole vacation has been ruined from lack of sleep.,2019-08-31T08:47:08Z,181
78,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"If you are going to Vancouver, the Opus is where you want to stay.  It's centrally located downtown in Yaletown (the Tribeca/Soho of Vancouver) and set amongst converted warehouses housing design stores, restaurants and boutiques.  It's a few blocks from the water and an easy water taxi ride to Granville Island,   The rooms are modern and well-designed, and done in color themes (we were green).  The beds are amazingly comfortable, offering the right combo of support and fluff.

it's not just what the Opus offers in terms of aesthetics that set it apart - it's the amenities.  At US $300+, those are very important, and we were very pleased with what we got.  Being that Vancouver is a bike-friendly city, many people rent bikes - but the hotel offers them for free.  And not just any bikes - fabulous black Cruisers, the same kind I wish I had back home!  The also offer a car service around town, in their BMW 7-series cars - very swank.  We took advantage of it every chance that we got, and arrived at our destinations in style (especially nice when you are going to dinner across town in your prettiest heels and it's raining).

Be sure to check out the AMAZING list in the room portfolio for any extras you may need.  Staple gun?  No problem.  Microwave?  Coming right up.  Step ladder?  Sure, we'll be right there.

The staff is extremely nice, and will give you great recommendations to help you navigate the city. 

The bar/lounge gets very loud and kind of cheesy on weekend nights (think of the Standard Hotel in West Hollywood), but once you are in your room, it's a distant memory.

I'm now like one of those people in the cruise ships commercials, staring wistfully out the window as I remember when I was pampered and spoiled at the Opus.  Sigh!",2008-08-09T16:04:36Z,181
79,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Our stay at OPUS Vancouver Hotel was amazing!  And I don't mean normal amazing like ""these chicken wings are amazing"" amazing.  I mean full-on Webster's ""to affect with great wonder and astonishment"" amazing!

Being a non-Canadian, I did not know that parking your car in the street while you checked in was acceptable.  So, I left my wife in the car in the alley beside the hotel while I went inside to find out what I should do.  When I told the front desk I was there to check-in and wondered where I should park, they immediately overwhelmed me with their hospitality and efficiency.  Within what seemed like seconds, the car was parked in the secure underground garage, my bags were by the elevator, my wife was next to me, and we both had a glass of champagne in our hands.  Not a bad welcome from a hotel we booked using a Groupon!

Speaking of Groupon; it afforded us to book a $280 per night room for $195.  The offer also included a $40 breakfast voucher, but did not include the $35 parking fee.  That seemed high, but I understand it's typical for Vancouver.

While we sipped our champagne, the concierge offered us some upgrades.  I believe there were four levels, the highest being the corner penthouse suite for an additional $150.  He explained the regular rate for this was over $1200 per night.  Imagine my shock, when my wife looked at me over her glass of champagne and smiled, and then told the man, ""We'll take it!"" 

They immediately comp'ed the parking and Internet fees.

I'm just a simple guy.  I've never seen anything like this room except maybe in a movie.  I would think David Bowie or (for you younger Yelpers) Lady Gaga would be at home in this room if they visited Vancouver!

Here's a list of the room's amentias from the OPUS Vancouver website:

- Dramatically furnished in one unique décor
- 645 sq ft (60 sq metres) in area
- Distinctive corner suites equipped with living room area with large sectional sofa, Bang & Olufsen stereo with cd library, LCD TV, Satellite, PVR, and DVD player, adjoining powder room, wet bar and bedroom area featuring chrome four poster King bed
- Adjoining luxurious bathroom with oversized jetted soaker tub with panoramic exterior window and separate walk-in shower
- A two-sided fireplace warms the living room and the bedroom
- Floor-to-ceiling windows, wraparound balcony and sweeping views of downtown Vancouver, mountains and False Creek
- Available on 7th floor only, 2 Penthouse Suites in total.

I can attest; all these were there, and more! (see my pictures)

It was a very decadent night!

The next morning, the new front desk crew was just as helpful and attentive.  After an outstanding $50 breakfast in the hotel restaurant (remember the $40 voucher) the front desk assisted us in planning our day of Vancouver sightseeing.  They told us what was worth seeing and how to best get to it.  Even though we were checking out, they offered to hold our bags and car until the evening.  They even offered us the hotel's bikes and helmets to use for the day!

When we returned after our day of successful sightseeing; as if by magic, our bags, our car, ice cold bottled water and turn-by-turn directions back to the U.S. border appeared.  It was a nice ending to our amazing stay at the OPUS Vancouver Hotel!",2011-09-07T04:53:07Z,181

I'm not sure where it is rated on Tripadvisor in Vancouver but I got a great deal off of Jetsetter and knew that I wanted to stay here to enjoy the city. This is located in Yaletown district literally across the street from a mile of little boutique shops, restaurants, bars, etc. The night life here is unbeatable and the onsite restaurant is not too shabby.

The bar at night is a little weird and creepy for me though, their menus are on the wall and they play internet mimi's (is that how it's spelled?) everywhere.

The beds are superb, the showers are superb, the toiletries are superb. What isn't? They offer free champagne or water upon check in, although everything in Vancouver takes about five years so expect a long wait when you're checking in.

The fitness center is nice, the business center has free internet and every room has an iPod dock that the maids make sure to turn onto nice pleasant music for your return. They even gave us treats every single night in the form of candies, cookies, fresh water, etc. Sigh, simply wonderful.",2011-02-18T20:09:42Z,181

It's conveniently located - walking distance to many restaurants and bars, adjacent to a subway station, and a stone's throw from an Aquabus dock - yet pleasantly removed from the heart of the touristy downtown waterfront. The staff is super friendly and responsive. Upon checking in, I received a text from my ""personal concierge,"" Ivy, who offered to help with anything we needed during our stay. She found us a sailboat to rent for a day and provided lots of helpful guidance. The rooms are well designed and very clean, with expansive bathrooms and terrific showers (good water pressure), comfy beds and nice amenities like Dyson hairdryers and a carafe of drinking water delivered each night. We had great breakfasts each morning at the restaurant (highly recommend the granola), which is a bright space with friendly staff, and the hotel bar was nice for a nightcap. Last but not least, Opus is noteworthy for its sustainable practices, from providing bulk products in the shower rather than single-use plastic bottles, glasses and water carafes in the room rather than plastic, to encouraging guests' reuse of their towels.

All of the staff were really friendly and enjoyable to work with. The front desk offered us a glass of champagne when we arrived and waited for our room to finish being cleaned, which didn't take long. Our room was very nice and we enjoyed having a colorful room. Unfortunately, it was on the second floor so we could hear some noise from some the bars restaurants nearby. There is an iPad in every room, which is nice feature to have available, but we didn't use it. The king size bed was really comfortable and we slept like rocks.

We only had two complaints. One is that the place is difficult to find. The address is correct, but there isn't much of a street presents. We ended up driving past it a couple of times before we noticed the small sign they had out front. Second is that there was not an outlet near the mirror in the bathroom, which made it a little difficult for my wife to straighten her hair.

I can see us staying here again if we are in the area. It is a little on the pricey side, but definitely not the most expense we saw. If you are looking for a hotel in downtown Vancouver, I definitely recommend staying here.",2014-08-24T00:07:30Z,181

Okay, so maybe that is just wishful thinking on my part. :)

In any case, the Opus in Vancouver is a great place. Beautiful boutique design with bold colors and minimalist style.

- Is located right near the water, walking distance to great restaurants, juice bar, coffee shops, bike rentals, shopping
- They host cool events like Bollywood night and hotel guests get complimentary admission
- A+ on the complimentary L'Occitane shower products
- Lollipop on my pillow one night... Pez dispenser the next
- Desk was nice and big with easy outlet access
- Bed was very comfortable and the room was pristine
- Lots of mirrors of various sizes are scattered throughout the room and bathroom... so I could gaze upon myself in natural light, in artificial light, up close, far away, from behind, etc. Hey, how youuu doin'?

- Bonus for the voyeuristic: our bathroom was wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling windows that let in some wonderful light during the day.

In addition, there was only a thin frosted glass sliding partition for the bathroom; a set up that is not for the faint of heart. Then again, perhaps you're ready to take your relationship to the next level? Funny, you do a #2 and suddenly you're at level #84 of human intimacy.

Speaking of decor -- the room bathroom was the sexiest thing I have ever seen. I submitted some photos, so go check it out. 

The staff is incredibly personable, helpful, and attentive. I think that's honestly what takes it to the top. The valets are incredibly quick to your car, taking items out before you can even step out and close the driver door. They're equally as quick in obtaining your car and bringing it to the front, they offer an umbrella for the day, and directions to wherever you're going. 

The housekeeping staff was top notch. The room looked immaculate each night when I entered after turn-down service, and a new and different item laid on my bed: chocolate, lolly-pop, pez dispenser. And a nicely well done handwritten card for the next day's weather was next to the bed with a carafe of water.

We were getting married at Brix & Mortar over February long weekend and booked the Signature Suite for five days over our wedding weekend. The suite is absolutely gorgeous and huge. I especially appreciated the huge bathroom with the soaker tub. Kaitlyn the event coordinator was great at communicating with me ahead of time to set everything up, including getting a block rate for the guests of the wedding. The customer service at the Opus is out of this world - seriously, every request we made (high stools for make up, extra shampoo, etc.) there'd be a knock at the door in under 5 minutes with the item. Their bathroom products are also high quality - usually I'm so picky I just stick with my own products while staying in hotels but I loved the products they keep at the Opus. We also had some great meals at La Pentola downstairs. An added bonus is that they are pet friendly. The location also couldn't be more convenient - it's right across the street from the Yaletown Roundhouse Station which is less than half an hour away from YVR and it's within walking distance of a ton of restaurants and shops in Yaletown. There's also David Lam Park and False Creek within a 5 minute walk for those bringing their dogs. I can't wait to return here!",2020-12-18T22:48:50Z,181
91,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Opus, you are indeed the best hotel I have ever been to.

Back in October, my boyfriend and I bought a groupon for Opus and stayed the weekend after my birthday. We travel from Seattle, so while it isn't that far, it is still a nice getaway. We fell in love with the posh interior, the amazing service, and yaletown! What an adorable neighborhood!

Well, as soon as we were heading home, I made sure to follow @OpusHotel on twitter to follow what was going on at this lovely spot. Jeremy, the social marketing coordinator responded to my follow right away, followed me, and let me know to let him know the next time we needed a place to stay in Yaletown.

Cut to present day. My boyfriend and I haven't been able to have a romantic weekend away in awhile, so we decided to spend the weekend before valentines with our good friends at Opus. We decided to go big and get an executive king suite and Jeremy got us free wi-fi, late check out and a food and beverage credit! Talk about taking care of your customers! 

Walking into Opus always makes me feel extremely chic. The modern decor is incredible and our taste exactly. I love the magenta and gold seating. Our concierge was nice enough and commented ""oh, you're in the penthouse"" while we were checking in. We didn't think much of it, what do we know? As we jumped in the purple lit elevator we realized we were on the top floor and both got instantly excited. 

Opening the door was a new experience entirely. Wow. The black velvet wall paper, magenta and gold pillows, fire place that can be viewed from the living or bed rooms all were incredible...but the bathroom, oh man. The bathtub, while large and jetted, overlooked yaletown. What an incredible view. You better believe I utilized that tub and the complimentary L'Occitane products!! Jeremy also left us a bottle of wine, some snacks, and a nice note letting us know if we needed anything he was available. I popped open the wine and my boyfriend started playing w the complimentary iPad 2 that is now available in every room. 

Jeremy also got us reservations at Coast (review to follow) on a busy Saturday night. Coast was recommended by the concierge last time we were there and we fell in love with it. The next morning, after a restful sleep in the comfortable king sized bed, we decided we didn't want to leave, so we cancelled our reservations at Cento Notti for brunch (we will try it next time, right?) and ordered room service. This room was simply too amazing to leave if we didn't have to!

Every step of the way was a delight with Opus. I recommend this hotel to everyone I know and we will be returning soon...we just don't know how we can ever settle for an average hotel room again! We were spoiled this weekend for sure...thank you, Jeremy and the rest of the staff at Opus! You made our weekend truly special.

Update: we spent Valentine's Day weekend with Opus this year and once again, awesome service! Thank you Ben and Nathan for the superior service. We love visiting this hotel.",2015-02-16T04:58:24Z,181
92,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"I stayed here for my birthday a few years back but felt the need to review it due to the exceptional service. 

I learned about Opus through an Internet booking service and it had such a great nightly rate that I couldn't refuse. Upon visiting their website I knew I had to stay in the ""Soda Popinski"" themed room. 

Upon arrival I was immediately offered something to drink and the porter asked if he could take my luggage to my room. The check in service was quick and I didn't have to wait. I was brought to my room and was told about the amenities offered. I was made aware of the maître'd service and was told how to contact them if required. 

My room was very clean and tastefully decorated. By for the coolest place I have ever stayed! Very modern colours and the art on the wall was what made it for me! A portrait of Soda Popinski! For those of you who don't know who he is, he was a character in Nintendo's ""Mike Tyson's Punch Out"". Total nerd alert! 

Another great thing that Opus had to offer was an iPad mini to use while staying with them. Really handy when you're trying to navigate around the city or find somewhere to eat that's close enough to walk to! 

If I need a place to stay in Vancouver again, I will certainly consider Opus Hotel again!",2014-09-21T16:51:11Z,181
93,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"We took the train in from the airport, which dropped us off right in front of our hotel. We were simply amazed how helpful the attendant in the train station was, in assisting us with negotiating the whole ticketing and getting on the correct train. We already are in love with Canadians. 

The Opus in Yaletown, the best place to be in BC. The room was decorated in a cool modern decor, a wee bit on the smaller side, but very comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, and plan to return again sometime very soon.",2016-08-19T01:18:09Z,181

95,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Opus is best. Best best best.

This is an inside joke at work when picking hotels to visit our Vancouver team. But honestly Opus is the best. One of the managers likes this more old world hotel that was a couple blocks farther to the office and honestly not as nice. Meanwhile my manager suggested that I book this hotel instead, and it is basically kiddy corner away from our office, newly renovated and extremely comfortable to stay in. 

When you arrive, they provide you with either bottled water or champagne, and once you get into the room you have an iPad waiting for you that you can borrow.

The best detail is that when you step into the bathroom there is a switch to turn on the heated tiles. Heated bathroom tile switch, you are amazeballs, I can't tell you how much I love you enough. 

The beds were plush and comfy, artwork interesting and I like how each day the maids would leave candy on the bed for you to consume. Yay I had missed gorging on pop-rocks from my childhood. 

The location is also great because it's a short walk across the street to a strip of bars in Yaletown. 

The fitness center was open late night based on your room key. One night after a late cocktails session I decided to go for a run at midnight and it was available, well, until this thin odd Chinese guy with glasses came in and pretended to use the equipment as I was running. This triggered me to promptly complete my run to escape prying eyes. 

Nevertheless, really great stay here and...

Not the cheapest place in the world, but definitely not the most expensive. I think their rates were very fair.
The hotel is situated in an area of town that I can only describe as douche ville or yuppy central. Not my ""scene"".

We pulled up to the hotel for valet parking where no one greeted us, We unloaded our luggage and checked in, The front desk clerk was very friendly and she took my keys to give to the valet. The next day I called for the car. We loaded our luggage again when I noticed some bumper damage on my car. Ben the hotel room manger came out to look at it. He did apologize and took pictures. He was helpful at the moment and said he would communicate with me. I have received one e-mail pretty much saying, we are not responsible for any car damages.

So I tried getting a refund or even a rebooking but that request was denied. I was very disappointed with this establishment not having any sympathy for the crisis going on and not giving me any leniency on the situation. I was forced to miss my reservation and yet these people still unapologetically take my money without any goods or services given.

101,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Really sweet hotel.  I am not sure I would stay anywhere else if I was coming for a short visit to Vancouver.  The hotel is conveniently located about one block from their light rail system.  So it costs $8.50 to get from the airport to the hotel.  

The hotel is located in the heart of Yaletown.  It is a cute lofty area, with good restaurants, fun bars and lots of shopping.  The hotel is also in walking distance of some other great areas.  Kitslano beach is about a 25 minute walk.

The rooms are comfortable and average sized.  They have updated bathrooms, iPod alarm clocks, and a well stock mini bar.  The hotel has an adequate gym and a bar and restaurant in the lobby.

The staff was great.  They were very friendly and extremely helpful (although I suspect everyone in Canada might be).  I will definitely stay there again.",2010-08-17T02:11:30Z,181

Nice touches inside the rooms including iPad and top notch products in the bathrooms. Rain showerhead was nice. Located in Yaletown, a nice walking neighborhood with shop and restaurants around. 

Would definitely come back again for a stay. Only a couple negatives. Room and hotel itself were a little smaller than expected. There was a linen closet right next to our room that kept being open and shut while staff were going in an out that made it a little noisy but after one call to the front desk, that stopped and was no longer an issue.",2012-11-23T17:31:57Z,181

106,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"This was probably the best overall experience I had at a hotel. I stayed there as an organizer of a bachelor party event, from which I organized 12 guests to stay at the opus.

First and Foremost, I was working with Camilla, who was the group coordinator. She was absolutely excellent - accommodating, flexible, thorough and extremely hospitable. My group had changes and special requests and she handled each one with grace. Also, I loved the special detail that she provided - each morning we received special hand written notes from her and a special care package for each room. Just dealing with Camilla leading up to the Canada added to the excitement and experience.

Second, the entire staff was wonderful. From Z and Sahil (apologized for the spelling of the actual names) who checked us in to the actual cleaning staff, each person was incredibly helpful. We received champagne upon check in, and when my party was waiting for a car in the lobby, they were offered complementary wine. My group was from Los Angeles so we were wondering if all of Canada was this nice!

Third, the facilities were very clean, modern and artistic. Each room has an ipad, we used a few car service and the heated bathroom floors were awesome.

Finally, the staff was very flexible and patient with us. Upon returning one night late, we were a bit too noisy, yet the staff was very patient. They gave us a gentle warning but still did understand where we were coming from.

I absolutely recommend Opus to anyone who wants to feel pampered, have a great time and meet a wonderful staff.",2016-01-25T17:22:22Z,181

I arrived in late in the evening and was greeted warmly by the staff who offered me a glass of rosé. They even took my room service order while I checked in so that I wouldn't have to wait for it. 
The entire week I was there, all the staff was really helpful and gracious. As an added plus: each time the room was cleaned I was treated to a new type of candy:) who doesn't like candy after a long day? 
The restaurant next door (La Pentola) also serves a wonderful menu and I highly recommend it.

I cant say enough about the service here. Easily the best service I have ever received at a hotel! The staff was so helpful and friendly even though we must have asked a hundred things of them. Didn't even feel like they were trying too hard, just genuine friendly people. Located in Yaletown, very close to Rodney's Oysters and Hapa Izakaya, which are both great spots that we visited. The hotel has car service if you request it ahead of time and that saved us cab fare a couple times. They also have free bikes for rent which is great because it is only 5 mins to the water and then maybe another 10-15 mins ride to Stanley Park. The only downside I can think of is that the hotel does not have a pool, but i did not care too much about that.",2017-11-20T20:03:54Z,181

114,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"While doing our research for lodgings in Vancouver, every guidebook, magazine article, blog, and personal referral pointed us to the Opus Hotel. Touted as one of the city's top boutique hotels, it's also known as quite a hot spot for the night scene. So although we really loved staying at the Loden downtown, we decided to change hotels after coming back to Vancouver  from Whistler. With such glowing recommendations, it was well worth checking out if only to verify whether all the hype was true or not.

The Opus Hotel garners 5 stars because it definitely has its good points but it was very different from what I was anticipating. It was a little more modern, a little trendier, and younger feeling than the Loden, but there was a perhaps a little less polish and refinement to it. The staff is amazingly nice- for some reason I always figure service at boutique hotels would be a little aloof but everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) was so nice and helpful. 

The rooms are well outfitted and I loved that our room had a separate shower and bathtub. I also appreciated the verbena scented L'OCCITANE bath products since I could actually use them. All floors are private so you can only access them with a room key you insert into a slot in the elevator. There's a business room on the second floor with complimentary wi-fi and printer although wifi is also available in your room for a charge (there's a Starbucks directly across the street from the hotel where the wi-fi is free as well). There's also a gym on the second floor which is pretty small but completely serviceable. They have a mini fridge with complimentary bottles of water as well as apples for an after work-out snack I guess. The gym is in the corner of the floor and has three sides of floor length windows which can be both cool and unnerving since you can watch everyone on the street as you work out but they can see you as well. 

The hotel's location is fantastic since it's in Yaletown and the waterfront is just steps away. There's also an Urban Fare Market (Canada's version of Whole Foods) on the same street which is a nice place to mosey through and grab a cup of coffee (there's actually a coffee bar attached to the lobby of the hotel but for some reason we never made use of it). The hotel is also walking distance to lots of cool shops and restaurants including the well-known Blue Water Grill. The Skytrain entrance is also just across the street and it will take you directly to the airport- super fast and super convenient.

The Opus Hotel is definitely a fabulous place to stay with lots of amenities and a prime location to boot. I'm glad we made the decision to check into a second hotel to get a better feel of what Vancouver had to offer. I'd wholeheartedly recommend this place as a great place to stay while you explore this beautiful city that captured my heart.

115,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Yikes.  The hotel gods were not shining on us this week-end.  We stayed one night at the Opus and were MISERABLE.  Room was OK, lobby and staff were OK. Valets were great.  

But we got booked into rm 205. What a nightmare.  Techno House music all night long until 330am. We were right above their night club.  Ridiculous! I dont know how anyone who could ethically book someone into this room.  Its not fair to guests to be a night club and a hotel - or at least not fair to those guest staying above the night club. That is just not right.

There are plenty of other hotels in the city - I would recommend those. If you have to stay here, stay away from the second floor.

What a miserable experience and one I had to pay for.",2009-04-20T01:28:49Z,181
116,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"I visit Vancouver frequently for work, and this is my first choice of places to stay while there.

Location is excellent. It's opposite the Yaletown Roundhouse SkyTrain station, so I can take the train directly from the airport and be there in about half an hour. It's also a great location for restaurants (Rodney's Oyster House is next door), and for walking. I particularly like walking down to the waterway and along to the science museum. The restaurant in the hotel itself is also good.

The staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean, comfortable, modern and pleasant. Amenities are good. It has a few unusual quirks which add to the appeal (including the assorted candies left on the bed at night.

117,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Highly overrated. I'm sure at one time, when Yaletown was up and coming and ""all the rage"" that this place was the bomb. Those days have passed and so has the Opus. The bed was uncomfortable, poor layout in the bathroom... the fitness room was small and ill equipped. I asked the ""concierge?"" to get us a reservation at a restaurant, I could see by her facial expression she was out of her element. I stood before her as she called and she hung up and told me ""sorry, they're booked"" ...Ha! I got on my phone 5 minutes later, called and got a table, easily! 
The best part of this hotel is the bellmen, they're young, helpful and friendly. Other than that, this place is tired and has seen it's best day... years ago.",2009-12-19T21:00:47Z,181
118,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Maybe my experience was the exception, but Opus didn't come off nearly as well as it did for the other reviewers.

I stayed at Opus for one night on business. I booked the room based on the hotel's location downtown and its proximity to great food and design shops (a passion of mine).

I pulled up my rental car in front of the hotel to be greeted by... nobody. No valet, and no bellman.

We took our bags inside to check in. The girl at the front desk exuded this you're-privileged-to-simply-be-here vibe. 

After we checked in (which took longer than it did at nearly every other hotel I've ever been to), we had to wait for the valet to get our car parked, lest it be towed for sitting in front of the hotel too long.

Service was NOT the prime goal of the staff.

The hotel's design is very hip, from the Egg Chairs in the lobby to the subway tiles in the bathroom, but the overall feel lacked authenticity. The furniture in the room was IKEA-grade pressed fiberboard - great for your first apartment, but not fit for a hotel of this prestige. 

The window from the room into the shower? Cheesy.

120,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"Trendy hotel in Yaletown with convenient access to Canada Line and restaurants.

Boutique hotel in Vancouver that reminds me of the Kimpton hotel chain.  Modern decor, louder bar and restaurant, caters to traveling adults and couples (no kids in sight!)

What I'm a fan of:
- water or wine upon check in
- l'occitane toiletries and waterfall shower
- complimentary iPad with 3G (since I'm not sure if wi-fi is complimentary or not here)
- nice linens
- rooms are a good size and comfortable
- decent catering for meetings

What I didn't like:
- bed is a bit too firm
- limited fitness centre - they only have one of each type of machine and they're a little older (no individual TVs or iPod connector)
- soundproofing could be improved
- no loyalty points

This is a great hotel to stay at if you're here for business or pleasure.  It has a fun trendy vibe and caters to a yuppie type crowd.  It makes my top 10 list of places to stay in downtown Vancouver and a solid pick if you need to be in Yaletown.",2013-03-02T00:21:19Z,181

The superior room was very cozy, impeccably clean, and the bathroom was sexy with heated floors.  The room's concept was all red, which created an alluring atmosphere.  The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on ever.  I enjoyed the L'Occitane bathroom products; their citrusy body wash was a great pick me up. 

However, the only thing I did not enjoy was the ""free"" breakfast buffet at the Pentola which consisted of stale fruit, convenience store cheap bread and sugar filled ""fruit"" juices.  It was so awful that I took one bite of each and then I left.  Service was non-existent, except for the customers who were paying from the Ala Carte menu.  

Not as spectacular nor memorable as the Fairmont Pacific Rim, but perhaps the best hotel if you are looking to stay in Yaletown.",2013-10-16T01:31:35Z,181
122,OPUS Hotel Vancouver,4.3,"I wanted to give more than four stars, I really, really, did...BUT there is one thing that annoys me more than anything when it comes to Hotels. RAIN SHOWERS. 
It cracks me up knowing these hotels are hoping to conserve water with a no pressure drip drip type of spa-rain head but ironically the person who had this idea must have had NO hair! Because i am nearly sure my HOUR long shower trying to get shampoo and conditioner out of my hair is Not conserving any less water. 

Now that I got that point across.... I love the little hotel book they have in the rooms with fictional characters recommending all types of restaurants and stores. The service is really good and  the location seems perfect for walking and browsing shops and food. Also, the bed is comfy and I slept like a rock. The complimentary BMW service is a nice touch as well. :-D

A tip.......the bathroom wall is full windows to the street with two different blinds for privacy. Be careful you don't close the inner blind only thinking the window is totally covered.

124,The Burrard,4.0,"A 50s style motor lodge that's been kind of tricked out, brought up to date for modern times yet retains some of that vintage vibe. LOVE IT. We stayed 4 days recently and also got other family members a room for 3 days. Love the small, intimate and cozy nature of the lodge, the quiet rooms and best of all, King size beds. Plenty of outlets for electronic gear and a refridgerator.

The second floor has a fire pit with plenty of space to sit around and evenings after dinners out we found ourselves enjoying the warmth of the fire and the lights (not to be missed) and palm trees behind the area.

Just off the lobby in the hotel is The Elysian, a superb espresso shop with snacks and light sandwiches. Some of the best coffee in the area was to be found here.

The staff is spot on service oriented, friendly, and a real pleasure to be around.

Bottom line: this is a great place to stay and is close to Davie street which has a lot of great places to eat, bars and small shops. Love this place, very highly recommended.",2023-09-20T01:56:32Z,119

126,The Burrard,4.0,"Would ya look at this joint? Full of classic history right smack dab in the mid-20th century, the recent management reinvigorated the sweet retro cool vibe of that era with enough modern flair to continue serving the masses. What I really dig is that none of the gaudy features of that era rolled over here. The interesting & indeed the appealing features of those good ol' times were the uniquely cool vertical, horizontal & geometric styles; coupled with slick cursive penmanship in ""centerpiece"" writing/names and ohhh baby, what a zinger(!). Also, that interior courtyard space is quite the vibe; it must be super charming during non-Winter seasons. Great location downtown.

The front staff were cordial & friendly. Nice surprises that may not be noticeable during bookings are discounts to local businesses. I asked about onsite amenities and, while minimal, they were happy to share day passes to a local gym (which I totally used) are available daily.

My room was fairly small & economical with compact bathroom but quite fine to make it work. The bed texture was fairly good, the recessed flatscreen TV with shelf ledge and view of the hospital holiday lights across the street were night highlights. One main ding I'd say is the unexpected bump at the door; I've almost tripped on it more than once (maybe a thumb height).",2023-01-15T06:38:32Z,119
127,The Burrard,4.0,"Posting this everywhere I can find in hopes it reaches management since all emails appear to go straight to the front desk.

James at the front desk is so ridiculously rude. The website states to email for a price match. I found and booked a lower refundable price through Agoda, and emailed the hotel direct as per their instructions. James has done nothing but argue about it, tell me it doesn't include taxes even though it clearly states it does, argue about it being refundable even though it clearly states it is. He refused to listen to me even after I called to discuss and rudely ended the call.

All I was trying to do was book directly with the hotel according to THEIR price match process, but I'm now cancelling my reservation entirely and booking elsewhere. Do not stay here.",2024-01-19T02:27:46Z,119

129,The Burrard,4.0,"A little over priced, but it was worth it. 

The Burrard is definitely quite a boutique hotel,  it's very obvious this is an older property that has been renovated; but its been done so fabulously.  

The hotel is located downtown and in a perfect location for walking distance from all the popular nightlife.  The staff were extremely friendly upon check in and even let me check in early.  The price is a bit on the steep side but is very comparable to the hotels in the area.  They give complementary bikes to ride around town, and the rooms are very clean and comfortable. The Nespresso coffee machine in the room was very convenient & the courtyard was extremely comfortable with a fireplace to lounge by!

They also allow pets for a fee, however I was not charged for my puppers.  Overall I would definitely recommend The Burrard! Will definitely return!",2022-07-12T01:55:31Z,119
130,The Burrard,4.0,"The Burrard was the perfect choice for our quick little getaway to Vancouver. The location is great--many shops and restaurants nearby to explore.

The staff are friendly and knowledgeable-- in particular, Rachelle at the front desk.  ELsa was our attentive floor attendant.  She was extremely helpful directing us to the different amenities that the hotel has (i.e. microwave, washer/dryer).  She also helped us with extra towels.",2022-05-24T11:33:46Z,119
132,The Burrard,4.0,"Stayed here from the period of Oct 30 - Nov 2nd 2021.

Had booked 2 rooms. One room in the corner with two beds and one room in the middle which was 1 king bed. 
The formation style of the room was different the King room has a tub and the 2 bed room had a walk in shower type of thing. Depending on your preference mine is the with the tub, put that into consideration before booking or Request.
The location was nice right in downtown and walkable distance to everywhere. Note that its right next to the Sheraton Wall Centre if ever lost. But be aware that is right across from the hospital where there is a lot of sketchy people lying outside. The hotel has a a feature where they lock all doors after midnight to not let those people walk in and cause a Ruckus which happened quite a number of times. 
The front desk was very pleasant and easy to check in. Note they only have ONE elevator so the stairs was not bad as there was only 4 floors. Our rooms were on the 4th floor so treking up and down the stairs was an ok for us. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. I would stay here again A+++",2021-11-29T20:56:45Z,119
133,The Burrard,4.0,"I love The Burrard! Very clean rooms, quality linens, fun decor, excellent staff and a beautiful courtyard. Despite the central downtown location, it is surprisingly quiet (the air conditioner helped mask street sounds at night though). Environmentally friendly products used and economical rates. Cafe next to the lobby if your in-room Nespresso machine can't quite keep up with your caffeine intake requirement! I will definitely recommend and would stay here again.",2016-04-03T16:43:58Z,119

136,The Burrard,4.0,"Amazing hotel! Great location and welcoming staff. Monica from the front desk was exceptionally friendly, professional and helpful. She anticipated all our requests before we had to ask for them and made the stay extra special. All in all a good place to stay while visiting Vancouver. Free bikes, free wifi, complimentary candy and comfortable beds - a tourist couldn't ask for more!",2016-02-18T16:51:46Z,119
137,The Burrard,4.0,Wonderful welcoming reception.  Ross at the desk was gracious and pleasant. Wonderful location and comfy beds with lots of pillows. We had damp weather so weren't able to take advantage of the cute courtyard seating. We'll be back!!!,2018-01-06T05:53:31Z,119
138,The Burrard,4.0,"Super disappointed with my recent stay at The Burrard.  After circling the hotel for about half an hour we finally found somewhere to park (as the parking lot for the hotel is gated up in the back).  After dealing with a receptionist that had little to no interest in his job, we arrived in our room, which had a full pee stain ON THE BED.  We were quickly switched to another room without any apologies or even admitting the mistake.  
After attempting to push that all aside we arrived in a new room that was equally as disgusting (bathroom door covered in bodily fluids as well as on the ""decorative"" pillows).  We then decided to just spend the short amount of time we had in the city outside of the hotel and asked the receptionist whom had 0 interest in helping anyone, told us to take a cab to Pacific Centre as ""it is very far away"" and then realized it is only 4 blocks away!  Needless to say - we won't be staying here ever again.",2017-12-31T22:15:20Z,119
139,The Burrard,4.0,"Cute hotel in a easy area of Vancouver. I give it less stars as they charge you $20 plus tax which is like 25% !! so it comes to $25 for parking. I hate places that charge you for parking even though you paid for a hotel room there! I feel like this is cheap and cheeky! My window was broken and wouldn't close so my room was freezing, I called someone up and they got it to shut but it wasn't functioning so I couldn't open it again if we got hot. I feel like the maid should have noticed this before giving it to guests. This place is ok, not the best I've been to. I feel like this place used to be worn down and someone came in and splashed a bunch of paint and tried hard to revamp it. The small room didn't bother me as I have been living in Europe for 6 years and this is nothing compared to some rooms I've seen in europe. I like the funky retro feel of this hotel.",2014-10-03T19:22:30Z,119
140,The Burrard,4.0,"The Burrard is a glorified motel with clever branding and a ""retro""-chic aesthetic.  

Location is great, aside from relentless traffic noise at night (and occasional blips from ambulance sirens from the hospital across the street)... without AC, it was necessary to keep windows open at all hours for ventilation.  Noise interfered with our sleep.

We had several problems with our room however:

1. Screen not mounted to window.
2. Bathroom sink drain stuck closed (lever to open it was broken)
3.  Shower water never got hot.
4. Furnace blowing hot air in the bathroom.
5. *** Furnace ""knob"" was broken in half... rusty, sharp, protruding metal... and not even functional, since the furnace cannot be controlled except by means of the central boiler in the basement.  So this flagrant tetanus biohazard was a useless vestige of an antique building...***

We brought our complaints to the front desk... and while the receptionist paid lip service to the need to remedy some of these wrongs (while others he justified), I nonetheless detected impatience and indifference... 

... until I displayed a photo of #5 on my phone (sharp rusty metal of broken furnace knob), which seemed to get his attention... perhaps less so because of the safety threat it posed and more so because I had procured visual evidence of an unflattering feature of the hotel.

To the Burrard's partial credit, 1 of these 5 problems was resolved during our stay (#2 = sink drain was opened and lever fixed).   The rest were outside of the maintenance person's direct control-- (#4 ambient furnace heat and #3 lukewarm shower being a product of a centralized temperature control... and we happened to arrive on the second sweltering day of mid-May, before the building had transitioned from cold to warm weather).

Upon our departure, the receptionist referenced #5 and said that it would be taken care of, thanking us for calling attention to it.  So at least there's the promise of appropriate maintenance (not that we'll be there to bear witness).  But still.  Should we have had to be the ones to point it out?  The knob literally serves no function, and the building has been renovated in the meantime.  An inexcusable oversight in my opinion.  And really grotesquely dangerous.  

Oh... and I am sure the manager of the Burrard will have some retort up her sleeve, calling attention to the ""positive"" attributes of this review while dismissing the negative (as I've noticed is a trend).  Honestly, that tactic is transparent and not at all endearing.  You'd do much better to own up to the hotel's flaws than brush them under the rug.",2014-05-17T08:11:01Z,119
141,The Burrard,4.0,"This place is great!  I can't think of what's not like about the place: the customer service, the amenities (woo, loaner bikes!), the location, the price, etc.  Everything is done exceptionally well.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, and if I were back in downtown Vancouver, I would absolutely stay here.",2015-05-14T03:30:23Z,119
142,The Burrard,4.0,"The worst hotel I've ever been to.

We had to find a hotel for the night, and this place was one of the few available.
 We came in, were the only ones in line and the guy at the front desk was free...We start checking in and he decides to take a call. 
Yes, he didn't put the person on hold, he was actually taking a call while we were still trying to check in.
We get to our room, the whole hotel reminded me of a swimming pool, but fair enough, I guess it's ""hipstery and cool"". Personally I didn't care for that vibe. It was pretty late so we head to bed almost straight away.
I think that at about midnight a truck comes in, right under our window, and there was so much noise. We call reception to complain, but ""there's nothing he can do about it."" Truck leaves at about 3 am, and we have about 4 hours of sleep since we have to go to work at 8 am.

In the morning we complain to the receptionist....and you've guessed it.  Nothing. Since they can't control the trucks they don't care of we can sleep or not. 

I would suggest to stay away from this hotel. There are enough places downtown.",2014-04-11T04:49:38Z,119
143,The Burrard,4.0,Cool hotel with VERY nice staff that are helpful to tourists in the area. Has a cool hangout area and a fun color scheme. Not a huge room but still plenty comfortable. You gotta try the coffee shop downstairs!,2022-08-09T05:08:08Z,119
144,The Burrard,4.0,"I booked this property because it looked fun and funky online. It definitely has those attributes but also really lacks in others. 

Positives:
Fun and funky touches throughout the spot 
Fireplace in the courtyard to enjoy 

Negatives:
In the room we had an extension cord/outlet poorly taped to the side of the desk for us to use. 
There are dings in most of the furniture and walls. Most hotels have several different types of pillows on the bed but they have only the overstuffed version which isn't comfortable. 
They don't allow debit cards (with Visa symbols through a major bank) to check-in. I understand it can take a little longer for debits to release the damage deposit, but isn't that on me to manage my bank account? 
Small bathroom with limited areas to put toiletries  


Overall the property is fine but I definitely expected more luxury funky than tacky funky for the price. Location is also a bit sketchy and didn't feel safe to walk around in.",2021-11-21T15:24:51Z,119
145,The Burrard,4.0,"The room was very clean and bright. I also appreciated the nespresso machine in the room, and free coffee. You could grab extra capsules in the lobby as well as bottled water as you needed it. There is an outdoor seating area around an electric fire, and palm trees behind it. It's lovely because it feels like a piece of paradise in the heart of the city. It is centrally located downtown, so you can walk to the beach, to main shopping streets, restaurants/cafes and the art museum. If you don't want to walk, you can use the hotel's free bikes or easily access public transportation. The staff were accommodating and helpful with getting new towels and supplies. Because covid measures are in place, you need to leave garbage/recycling outside of your door and request new towels, bedding, etc at the front desk. Everyone is wearing masks in shared spaces, and covid measures are followed appropriately.
The fire pit in the shared outside space could get a bit noisy at night when guests gathered around it, so it would be good if there were a cutoff time, when the fire is shut off. Also, some products in the bathroom, such as shampoo/conditioner/soap could be upgraded. Otherwise, this is a great place to stay in the city if you want a retro paradise feel that's close to everything.",2021-04-05T14:40:55Z,119
146,The Burrard,4.0,"I will start with the positives....

Pros: 
-Newly renovated, fresh, small boutiquey, cute hotel! 
-Cute sassy art 
-Comfortable bed and sheets
-They put candy on the pillow for you
-You can borrow a bike for no extra charge! So cool. 
-The hotel staff were all very friendly!
-It is connected to Elysian coffee, making it a convenient place to work (and use the hotel's free guest wifi) 
- AC unit in room 
-Good location for walking around downtown 
-They have ping pong and a fire pit
-They were nice to call me a taxi whenever I needed it (one sweet girl even ran outside to flag one for me when she couldn't get through on the phone)

Cons: 
-I noticed some oversights in the cleaning department (hair on my towels and in the shower)
-The pillows suck, I have such a crick in my neck from sleeping on them
- AC unit, yes they have one, but it is not central air so it doesn't just click on or off so all night I was fighting with being too cold or too hot in my room = poor sleep
-The courtyard feels like your are in an old apartment building, not a ton of hang out space if people have taken over the pit and ping pong table
-Let's just say that due to a homeless shelter nearby the people in this area could be a little sketch (I didn't go out at night by myself). During the day though, I felt perfectly safe. 
-Price...way over priced this time of year (Summer) for what you get.
-Shower- pressure in my room was just ok. 

Give it a go if you want to see for yourself.",2018-08-24T05:41:07Z,119
147,The Burrard,4.0,"After a two night stay at The Burrard, I can say that it's a great hotel for young folks (age or at heart) looking for a hip experience in the heart of the city. 

It's a refurbished motel with basic amenities, along with some essential upgrades like a very comfy bed and soft sheets. Dual soap/shampoo dispenser in the shower and some ok conditioner. It doesn't really matter since the Vancouver rain and wind will surely have its way with your 'do, no matter if you try or not to tame.

The location is perfect for waking around downtown. Street noise can be interesting at night. There was the occasional rant or loud vehicle, but as someone who used to live in a urban environment I find that strangely soothing. There's also a Burgoo and nice coffee shop next door so you've got good food and drink readily available.

Kudos for the gummy candy left on the bed. Can't resist a sweet treat.",2018-04-12T15:10:26Z,119
148,The Burrard,4.0,"Disappointing. I paid $400 for a ""queen plus"" room that appears to book for more than $500 on their direct booking site. The room is minuscule, but I could deal with that if the rest of the experience was worth the rate. The carpet from entrance to the other side of the room has large, long bubbles (see photo). I literally tripped over one on entering the room for the first time. Tiniest bathroom sink I've ever seen...where do you get this? So small that washing my face meant soaking the floor, my shoes, the entire area because there was no way to keep the water in the basin area. Soiled window curtain. Though it was cold and raining outside, the room was hot and stuffy. No place to ventilate the room except a window in the bathroom that cracks open. The AC is a stand alone unit that is incredibly loud. Scraped paint in doorways and cheaply made furniture. 

Blah. I booked because The Burrard holds a bit of hip cache and the rooms appeared from pictures to be crisp and comfortable. 

Two stars for pleasant front staff, location, water/coffee/tea. 

I would NOT recommend this place. Better to stay at the Howard Johnson or another chain nearby.",2019-06-06T17:12:06Z,119
149,The Burrard,4.0,"Cool retro-themed hotel at a good price! They have these free bikes that they let you rent for free, which is nice because you have to pay for parking everywhere in Vancouver. They also give you complementary gym membership to a nearby gym for the duration of your stay (since there's no on-site gym), and free water bottles in every room. Nespresso machine, pods, and a mini fridge also included in-room.

The hotel feels very cool and hip with the bright colors and awesome signs. The only thing is that the bathroom is pretty tiny, with a tiny sink and low water pressure in the shower. There's also no fan in the bathroom, only a window, which is not ideal for pooping during cold weather.

There's also a courtyard on the second floor (first floor is parking) with lots of trees and plants and benches and tables.

The location is pretty close to a lot of restaurants and shops, but we didn't want to walk because it was freezing when we came.

All in all, I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Vancouver!",2016-01-05T21:25:20Z,119
150,The Burrard,4.0,"We selected the Burrard in downtown Vancouver because of the reasonable price. What we found was a great little no-frills hotel, friendly employees, nice amenities, and a comfortable place to spend the night. When you walk in, the ""old-school"" chic lobby is welcoming and the check in process simple and easy. We visited the adjoining coffee shop for a little caffeine to get the day restarted after our long flight from Florida. After dropping our luggage in our room, we explored the nice atrium area with a fire pit, clean fresh lounging seating areas, beautiful flowers, shrubs and trees, and a ping pong table. Definitely a nice little oasis in the middle of the hotel to socialize. The only drawback was the socializing guests were right outside our window so it took away from the peace and quiet we were ready for in our room later in the evening. If we were not so tired, we would have enjoyed the setting more ourselves. 

We checked out the free bikes and helmets from the hotel, got some maps and suggestions from the hotel employees and biked off to Stanley Park. After a long ride, we asked for additional suggestions for dinner and again the next day to get other tourist information and transportation arrangements. The front desk staff could not have been more helpful. Overall The Burrard was a really great place to stay and we would highly recommend staying here and look forward to another visit here again ourselves in the future.",2018-06-25T11:10:54Z,119
151,The Burrard,4.0,"James, the nice guy at the front desk greeted us as we arrived at 1:30 AM. He offered us water, candy package and a warm hello after a very long flight and an efficient, but time consuming de board and customs check in. 

The hotel is a charming updated 1950's motel, with doors to each room secured by a wonderful center courtyard entry. 

At night the fire table and seating area outside on second floor provides a wonderful gathering place with a ping pong table. 

The room was well accommodated, extremely clean and meticulous in design and style. Great nespresso style coffee pods and nice shower system. Amazingly quiet in room 322. And the bed, heavenly. Two pillows to choose from, appears that a few are extra thick. Shower well supplied and room is so clean and linens, cotton. Overall, lovely start to our stay in Vancouver, BC. We will return! Mahalo!",2019-03-07T06:50:00Z,119
152,The Burrard,4.0,"Five of us shared one room. There were two full beds plus one cot. It was still pretty roomy even with the cot in the middle on the room. The staff was excellent. They gave us extra towels (bath, hand, & face). We didn't ask for maid service during our stay, but when we needed toilet paper, it came within 5 minutes. One of the staff members (Maria) even said hi to us when we ran into her on the street. 

This place offers free bike rentals, but unfortunately we didn't get to take advance of this. The bikes we saw were cute though! It had a wooden crate attached to the rear to carry your belongings. One thing that could be better is the lighting in the room. It was hard for us to get ready when it was dimly lit. 

The extra cot is $30/day
The self parking is $28/day",2015-07-19T04:26:35Z,119
153,The Burrard,4.0,"Melrose Place-esque

I had reservations to stay here when they first opened, but a missing cat and broken leg thwarted my plans. 

Enter the summer of 2016; we were making our way up north for our friends 50th wedding anniversary, and decided to prolong our holiday by a few days and head up a little further north to Vancouver. 
I've always had a crush on this town and wish I lived a little closer.

Due to some unexpected circumstances, we had to leave our friends party earlier then planned and arrived in the city VERY early. 

Entering the lobby, the decor and fun artwork made me smile.
The young lady working front desk was very friendly and let us check in early.  (Thank You!)

We had reserved a larger room but they didn't have one available. They gave us free parking and a slight discount in return. 

The court yard was well planned out. I loved the landscaping, and colorful yet functional furniture.

The room was a little tight but was cute enough and met our needs.

The roll away a/c unit was much appreciated. 

The bathroom was spotless, but tiny. One of the shelves above the toilet was angled downwards a little and made me rethink putting anything onto it.

The water pressure wasn't strong but they had plenty of hot water.
 
The most important thing, the bed, was heavenly! 
We slept very well. Being on a top floor helped and is always appreciated.

The location can't be beat, as it was walking distance to almost everything on our agenda.
The convent parking in the lot below was a plus. 

We also enjoyed the coffee shop that adjoined the hotel.

I loved our stay!  I can't think of staying anywhere else. Give me charm over cooperate any day.",2016-07-20T03:45:35Z,119

156,The Burrard,4.0,"I really liked this place! Mostly my friend & I picked it for our trip because the price is very reasonable for the area and it's centrally located. However, I was pleasantly surprised! The rooms are pretty nice - do note that if you're looking for a generic Holiday Inn style hotel, this is not the place for you - very eclectic but clean and comfortable. I was worried from pictures that it was motel-like in that your room door was open to the outside, but actually there's just a beautiful courtyard in the middle of the rooms. So, your room door does open onto that, but not to the actual outside. 

They also have free bike rentals, which we didn't end up using but wish we had! Such a nice perk. I'd recommend staying here for sure!",2016-06-28T16:28:17Z,119
157,The Burrard,4.0,"I'm perpetually searching (even when I don't need to ;D) for boutique hotels with helpful conveniences/practicality w/o a boutique price. The Burrard delivered: welcoming receptionist + overall atmosphere / proximity to notable food and sights / cozy, well-designed room.

The Burrard is walkable to the ferry stop that'll take you to Granville, or near Robson where we walked to for a post-flight meal @Shizen-Ya.

The hip rooms face an inner courtyard playing the occasional Smiths song. Toiletries are in squeeze bottles that were a bit hard to use, but that's quite a minor complaint. We appreciated the cheeky signs directing our towel usage. Heater is in the bathroom, so it was colder elsewhere. Also dug the little bag of free gummies on our bed, enjoying them while appreciating the humor of Canadian tv commercials.

We didn't even pay 90+ through Hotel Tonight, which only encourages us to return.",2017-11-05T10:30:02Z,119

159,The Burrard,4.0,The rooms are adequate. There is nothing wrong with them. However for the price I was expecting more. Basically a glorified motor inn. For what you pay it is just not worth it. Also the tightest parking spots I have ever parked in. Just over priced.,2021-09-06T13:35:47Z,119
160,The Burrard,4.0,"Let me start with the fact that I really liked this hotel. The decor is thoughtfully put together AND the signage is clever. This is huge. I want hotels with character and personality, which this one definitely has. They clearly hired or have some great designers/writers.

The only reason this is not a 5 star is because the hot water broke at night, and my husband had to take a cold shower to try to wash off face paint from the Women's World Cup. We called down to inform them. They were very apologetic and tried to get it fixed quickly; however, I feel they could have gone that extra step to comp a night of our parking when we checked out the next day. I hate the customers that complain in order to get free stuff, so I operate on the hope that (if the business has fantastic service) they will go the extra distance without prompting. 

Regardless, I would still return to The Burrard because a 4 out of 5 is still a great hotel with good service.",2015-06-25T21:04:16Z,119
161,The Burrard,4.0,Small but AMAZING service. They let us check in at 11 instead of 4 and there is complementary bike rentals and also our room came with complementary wster bottles in the fridge that is free.

162,The Burrard,4.0,"For those who want a taste of Europe, here's a place in Vancouver to consider. The rooms are well-designed with lighting in the right places with bedside options for ambient and reading lights. The furniture is rather Spartan, and comfortable. As Nespresso users, we enjoyed the machine in the room and the refrigerator for our own snacks on our three-day stay. It's in easy walking distance of downtown and local grocery and wine stores. The small bathroom is still easy to move around and is well laid out. The indoor protected parking is a plus and while it was too cold to use it, the attractive sitting area on the second floor would be a great place to settle into on a late spring through early fall evening. As a couple, we stayed in both the Queen and Queen+ rooms - same price for both. The size of the former is 200 square feet and the latter is 237. The smaller room faced the indoor treed courtyard while the larger was had a large window on the exterior wall. This is important because the building is across from a hospital, so there were frequent ambulance sirens, although not enough to bother us. The marginally extra space was worth it.  Plus, pleasant and helpful front desk staff.",2021-04-03T15:45:28Z,119
163,The Burrard,4.0,"Cutest, most affordable hotel in Vancity.

My boyfriend and I recently popped over for a one night trip to eat and drink our way through Vancouver. Living just 2 hours south, it's easy to come for a quick trip and see what we can in spurts. So on this trip we booked a room at the Burrard and absolutely loved it. Wanting to be close to Granville Island, this hotel is walking distance to both the CBD and Granville. We got lots of exercise and the little sanctuary that was our room was in the heart of a lot of other activities in Yaletown. 

Don't get me wrong, this isn't a fancy place to stay, but that's what we loved about it. Simple, cute and clean, the room was small and just what we needed for a place to crash. Parking was below the hotel in a secure garage, there were free bikes to borrow to ride around the city on, and the style and decor here is unforgettable. Sort of like a time warp to the 1960's, you're transported to a colorful, clean Jetson's style hotel. On the main level there's a little restaurant called Betty's and even a 7-11 if you need to stock up on food or other supplies 24/7. I'll definitely stay here again!",2013-07-04T18:37:44Z,119

First time in town, and the Burrard put us in a great location for a great price with easy access to Davie and Stanley Park. It's nothing super fancy, but has just the right small touches to make the experience feel special: free candy on check-in, an in room expresso machine and tea kettle, and a chromecast on the TV. The courtyard between the rooms is also cute; it's decorated and has a gas fireplace. 

The only real negative was parking, which was a bit tight to navigate and has a very steep incline that scraped the bottom of our car. If we had been coming and going more, that might have been more of a bother. However, parking was cheap for the day and the staff was wonderful to allow us to keep our car there a bit after check-out in order to do some final exploring of the area. 

We will definitely be returning! :)",2020-01-08T14:43:21Z,119
165,The Burrard,4.0,"Affordable, sure, but I wouldn't call The Burrard ""cheap"".  Firstly, when I was in Vancouver, the rate was well over $150 a night.  Secondly, the amenities are far better than what you world expect from a ""cheap"" hotel.  At check in, you give them your credit card so they can take a deposit for incidentals, but soon after they tell you about how you get free wifi, free bottled water, free phone calls, etc, and are left wondering what incidentals could there be?

The Burrard has the appearance of a hotel that was recently purchased and has been remodeled and upgraded.  Outside of the lack of AC, I have no complaints about the place.

A $30 cabride from the airport, The Burrard is centrally located, downtown.  Only a block away from the West End, there's certainly plenty of nightlife.  A five minute walk south takes you to Robson, with all of it's fine dining, high end shopping, the mall, etc.

167,The Burrard,4.0,"I came for our Neurology conference, all the big hotels were rented out, and I was looking for a more local, boutique hotel.   The Burrard was perfect: just a short walk to the conference center, and walking distance to nearly everything that would attract a short term visitor.  The style was cheeky retro-chic with clever deviant photography and postcards in the room.  Not opulent in terms of the overall design but very functional and just right for the price.  There wasn't very good central air but they had a small fan that cooled things mostly down, although when entering the room after a long warm walk home it felt very stuffy, and I couldn't open the windows.  The central area is nicely gardened and open to the elements.   The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I took advantage of the free bikes to ride around the entire north part including Stanley Park, it was great!   Close to the Davies street nightlife.   Recommended!",2016-04-30T22:16:34Z,119
168,The Burrard,4.0,"Neat hotel, great location, and very reasonable price.

The Burrard is an old interior-courtyard-style motel renovated in a sort of neo-60s Palm Beach style and combined with gracious service and modern amenities to create a boutique hotel with oodles of personality.  Just check out the photos which will show you more about this unique property than I could ever describe.

Our limited interactions with the staff were pleasant and helpful.  The building is within short to medium walking distance of everything that you would want to see or do in downtown Vancouver.  The rooms are generally petty small, but well appointed.  Besides, the hotel is just so neat that it's a treat to stay here.

Here are some details that stood out:

+  Two free bottled waters
+  Wall-mounted flat screen TV
+  mini fridge
+  free wi-fi

-  No cups
-  Tiny sink
-  No exhaust fan in bathroom, leading to constantly damp room

Another thing that I noticed is that all the decor in the room is black, white, or metallic, except for the (mostly hidden) bed frame and the bedside table, which are dark brown wood.  It doesn't match, almost jarringly so.

But quibbles aside, this was a fun and satisfactory hotel stay that was curiously cheap given the combination of factors.",2012-07-08T20:29:32Z,119
169,The Burrard,4.0,"We were headed to Vancouver for the weekend and wanted a budget-friendly hotel in the downtown/touristy area that was close enough to fun stuff to be walkable. A friend recommended the Burrard, and it was perfect for our needs!

If you're familiar with the Jupiter Hotel in Portland, it's very similar in look and feel (though the Burrard has nicer furnishings and bigger rooms). Basically, it's a retro-midcentury-Jetsons style with a winking sense of humor, charming enough to get you to overlook its minor shortcomings.

From the street, you only see the lobby entrance. The parking garage is accessed through the lobby and the rooms start on the second floor, with doors facing onto an inner courtyard with planters and outdoor seating. We were in room 206, on the side that faces the street, meaning we were directly opposite the emergency entrance of the hospital across the street. These are the bigger rooms, but the trade-off is that ambulances are blaring RIGHT outside your window a handful of times per night. Obviously, they don't mention that on the hotel website. If you're willing to have a smaller room in exchange for less street noise, ask for a room on the other side. However, besides the ambulances, we didn't hear any noise coming through our walls from other rooms, and only minimal noise from guests walking past -- the advantage of being in a corner room. 

Mostly, the room was fine. Our bed was comfortable enough and they provided plenty of pillows. The one flimsy throw blanket wasn't much help and was more there for looks. The novelty furniture looks cool but isn't very comfortable (molded plastic chairs, clear lucite side table). Toiletries are provided, sort of, in the form of squeeze bottles of shampoo, hand soap, and lotion -- travel-size bottles are available by request at the front desk. The towels were on the scratchy side, but thick and absorbent, and were replaced daily. Our room safe broke  and we had to call the front desk for assistance, but they sent someone quickly to unlock it.

Actually, the biggest problem with the room was the light. The windows have short inner curtains and blackout liners, but the liner is a couple of inches shorter than the window, so you get a bright line of light right at eye level when you're in bed. The heater in our room was in the bathroom, but the window in there had no curtain, and thanks to the angle of the mirrored closet door, leaving the bathroom door open = sunlight bouncing off the mirror into the room. So you have to choose between a colder, darker room or a warmer, brighter one. If you're an early riser or don't mind sunny rooms, this might not be an issue for you. 

Parking was $28/day with in/out privileges, which is pretty typical for Vancouver. The parking garage is VERY tight and spaces are difficult to get in and out of, even when the garage isn't very full. The underground level seems to be a bit easier to negotiate. 

As others mentioned, there are free loaner bikes in the garage, free wifi, complimentary admission to a nearby gym, free water bottles and Nespresso pod coffee machines in your room. Having a small fridge was great for chilling beverages, and there are several wine shops and liquor stores within a few blocks. The Burrard is very close to Robson, Davie, Granville, and the ferry stop that will take you to Granville Island and other destinations if you don't have a car. The staff were all friendly and very helpful whenever we had questions and greeted us whenever we walked through the lobby. 

Overall, you can't beat this place for the price. A fun place to stay with a good location if you want to explore downtown Vancouver and ditch the car.",2016-01-19T20:16:58Z,119
170,The Burrard,4.0,"I don't like giving 5 stars but I really can't think of a reason not to. This place was amazing. I'm from Long Beach, CA (Los Angeles) and my boyfriend and I traveled up here for a quick vacation. We wish we had an extra day to just lay around the hotel room and watch TV. 

Location: perfect, it was walking distance to everything downtown. There is a coffee shop located right next door.

Green: The advertise a lot to save water and not wash the sheets if not necessary. Which is awesome. They also GIVE you for FREE 2 water bottles in the room and you can refill them in the lobby anytime. 

Amenities: They allow you to use they're Mac computer in the lobby and can print anything as well. (which came in handy when I forgot to book and print our train tickets). We went during Jan so it was a little cold, but we want to go back when it warms up and use their free bikes! 

Cleanliness: The place is very clean. I am a freak and typically show with sandals in hotel showers because the floor grosses me out. I did not have to use flip flops this time! Very very clean. 

Parking: They have an inclosed parking structure for $25 for a night and since you're downtown its pretty reasonable. 

We are trying to figure in another trip to VAN this year and will definitely stay here again.",2014-01-31T21:36:16Z,119
171,The Burrard,4.0,"Okay, so I won't lie. I had booked another, much fancier hotel prior to booking the Burrard. Then, last minute I decided there was no point in spending an arm and a leg, plus I found a great deal on Booking.com and it came highly recommended by a coworker. 

When I arrived, the front desk staff was friendly and helped to check me in, then directed me on how to get into the secured parking garage. When I got to my room I was originally a bit let down but it soon grew on me. It had a super cute and contemporary style and the bed was really comfortable. 

Being from California, this property felt like I was in Palm Springs - which was refreshing and made me feel like I was at home. The rooms were equipped with coffee makers and with a telephone that had free long distance calling in North America - YES! This was a great added bonus!

On top of clean rooms and great service this hotel had a PRIME location. I went everywhere. And I did it all on the bikes the hotel has that you can rent. It was the dead of winter when I went so all of the bikes were available, but I hear when the sun is out they are harder to come by. 

I rode the bike to Granville Island, to Stanley park, to Robson Shopping, to the Gastown, I rode it everywhere and it was the BEST feature of the hotel. Armed with maps and recommendations from the front desk, each day I attacked Vancouver and saw a bunch! Great property!",2013-12-31T06:00:31Z,119
172,The Burrard,4.0,"How did I ever forget to review this blast from the past boutique hotel. If the Burrard were to be Too Hip To be Square...well then it would be the furthest thing from square i wager! What a hip spot!

This far out, recently reno'd motel, teal coloured, faux-grass carpet in the hall and rainforest smack dab in the middle is the perfect mix of hip, comfort, cool, vintage, and a pinch of awesome!!

The rooms are a good size for travel, clean, and cozy. Equipped with flat screens, a huge comfortable bed, and a cornucopia of freebies such as: bottled water, wifi, long distance and not a standard in room coffee maker BUT an in-room Nespresso Espresso machine God bless this spot they know the exact way to my heart! There's a desk for working and a small area for relaxing. Each room has an safe and mini-fridge as well. Standard fare for hotel accommodations in my books, but exceeds a standard motel expectation!

I did find the bathroom to be a touch on the small side. OK in size for 1 person but don't even try to squish 2 in there - god forbid your night goes really well and you try for a 3. No luck chuck.. that's what the killer king size bed is for slugger :)

However, I digress. This review was a long time coming and I I must say that this spot adheres to the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle and does it well on on fronts. Staff is friendly, warm and helpful. Accommodations are simple, comfortable and perfect for what you need while on short term business. Bottom line this is where I'll be staying the next time I'm in Vancouver!",2012-11-17T23:19:52Z,119
173,The Burrard,4.0,Super cute boutique hotel in downtown Vancouver!  It's like a little piece of South Miami Beach in Canada.  The decor is really nice with friendly staff.  Rooms are clean and I really love the touches of pop art throughout the lobby and rooms.  The courtyard is adorable with palm trees and a deco style lounge area.  The lobby is also well decorated and is the type of lobby that you just want to sit and hang out in.  A fun stay and I definitely recommend it!,2017-03-01T05:06:13Z,119
174,The Burrard,4.0,I totally loved this place. The service here is top-notch. The rooms are really clean and the mini-sink was adorable. The location is fairly central. The bikes they lend out are pretty awesome - we used them to bike all the way to and through Stanley Park. I would highly recommend this place!,2015-09-22T00:41:57Z,119
175,The Burrard,4.0,"3.5 stars (rounded-up) for this quaint, hip, and affordable hotel right-smack in the middle of downtown Vancouver.  

PROS:
- Price: Consistently one of the best bangs for your buck as far as hotels in Vancouver.  Several freebies, including wifi, Nespresso machine and pods (decaf and Arpeggio), water bottles, bikes, courtesy umbrellas, and access to nearby gym, sweeten the deal.
- Service: What a friendly bunch of folks - from the front desk crew to housekeeping.
- Location: You are walking distance from Yaletown, Robson Street, Davie Street, Granville Street shopping and nightlife, the Burrard Bridge (great views), the Public Library, English Bay, and a bit longer but still manageable walk to Stanley Park, Kits, and a whole bunch of other attractions.  

CONS:
- Comfort: I have stayed here several times and have had a different in-room experience each time.  Some of the rooms have hard-as-rock beds, while others are perfect.  Some of the bathrooms have no tubs, while others do. Shower pressure may vary from room to room. Personally, I prefer the higher-numbered rooms (facing Helmcken), but make sure you state your preference if you have one at the time of reservation.
- Thin Walls: You can hear everything your neighbors are doing.  Seriously, everything.  

Misc. Notes: portable heater/air conditioner in every room now; on-site parking is available for an additional fee.",2015-10-13T20:26:58Z,119
176,The Burrard,4.0,"The Burrard is a totally hip, totally affordable option when looking for a hotel in Vancouver. It kind of looks like it used to be an old hotel (motel, Holiday Inn, say what?!) that they put some real love into with an upgrade. 

All the rooms have exterior doors that are in an inner square surrounding a parking area that has the loveliest of green spaces on it's roof. The rooms are kind of small (mine had a full sized bed), but nothing like the tiny spaces I often stay in when choosing boutique hotels in bigger cities.

The hip factor extends from everything like the fact that you can borrow bicycles from the front desk to get around town to their ""information"" book, which is actually a series of postcards that feature facts about the hotel (where to get ice, how to make calls, etc.) as well as pictures of painfully cool people and scenes.

The location is top dollar. It's quite walkable to many shops, restaurants, and bars. Plus they have the aforementioned bikes if you want to go a bit further. 

The folks that I interacted with were super friendly and the price was on point. I'd definitely stay here again!",2015-07-17T17:28:39Z,119
177,The Burrard,4.0,"The Burrard is a cute midcentury oasis in downtown in a great location near restaurants, shops, and the ferry to Granville Island. We stayed in a double room, and it was more spacious than I imagined it would be. Bathroom was small, which is to be expected for a former motel, but clean. I requested a room in the back of the hotel, and it was pretty quiet, but it is in the middle of the city, so hearing some city noise is inevitable. Every weekday morning around 7, there were dumpster & construction sounds, but it's a good wake up call to get out and explore! I was impressed at how much sound the windows block out, and I liked that you could open them for fresh air. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The bikes are a nice amenity, and there are bike lanes separated from car lanes by a concrete barrier on the streets by the hotel, so if you're squeamish about biking in traffic, you don't have anything to worry about! I really enjoyed the Nespresso, free bottled water, and wifi. The only issue we had was the bathtub getting clogged, but the housekeeper was so sweet about it, even leaving an apologetic note. I would definitely stay here again!",2018-06-17T04:03:00Z,119

179,The Burrard,4.0,"Loved this cute little hotel! Was lucky enough to stumble upon it on Instagram and stayed here a few weeks ago when I was visiting Van.  Super cute renovated hotel, right in the middle of where you need to be, they have cute little cruiser bikes you can rent and cruise all over the city (so you don't need a car).... Michael at the front desk was amazing. And super helpful and Darren the hotel manager was also great.  It's also connected to a great little coffee shop next door.  Also love this place at night for hanging out, the courtyard where they have a fire pit.  Rooms are minimal but modern.  Great value and great place to stay on your next stay!  Definitely a thumbs up!",2017-11-16T19:33:27Z,119
180,The Burrard,4.0,"I stayed at The Burrard 3/09-3/10 in Room 221.

The hotel was easy to find and just a couple blocks down from the main shopping corridor. I checked in after 8 pm and was promptly greeted. I reserved/paid with a credit card and was surprised that the hotel places a hold of $100 CAD onto your credit card for incidentals. Not really an issue, but would have been nice to have read about it on their website. I was given directions to my room, and after a long night of driving I couldn't remember much more. The parking garage is under the hotel and visible from the walkway to your room (a plus for me so I could see the car) if you have a large car, like a tahoe or expedition- you may want to leave it at home. Its a small parking garage with small spaces and my VW Routan Mini Van fit with some wiggle room, not a lot but enough. The room is nicely done. The postcards on the bed have all the information you need, from making calls ect. (bonus is the free calling to the US) there is free wifi, and the bed was conformable. They don't offer small bottles of hotel body wash (which I usually use for bubble baths) and didn't realize until it was too late as I didn't get to enjoy the bath tub. Overall, the beds are comfortable, more than enough room to move around and its a central location.
The parking garage keypad is on the right side so when you are on Burrard and turn right on Helmcken St to get to the alley where the garage is located - unless you have a passenger you'll have to get out of your car to put your roomcard against the key pad to open- so at night it isn't something I wanted to do. The only way to avoid this would be to go down Helmcken, turn right on Howe, right again on Davie St and then a right down the alley way before Burrard. It would have been nice for the gentlemen at the front desk to explain that to me.  They do offer free bikes but it was raining and I just walked to where I need to go. Parking currently is $28 CAD for the day- and they did allow me to keep my car there after I checked out.",2016-03-17T02:18:19Z,119
181,The Burrard,4.0,"I booked this on the basis of their web info and a few reviews and I'm so glad I did!  The day front desk staff were incredibly helpful and friendly - a particular thanks to Maria for suggestions for family outings.  

I was a bit nervous about the size of the rooms, not knowing what to expect of 50s era hotel design, but no worries there.  The double room was just the right size for our family of 4 and very clean and quiet.  The beds were comfy, but the the the bathroom sink was a bit small for hubby to shave and the light above the mirror a bit dim for makeup application!  The free water is great - just refill your bottle at the cooler in the lobby.

The location is near Davie St (3 min walk) which offers an amazing array of food options and within walking distance of Stanley Park and the port (if you brought good walking shoes!).  The bikes looked awesome, but unfortunately our youngest isn't up to city biking yet.

All in all, a terrific value.   We'll be back if we're ever in Vancouver!",2015-08-10T17:47:22Z,119
182,The Burrard,4.0,"Overpriced! 
$150 a night, small rooms, $20 a night for parking, and then they try to charge you when their loaner bicycle peddles break. (I almost crashed when the damn pedal came of while ridding) 

(free wifi)",2012-05-30T19:51:27Z,119
183,The Burrard,4.0,"This hotel was not worth it. The room we got was very very tiny, the fan in the bathroom didn't turn on (when you're spending time with a significant other in a tiny room, a fan is very important), the pictures of the court yard are misleading (the court yard is also very tiny), and it's way to expensive for what you get. 

We got our bill and we where shocked, 498 CAD for three nights, our groupon deal made it seem like it would be a lot less. They charged over 80$ in taxes, they charged 28$ a night for parking and an additional 22.72 in parking tax. I'm not necessarily complaining about the taxes them selves seeing as they may be mandatory, I'm more so upset by the lack of transparency there was about the taxes and the final cost of the hotel stay.

I am giving this hotel two stars because the staff was very nice to us but the hotel did not deliver on transparency of cost, the overall size and lack of value of the room we where getting. Not worth the cost.",2016-02-24T07:56:46Z,119
184,The Burrard,4.0,Everything about this Hotel was great. Rooms were clean and adorable. Espresso machine in room. Yay! Beautiful and clean courtyard. Staff was so friendly and kind!! Very helpful.

185,The Burrard,4.0,"The Burrard is a little hidden gem in the middle of Vancouver that is designed for those folks who are confident in who they are...and those who are not pretentious but would rather stay in the perfect place to enjoy this amazing city. I can't think of a single criticism for this hotel which
met our every need. The service is wonderful and the rooms were very clean and comfortable.  Well done!",2016-07-17T04:00:33Z,119

The rooms are on the small side, and have windows to open for fresh air, and a dyson fan which was nice and fairly quiet. 
The location was perfect for walking to see many Vancouver sights. And they have bikes available too! 
The coffee shop downstairs compliments the hotel nicely and makes a great cup of coffee.

189,The Burrard,4.0,"This boutique mid-century inspired spot is the perfect location for Vancouver exploration. The rooms are perfectly sized and comfortable and courtyard is a jungle oasis. 

The staff were all super friendly and provided so many helpful hints. 

They have 12 bikes on hand for guest to check out and explore the city. However, get down to the bike rack early because the bikes go quickly.",2014-09-10T19:17:08Z,119
190,The Burrard,4.0,"The Burrrard is too cool for school. It's a nifty renovated motel that has a great branding team, some solid design aspects, friendly staff, a pretty decent location, value-driven rates, comfortable accommodations and nice extras. Yeah, that was a run-on sentence. So sue me. 

This hotel is like a cross between two of my more-loved properties in Portland - The Jupiter Hotel and The Ace Hotel. The plan itself unfolds as it often does with the Jupiter - a classic boxy motel that's been hipped up with stylish, clever branding and clean design. It takes a turn along the Ace's path with some of the more urban/design-forward features like unique tiling in the bathrooms, hip fixtures and the like. Overall it has much more the feel of the Jupiter, which in the end is young, fresh and hip. 

The rooms are on the small-ish side, clean, and cozy. They feature flat screens, comfy beds, free bottled water, free wifi, free long distance anywhere on the continent and a nice in-room espresso machine. There's a desk for working and a small area for relaxing. Each room has an in-room safe and mini-fridge as well, which are nice touches. There is no pool onsite nor a workout facility, but you can get a free pass to the Steve Nash Fitness World down the street (no pool, but decent workout facilities). 

It's super refreshing to stay in a hotel that doesn't try to nickel-and-dime its guests for stuff like wifi and various other sundries. While it's not your usual luxury/boutique style hotel, The Burrard is almost as comfortable as one.Based on the demographic they're obviously chasing with the branding (young, hip, party-ready) I could imagine that things could get raucous here on packed nights, but I didn't experience any of that myself. 

I will totally stay here on return visits. Especially if I get a less-than-$100/night rate like I did this go round. That's totally worth it!",2012-01-23T03:18:56Z,119
191,The Burrard,4.0,"Hip and cool factor are high, high, high. Everything is clean, clean, clean. (Except for that small pile of vomit that greeted me at the top of the stairs in the middle of the night, but hey, it was 1am!)

The design here is smart, and I dig what they've done with this little reformed, remodeled motel. There is espresso in the rooms! There is free water in the rooms! They have all of your needed extras and they're nice (soap, lotion, shampoo, conditioner) There is free wifi! And, it is cheap!

The few cons that made this border on a 3-star experience: 1. Outside entry rooms. 2. No countertop space. (a lady needs a place to arrange her sundries!) 3. My sink wasn't working properly, but I am sure they will get that fixed up. 

But, for a cheap, hip option, they go above and beyond, so 4-stars it is!",2012-02-23T15:22:22Z,119
192,The Burrard,4.0,"My new bride and I came to Canada from San Francisco on our honeymoon. We planned to stay 3 days in this ""funky"" hotel but we had to leave after finding problems with our stay.

Our room was unbearably hot and humid. Outside it was 72 degrees, 90% humidity outside on July 7th, our room was 80 degrees+ according to the thermostat on the provided swamp cooler. Our queen room was claustrophobicly  small and it had only 1 window that would open, and that only a crack. The room (#317) had no other ventilation. Using the swamp cooler didn't help due to the humidity and the fact that it was loud as a rocket engine.  [update: I should note that Vancouver was having a bit of a heat wave when we stayed there]

Did I mention the claustrophobicly small room? The dim daylight-colored (blueish) compact fluorescent lights in the room were unflattering. The bathroom sink was child-sized and difficult to keep water in when washing hands and such. Water flow in the shower was anemic. But the part about being steamed alive in a tiny box was what made us leave.

It looks like a cool hotel but it's just a bunch of tiny rooms with some pretty signs. I wanted to believe the hype about the place, I did. Sorry. :-(

Thankfully, they let us check out a day early with no problem.",2014-07-13T05:51:02Z,119

Love my coffee in the morning also it's nice to have a fridge in the room and they would stock bottle water. I also enjoyed the complimentary bikes they were really cute and they were great to ride around Stanley park. They also provided umbrellas  if you needed them. This will be a hotel I shall revisit when I return to Vancouver!,2016-11-28T00:57:57Z,119
194,The Burrard,4.0,"Just stayed here for 4 days. 

After booking the Hotel online i ve received an email from the staff. asking if there is an help needed. That was already a great start. i replied by asking for directions from the airport.

In an immediate reply they answered with all possibilities in all details. Fantastic! Finally I followed their recommendations and took the Skytrain. 

After arrival I thought,  hmm, what is "" boutique"" in this Hotel? Rooms are small, you can look from the outside straight into the bed and the sink in the bathroom is one of the smallest I ve ever seen. My room did  include a small aircon machine, which does not seem to work properly. At least it was extremely noisy, so I switched it off. Left windows open instead.
The next day I took breakfast but was told, it is not included in the room rate. 
Actually, it was, according to my booking. So they corrected accordingly .

Here are the pros:

+ location: More downtown is not possible a least at this price point!
   from here you can explore Vancouver just by walking. So I did, including Stanley park, China town, Sience world, Granville Island etc.
+ free cruse bike rental: be quick, after 6:30 am they might be all gone
   Ok, they are just cruise bikes, I went uphill to Grouse Mnt, that was a 
challenge  with that bike. 
+ free perfect working wifi
+ iMac in the Lobby with connected printer, for free printing
+ friendly stuff at the reception, i.e. the nice guy from New Delhi, but also the others
+ breakfast in the ""Container"" from 6 am. Fanastic italian sandwiches.

All in all a very nice stay with some minor hick-ups.",2014-08-07T17:22:11Z,119

196,The Burrard,4.0,"All aboard the Delorean--step into this time capsule of a hotel! Very clean, hipster friendly hotel with a nice spin on all things pre-millennial that millennials now love. Get ready to be enlightened every time you hop on the elevator!(I'll let you stop in to figure that one out) anyways, truly a great place to stay as we ventured through Vancouver, Squamish, Whistler and surrounding areas!",2017-06-08T04:41:16Z,119
197,The Burrard,4.0,"This is going to be a long review, so I'm going to summarize the highlights in case you don't get through all of it:

THERE IS NO HEAT.  THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE.  DON'T LET THE PICTURES FOOL YOU - SUPER CHEAP ""UPGRADES""

And now for the detail:

I stayed here for one night, mainly drawn by the relatively affordable price point, convenient location and how it looked quite modern and hip. A long time loyal fan of the Ace hotel chains, I expected something similar. The motor inn has been updated and remodeled with quirky little signs and funky posters - but beyond that, there wasn't much to offer.  It was just a souped up Motel 6.  What looked like really nice walnut furniture was nothing more than cheap veneer where most of it was pulled back and exposed the cheap particle board underneath.  Our room was on the second floor and the sound of ambulances from the hospital across the street and the bustling traffic will lull you right to sleep.  

We checked in on May 29th. For anyone from out of town and not familiar with the PNW region, the weather is still fairly unpredictable during this time of the year. On the evening we checked in, it was just barely 55 degrees Fahrenheit (13 degrees Celsius) outside. The windows had been left open in the room so it was colder inside than outside. We tried to adjust the thermostat to crank up the heat to warm up, but it didn't seem to be working. So we went downstairs to ask if maybe we were doing it wrong, or if the heat in the room wasn't working. 

""We've turned off the heat for the season.""

We were stunned. Actually, we thought the front desk clerk was joking with us and laughed. He continued to look back at us with a straight face and then offered:

""I can give you an extra blanket if you'd like.""

Summer has barely started.  It's still cold enough that we were both bundled up in leather jackets - and there is NO HEAT.  

We understand that the front desk clerk couldn't do anything more. He wasn't a manager and couldn't authorize any sort of refund of any sort. He told us to go out and get dinner and that he was going to be on the phone with a manager and would have a response for us when we got back. We came back a few hours later to a different front desk clerk. He told us that the manager had authorized a 10% discount. At this point, it was just patronizing. This second front desk agent was very friendly and understanding and told us that the manager would be in at 9 in the morning and that we could speak with them in person.

We originally wanted to check out early because we were trying to catch an early ferry, but we were so frustrated with the heating situation and all we decided to check out at 9 so that we could speak with them and just catch a later ferry. at 9:15 am, we go downstairs to the front desk. 

""Hi, we'd like to speak with the manager""
""They're not here right now""
""When will they be here?""
""They're in a meeting and won't be in until the afternoon""

We couldn't waste any more of the day and just decided to check out. As the bill comes, there is no 10% discount. When we brought it up, the front desk clerk tells us that he has no idea what we're talking about. He says that every conversation we had with the prior two clerks had been documented but there was no mention of a discount. I could care less about saving $16 but it's how we were handed over from agent to agent and being told different things that was the most frustrating.  And for the third agent to think I am trying to talk my way into getting a whopping $16 back - it was beyond patronizing.  

It's an old building, I get it. The front desk clerks don't have managerial authority, I get it. But I have never been treated like this by any service industry before. I will never go back to this hotel and I will never recommend this to anyone. This might be a souped up version of Motel 6, but at least Motel 6 has heat.",2014-06-03T01:42:50Z,119
198,The Burrard,4.0,"I enjoyed my stay at the bumpers inn! They had plenty of perks- great location downtown, aesthetically pleasing, ping pong table, a coffee shop attached and if you don't like the coffee shop downstairs, there's a Nespresso machine in your room. The staff was kind and attentive. The parking is a bit expensive at $28.",2019-08-04T02:50:08Z,119
199,The Burrard,4.0,Fun little hotel in the middle of downtown Vancouver. Rooms are clean and remarkably quiet for being in the middle of a busy city. Hotel staff are friendly and very accommodating. The courtyard is a wonderful place to just relax and either read a book or enjoy your coffee. Definitely would recommend!,2019-09-27T19:51:23Z,119
200,The Burrard,4.0,"Can't remember if we did Expedia or Hotwire to get our deal at The Burrard for a major convention this week, but I booked it based on Yelp reviews and price. Never a disappointment, our lovely Yelp...

Rate: $93/night + $20/night for parking

Cleanliness: top notch. Everything was spotless. And I mean NOTHING I could say. No little hairs on the bright white sheets. Bright, shiny all-white bathroom. New carpet. New, new, new. In an old building.

Location: Within walking distance of the Vancouver Convention Center. It took me 15 min each way, and it was a pleasant walk. Won't bother with a car if I have another convention to attend there.

Service: Some of them were nice, some were just normal. Nothing spesh and nothing to complain about.

One downer: The elevator was closed, so I had to carry everything up and down the stairs. FWIW, they were fixing the elevator when I checked out.

The hotel was booked to capacity, according to the website, and the parking garage was full on a regular basis, but I never noticed any other guests except in coming and going. Never heard a peep from anyone else.  

Our room's bathroom vent/fan was a real throwback. It was just a crank-out window.  You can hear everything going on in the alley behind the hotel, which isn't much. I saw two guys smoking pot out there when I climbed on the toilet to see what all the giggling was about one night.  Well, I thought, one can't blame them for smoking their pot when a regular sized Johnny Walker will run you $56 in Canada!!!!  And I thought Utah was horrible. I stand corrected.

The design is young and fresh. I know they are going for retro, but come on people. It was Ikea with some turquoise and yellow paint like my 1948 kitchen tile. You won't find any pink bathrooms in this building. One bit of an overdo were the tasteless ""postcards"" of the Burrard. Sorry. I'm not sending my grammy a postcard with a photo of a half nude barely legal. girl, lounging on a motel room bed with a zoolander looking skinny dude in the background trying to look like a Mad Men version of a Brazilian pimp.

Anyway. It's true, they give you a cute assortment of freebies with the Burrard logo. They even had chapstick! Even the bathroom towels had a Burrard tag, which I haven't seen since my aunt's Holiday Inn wedding reception back in the '80s. Yes, I'm that old.

So you can believe me when I tell you that aside from some of the frippery and that annoying parking charge, I'll forego those marbled wonders further down the street so I can stay at this charming, clean, refreshing little gem.",2012-03-23T06:02:39Z,119
201,The Burrard,4.0,"Not just b/c it's a major night-and-day from its previous look, but this is a chick, boutique hotel.

Lobby has funky sofas, decor real retro but all new.  Rooms a bit small due to its heritage building, and the layout not like a typical hotel setting.  More like a courtyard so when you're getting to your room, it's actually outside, with the courtyard looking down behind you.  Cool on a nice, dry night.

Pretty good rate for tonight, just $115 for King in the heart of DT.  Maybe a handful of blocks to get to the shopping core, but it's in a super safe area, convenient 7 eleven downstairs as well as their own coffee/pastry place, plus a Blenz coffee too.

includes  free wifi, bottled water & local calling, US too.

Parking's in the back, a bit tight being an older building, $20/nite.",2013-04-27T15:54:37Z,119
202,The Burrard,4.0,"Retro, funky and boutique. I brought my daughter here for a little mother-daughter night out. It's a great location with lots of restaurants and shopping within walking distance. 

We checked-in late in the evening. Service was immediate and friendly. The lobby has a hip retro feeling to it and the mini elevator in the corner is cute..although I can imagine it would be difficult to maneuver in if you had a great deal of luggage. It was rainy while we were there so we didn't enjoy the courtyard feel to the hotel. I could imagine it would be nice on a sunny day.

As with most boutique type hotels, you're going to be dealing with some older amenities with modern touches. The bathroom was older and small yet the Nespresso machine was a nice touch. 

It was mid march when we stayed and it was freezing. I never did find the thermostat or I would have cranked the heat. There was a huge gap under our door (that you could actually see daylight shining through) and cold air was blowing in. Our stay likely would have been a completely different story on a warm sunny day.

I felt as though the walls were thin and we could hear everything going on in the rooms around us (like TVs, talking and headboards bouncing off the wall...a nice one to explain to my six year old daughter).

On the morning of our checkout, I felt the maid was rushing us out so she could clean our room. 

Again, it's located well and you won't find much else in downtown for the price.",2013-05-14T16:33:46Z,119
203,The Burrard,4.0,"Pros:
-Beautifully ""thought out"", well-designed rooms
-The shower is nice and hot
-Not a boutique hotel but sure looks and feels like one (without the attitude to go with it in general)
-Excellent proximity to the best of what downtown Vancouver offers.
-Parking on hotel grounds sucks and is hard to fine, but you can park across the street in the hospital parking garage for about $2 (Canadian) less per day than at the hotel, so I parked there.
-Maybe the quirky signs in the hotel is a tribute to the film industry in Vancouver.  I dunno, but it felt strangely Hollywood-ish.  I thought that was interesting, and I live near L.A. and care nothing about the whole Hollywood ""scene,"" so go figure.
-The morning check-out guy was awesome.

Cons:
-The evening check-in guy was kind of a jerk.  He acted like he didn't like his job and I had to wait 4-5 minutes at the desk upon check-in before he even arrived.
-Elevators: slllooooooooow...
-The front desk isn't always responsive (then again, I only needed to dial 0 when Mr. Jerk was there, so...)

Minus that one guy, this is easily a 5-star hotel.  For under $110/night (in US$), this is a bargain considering that a person is staying in the heart of one of the world's most vibrant and cosmopolitan cities.  It really is a great deal!",2014-03-09T03:09:21Z,119
204,The Burrard,4.0,"I've only been to two hotels in my life so I'm not sure how credible my review will be to you experts, but this place was awesome. We walked in and were greeted by super nice people who chatted with us and told us about all the things we should do while we're in Vancouver. Upon arrival, the staff definitely made us feel like we made the right choice of hotel. The room was great. Simple, clean. Free wi-fi, free water bottles, free long-distance phone calls to anywhere in North America. They also had a huge TV mounted on the wall. I know people don't come to a different city to watch the tele, but it's a solid way to wrap up the night before falling asleep. 

The location was nice. In the heart of downtown (I think?). The buses and our feet took us everywhere we wanted to go with no problems. 

Overall I would highly recommend this place to stay. At a hundred bucks a night, it was definitely worth it. If I go back to Vancouver, I know where I'll be staying.",2012-03-31T17:07:50Z,119
205,The Burrard,4.0,"COCKROACHES and BUG BITES!Had to wait 2 days to see a manager about it.When I did, Anita said I MUST BE LYING! even though I was not asking for money or anything(just garbage bags to keep my belongings in)

This has got to be the worst service experience of my life. I feel sick thinking about it.",2013-12-27T21:30:42Z,119
206,The Burrard,4.0,"OK, admittedly, I was total grumpy pants when I checked in. A strange sequence of events led to me booking in here for one night last minute and I wasn't taking any BS from life. I showed up early hoping for an early check-in. No can do. Fine, be back at 3pm. 
Chapters free reading, Costco run for cheese and batteries (but of course!) and 2 hrs later I returned. But the room isn't ready yet! Some gripe around it not being certain and that the range was 3-4pm. But i was firmly told 3pm so i kinda moaned a bit. Then I melted on the couch cause my fee hurt. 
After about 15min I think the desk guy realized my loitering scowling presence might not be great for business so he went to check again. Another room was ready so he booked me in. 

As I got upstairs, I felt horrible cause the cleaning lady was obviously working hard and, well, i'm an ungrateful biatch with first world problems. Hey, even I admit it when i'm wrong. 

I walked into an immaculate super cute room. Things were as advertised. The coffee is a great touch and i had 2 right away (cause i'm just ridiculous sometimes) one short one long both delicious. I was also pleased that there was a mini fridge for my cheese storage!!!! HAZAH!

So props to the very well mannered and patient front desk clerks, and to the hard working cleaning lady and a big boooooo ""cry me a river"" to me. 

Just a few things to keep in mind though:
- sink is teeny tiny
- no amenities on site (other than bikes) - but you can get a pass for Fitness World
- windows look inside to the hallway so privacy and daylight cannot both be had
- the price/location attracts a younger crowd...and the set up of the hotel means noise is amplified at night...had a pretty loud evening last night",2012-12-31T06:05:40Z,119
207,The Burrard,4.0,"LOVE the Barrard!

It's kitchie and tongue and cheek.

The had some bikes that we could take for a ride on a first come first serve basis and the hotel is super cute and in a great location.

Did I mention that it was extremely affordable?!

I'd love to stay here again!",2012-02-21T04:46:09Z,119
208,The Burrard,4.0,"One of the few reasonably priced hotels in downtown Vancouver.

The building is old but,, it is newly remodeled to reflect its 1960's vintage heritage.  The rooms are small but tidy.  Big flat panel tvs in every room.  Great colour scheme and all rooms open into a lush central courtyard with parking below.

It is a great reminder of my childhood when motels were a legitimate clean alternative to over priced city hotels.  Thanks for the memories.",2012-06-01T04:46:13Z,119

Easy reservation, easy parking, easy check in (after 4pm), easy check out... EASY EASY EASY!

Not to mention, GREAT price! Only a little bit more than the hostels close by.

They offer complimentary bicycles, umbrellas, & WIFI for hotel guests.
Tons of cute quirky signs and hotel goodies.
Clean facility, Betty cafe below, 711 next door, tons of restaurants close by.

210,The Burrard,4.0,"I don't usually leave reviews but my son and I loved The Burrard so much that I needed to leave one. We stayed in March 2019 over spring break. 
First off, it's like its own little oasis in the middle of downtown Vancouver. All of the hotel room doors face the middle where it has an outdoor fireplace and a pingpong table. The front desk staff were so kind and helpful. The room was small, but very clean and comfortable. We were also able to use the free bicycles on our last day even after we had checked out. The hotel held onto our bags while we explored for a few more hours. There's also a coffee shop that's attached to the hotel for the morning, although we hit Starbucks right across the street. The hotel is central to just about everything, including a 7-11 around the corner for an ATM and restaurants nearby.
The only downfalls are that you are literally across the street from the ER at hospital. I was worried about ambulance noise throughout the night but there was an AC machine in the room for white noise so we didn't hear a thing. If you can't sleep with white noise, may not be your thing. The other downfall is parking. We parked in the hospital parking garage because it's cheaper than the hotel parking garage. But that was really our only option if we wanted to keep our car near us, which we did. The pros completely outweigh the cons! It's not your typical chain hotel, which is why we loved it. This is where we'll stay on our next trip.",2019-04-06T00:55:48Z,119
211,The Burrard,4.0,"Great things: cheap rate, location - walking distance to everything downtown, free umbrellas and bikes, spunky decor and theme, comfy bed, Nespresso coffee machine, free water, cute bag of lollies on arrival, tasteful furniture, fluffy towels, big television, quirky notes plastered everywhere... I like smaller unique hotels better than large generic chains. 

Not so great things: paper thin walls so if you're a light sleeper bring ear plugs. You're in a downtown location so it's expected. Soap dispenser things. I am all for saving the planet so I can live without the little soap bottles but those dispensers were infuriating. The lift is extremely small and slow, but it's a small hotel with only 4 floors so taking the stairs is easy enough. If you book here request a room far from the elevator because it would have been hell to be in a room facing that lift. Lastly the staff... It's a shame, when we checked in we were greeted by a wonderfully enthusiastic woman at the front desk who took the time to point out the best places for lunch and other areas of interest. She gave us an umbrella each for the rain. But that was the end of our hospitality from the staff. For the rest of our stay the front desk were weird. They were unfriendly and only interested in having conversations amongst themselves. Every time we came through the lobby they didn't even look up or bat an eye lid, just sat there staring at their screens with not a hint of acknowledgement. I had to call front desk a few times to ask about some of their services and every person I spoke to seemed annoyed and snappy. Sadly we didn't encounter the same lovely woman who checked us in. Such a shame because everything else about our stay was mostly great. It won't stop us from staying here again, the rate, location and quality of room is worth it. So I think The Burrard is worthy of 4 stars. Just wish the staff were more pleasant.",2016-01-31T13:10:30Z,119
212,The Burrard,4.0,"Received a Jaunt.ca deal for the Burrard & have not been disappointed.
It is welcoming, but with an under stated reception area.
Elevator is not big enough, but small issue overall.
Lovely courtyard and interesting look and feel with motel style doors and then modern and clean rooms.
Amusing and kitsch furnishings in the room - not totally practical for family travels, but super comfy bed.
Good to have a fridge in the room and to check in early, which was needed and no problem.
All in all, it is a funky but no fuss place to stay in a great location.",2011-09-14T03:42:43Z,119
213,The Burrard,4.0,"he Burrard was a great choice for our stay in Vancouver. 

Where to begin... The check in process was easy and our room was ready right away. Our room was clean and well decorated. There is no central air in the room, but they do have a stand alone AC unit in the room. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to consider ear plugs for sleep. 

The front desk staff was really helpful in giving advice on things to do near the hotel. The hotel is a few blocks away from shopping on Robson St, and also some really good restaurants in that area. Granville Island is only a short walk Southwest from the hotel.

Overall we were very happy with our choice. We will consider staying there again on our next visit to Vancouver.",2016-08-07T18:53:30Z,119
214,The Burrard,4.0,"Downtown, (payed) parking, nespresso (!) bikes and wifi. Clean and a very friendly staff. What more can you ask for? Excellent hotel that we would definitely recommend and we'll visit again. Plans already have been made to return to Vancouver.

Recently refurbished so everything has that nice feeling you get in fresh surroundings. Bonus is the bathroom, completely with tiles. So much better than those other solutions you often see in American/Canadian hotels. 

Because the look of the hotel has already been reviewed by so many others we'll not repeat that again.

What we would like to add is how friendly the staff is. Helping you with good directions and tips. Refilling the Nespresso cups. Looking for solutions for the full hotel at the moment we asked for an extra night. Very nice,

And a tip: our extra night directly booked with the hotel was cheaper than via hotels.com.............",2013-09-11T15:17:59Z,119
215,The Burrard,4.0,"So this is rated on the sole fact that it met what we were looking for: cheap and close to the clubs/downtown. We didn't spend much time in the room anyway. Plan was sight see all day and drink all night. 

Bad:
-Showers are iffy they go hot/cold
-Parking lot is very small (cost $10)
-Each room is different 

Good:
-Cheap
-Nice location
-7-11 under the Inn which is nice to grab late night snack and hangover recovery water
-A coffee shop located under the Inn for the morning coffee
-There is a nice outdoor section.

I would recommend this place to college kids looking for a decent place within walking distance to the nightlife.",2011-01-08T05:19:10Z,119

Free wifi worked great and the TV was huge (great for watching the Olympics).  It was super hot this weekend, so I was dreaming of a pool.... The one thing that I didn't like was the eco-friendly air cooler--- it didn't really cool the air, so we were boiling all day and night. 
We would definitely stay here again! It is near food, shops and a short walk to the waterfront. The people here were also very polite!",2012-08-09T20:06:34Z,119

Great location - close to  Grandville island & Stanley Park; and yes love the 7-11 & coffee shop right down stairs. Wish there's  a cafe or bistro restaurant in the building but there are tons of eateries within walking distance. I would have given it a 5 star if not because of the lack of a/c and the lack of dimming lights in the room.

Oh the street noise is pretty prominent but that's what you get when you stay in the city. It didn't bother us too much.",2012-04-01T09:55:10Z,119

221,The Burrard,4.0,"This hotel is definitely everything the great reviews have been talking about.  We just recently visited Vancouver for the first time, on a road trip up from the states.  We were looking for something affordable but nice.  That's a hard combo to pin down, and this hotel makes it happen.

Great location, comfortable bed, quiet room (top floor by request), clean-clean-clean, friendly, accommodating staff, small perks (free wifi, nespresso machine), and a beautiful tropical central courtyard with huge trees.

You're not going to get any room service here, but it is so close to restaurants that you don't need it.

Helpful hint: If you book reservations online and add a name for an additional guest, be prepared to offer that name when you check in - there is some kind of glitch and our reservations were under this second name.",2014-04-13T02:01:44Z,119
222,The Burrard,4.0,"Stayed for New Years 2012. Reserved about a month ahead time, although we waited a couple days and saw the price drop down from $100+ to $70/night. 

The place was retro-hip inside, the front desk was super helpful and even call us a cab for our dinner, and the rooms worked for the price. 

The queen room was a little small, the carpets were office styled, and the hot water was warm at best. But for $70USD on new years in the middle of downtown we knew the hotel wasn't going to be the Four Seasons. Surprisingly, the area was quiet for being a holiday and across from the hospital. Room came w a handy 42"" LG HDTV, an espresso maker, and free water.

Id highly recommend this hotel for budget trips, its location and amenities, and friendly staff. Thank you for having us, will be back soon!",2012-02-24T08:00:07Z,119
223,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Really enjoyable stay at the upscale Hyatt Regency in downtown Vancouver.

We wanted to stay a bit longer after our Los Angeles to Vancouver April cruise, so got a 3 night stay at this Hyatt.   Marriott has done a number on me in maintaining my loyalty (both timeshare ownership and lifetime status), but Hyatt's point redemption value is at LEAST twice as good, and with their partnership with Chase Ultimate Rewards, it's worth always checking to see if a particular destination has a usable Hyatt.  Vancouver did, so to maximize our stay, got a Hyatt Chase Credit Card to automatically get status (Hyatt Discoverist).  It got us an upgraded room, complementary high-speed internet, daily bottled water coming in aluminum bottles, and late checkout.

We got in early on a Friday to the Vancouver cruise port, and it was a 5 block walk to the hotel.  They let us pre-check-in at 8, letting us know that we would get a text when our room was ready.  They have a large room where you can store your bags (before or after your stay).  We noticed later that the room ran out of space, so were using part of the lobby space (near the rental car counter) to keep tagged bags (with a dedicated attendant standing watch over it).   The hotel is connected to the shopping mall (Royal Centre).  It has a food court in the lower floor, and some of them were open during the morning hours.  We got to notice all this while staying around the area.  Our room was ready by 2 pm, so went back to reception, got our key, and went to our room.

It's a nice, large room with two Queen beds, a 65 inch flat screen TV with most of the basic cable channels.  There was a large desk with plenty of space for my laptop, a comfortable chair, and plenty of outlets.  They offer two terry cloth robes for use, and the towels seem to be using Egyptian cotton? (i.e. very thick).  We were on the 23rd floor, and could see the outdoor swimming pool directly below us (there is no balcony and the windows don't open).  Plenty of storage space.  The temperature controls worked well, and we were very comfortable during our stay.  There is a small mini refrigerator and a small pod coffee maker.  There is no way to heat up your food.

We got to use a 'destination dispatch' type elevator for the first time at this hotel.  There is an touchscreen console near the elevator where you would expect the up/down call button would be.  You pick the floor you want to go to, and it will tell you which elevator to get on (A - E).  The elevator comes, you get on, and that's it.  On the side of the doorway, you can see which floors the elevator is slated to stop at and a display telling you which you are on)...but no buttons to tell the elevator where to go. (Hopefully there is a 'panic' button for somebody who didn't pick a floor to still be let off).  It was really efficient.   I didn't know if it had a load sensor, but assuming it did (since it did not ask for how many people needed to get on the elevator).  We had just gotten off a cruise ship where waiting for an elevator (and seeing multiple fully full ones stop without being able to pick you up) was a daily aggravation (I know...first world problems...)

Housekeeping was good throughout.  We usually don't ask for housekeeping for a short stay (funny that rather than have to pick up a little bit before the housekeeper comes in, we just prefer to reuse our towels and live with our messiness), but this time, I really wanted to get my two bottled waters (complementary) because it came in those really cool aluminum reusable bottles.  I wasn't sure housekeeping would feel insulted if I gave loose US currency each day as tip, but they didn't seem to mind.

Got to use the workout gym everyday, and it's a good one, with plenty of treadmills and ellipticals and strength machines, along with free weights. One big no-no was the alcohol wipes used to wipe down the machines, was empty on one of the days I visited.   They should have more than one dispenser to prevent that.

For our final day (Monday), we were able to checkout a bit later (till 2 pm instead of the typical noon) because of the aforementioned status, so actually enjoyed the full solar eclipse across the US by watching CNN from our room (it was cloudy and rainy in Vancouver).  We picked up a Lyft to the airport from the hotel (it was raining so didn't want to take the train with luggage), costing under $30 CAD and go there via local roads within 45 minutes.

I got my final invoice the same day of check-out, and there was no balance on it (using points means tax and resort fees are taken care of as part of the points usage).  Always nice not to have a hotel bill after your vacation.",2024-04-09T22:26:59Z,308
224,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"First stay in a Hyatt. The beds are fulls (I think?) and not queens. We just came from Victoria (HGP) and beds were def larger, so this was a letdown. We have two kids 5/9 and we are both 5 foot 9/10 and our bed felt small and also kinda taco-y (depressed in middle). 

I have ""discoverist"" status due to biz card but when I arrived the guy at check in apologized and said he'd have to put us in a lower room instead of higher ""due to busyness"". I honestly wouldn't have known the difference but the apology made me feel let down. That status only gets you water and late checkout, which we did not need. i got status from a recently acquired hyatt credit card. 

I got a text the day before arriving offering any help I needed via their text system. When I checked in Kenneth told me he'd logged in the system to bring more towels and waters up. They never arrived. I texted later asking for more pillows and got an immediate reply saying my ""request would be accommodated in 15 minutes."" 2 hours later I had to text again, and they forgot the pillows and the waters. Bummer.

Lobby was being transitioned to non-Christmas so it was pretty empty. Elevator wait was pretty long given the crowds, I even took the stairs once due to the wait. 8 floors was a workout! 

Room cleaning. We didn't request it but also weren't warned they wouldn't clean. Last hotel (Victoria) they did, either way, clear communication on this point would be best. UPDATE: the maid came at 5:30pm and apologized saying they were understaffed. She insisted on cleaning the bathroom while we were relaxing in the room. The next two days we missed cleaning because they came late when we were in the room already. 

Our room was a good size and felt clean and modern. there was a mini fridge. 

We were on floor 8 on the poolside which was a bit loud but not after 10 when it closes. 

Parking: there is paid parking in the attached lot.

There is a Tim Hortons, Starbucks and McDonald's right in/next to the hotel.

Overall a fine hotel but no frills or real extras other than gym/pool/hot tub. Central to the things we wanted to do and also right next to a metro stop.

The Good:
Room is spacious and modern. Nice gym. Outdoor heated pool and spa. Robes in room. Fridge in room.",2024-01-17T02:09:53Z,308
225,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Stayed at the Hyatt Regency Vancouver for two nights while visiting the city. First off, it's in a fantastic location downtown. A number of areas that are worth checking out, especially as a visitor, are within walking distance or even a short car ride. For example, it's right by Stanley Park as well as the water and Chinatown and Little Italy are within a reasonable walking distance. 

The hotel itself is nice. Check in was friendly and efficient, and navigating the elevators and rooms was easy. Although we booked for a king, we arrived at 9am and the hotel was willing to accomodate us right away in a double room they had clean and available. We didn't mind this as we prioritized having a room in general vs having our preferred room so this was nice to be able to fully check in so early in the morning. 

The room was spacious and pretty modern. All the standard features of most hotels were available - flat screen TV, desk and office chair, etc. They also had two suitcase holders which was really nice so we could prop up both our suitcases. 

We honestly didn't spent too much time in the hotel as we were out exploring but everything we experienced was nice. Additional staff members were friendly and greeted us with a smile as we walked by and the whole stay was smooth and welcoming.",2023-11-29T23:59:43Z,308
226,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Stayed here for 5 nights with our toddler in a king bedroom in the upper floors. Everything from the check in process to getting help navigating the city, was so easy. The staff here is amazing. So kind and helpful and they literally all went above and beyond to help us with easy question we had or assistance we needed. It's so centrally located that we didn't need to rent a car. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. I would happily stay here again.",2024-04-09T05:03:01Z,308
227,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Stayed here for two nights before our big Disney Cruise Line cruise to Hawaii (October 2023). The location was great, lots of shops and restaurants nearby, we only ubered to Granville Island and the cruise terminal. 

The Starbucks in the lobby was great and useful to us and we ate at one of their restaurants one night.

All of the employees were nice and helpful ... it was raining the day we went to Granville Island and we could borrow umbrellas from the hotel (we borrowed from the bell services person in the lobby, but we later found out that there was one umbrella in the room).

I would stay here again...I've only ever stayed in the Richmond area before, and loved the location and closeness to Robson st!",2023-11-11T06:45:30Z,308
228,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"This is your fairly typical upscale high rise downtown hotel. Everything is modern and well maintained, but lacking in any particular esthetic comfort. It's located right next door to a Skytrain Station, which is most convenient. If you don't want to spend $39 for the buffet breakfast, there is a Mcdonald's and a Tim Horton's right next door where you can get an inexpensive meal. The one thing that I found unusually innovative here were the fully automated elevators, the likes of which I have never seen anywhere else before. You press the floor that you want to go to, insert your room key, and then it instructs you which elevator to get on and that elevator takes you directly to your floor. There is no panel inside the elevator to use.",2023-11-07T19:44:54Z,308
229,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"I'm always searching for ways to give a lodging a five-star review, but I rarely ever do.  There's always something: problems with cleanliness, worn furnishings, sneaky junk fees, etc.

This Hyatt, however, deserves a rare five-star-hotel rating.  Why?

* Extremely quick and polite check-in. When the gentleman asked if I'd ever stayed at the hotel before, and I replied I'd never been to Vancouver before, he handed me a free breakfast ticket and said ""welcome to Vancouver.""

* Extra-comfortable bed. And while the hotel is older and the room decor wasn't to-the-moment contemporary, the room was clean and in great shape.

* Excellent views from the balcony of the surrounding neighborhood.

* Super super damn convenient to everything: Burrard Metro stop is a block away, meaning airport is extremely easy to get to & from. Buses on nearby streets run every 5 or so minutes.  Bikeshare just around the corner. Etc.

* The Most Efficient Elevator Concept Ever: I've heard of these but never experienced one.  You enter your destination before getting in, the AI analyzes the current usage patterns, floors, etc., and tells you which elevator to wait for. Get in the elevator -- which only has buttons for Open, Close, and HelpTheCableBrokeAndTheBuildingIsOnFire, and head, usually directly, to your floor.  It's the future, man.

* The restaurant (of free breakfast fame) had an excellent buffet and the Grain Tasting Bar had a lot of great Canadian beverages for tasting as well as nice views of the area through its open windows.

Only minor complaint was that, even up on the 21st floor, sirens and guys doing their best Honda Civic fast-n-furious imitations were audible during the night.  So I'll deduct down to 4 1/2 stars, which still rounds up to 5.

When in Vancouver again, I'll be back here.",2023-08-18T17:24:27Z,308
230,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"We had a good stay here at the Hyatt Regency in Vancouver. The staff were all friendly and the rooms were nice and clean. The location was great, and I would definitely recommend staying here when in Vancouver.",2024-03-10T18:33:39Z,308
231,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"My boyfriend and I stayed here earlier this month and thoroughly enjoyed it. The package we got included a high floor room with King bed, city view, daily breakfast buffet included and a daily $25 credit to spend in any of their restaurants or Starbucks, parking or room service. 

Food: We went down to the buffet for breakfast each morning and saved lots of money from not having to eat out. I liked that they serve breakfast until 11am so we had a later breakfast each day then went out and about on our days. Didn't even have to have lunch! The daily buffet was really good food, fresh, lots of variety of cold cuts, fresh fruit, hot oatmeal, scrambled eggs, turkey sausge (so good), sauteed veggies, roasted baby potatoes (my fav) and an omelette bar... among other items like bakery items, bread for toast coffee, juices. We had one dinner at their Mosaic grill (?) restaurant, my boyfriend's steak was good and my salmon was ok. If we didn't have the credits to use I would spend the money elsewhere on a better dinner. However, the staff at the mosaic grill and daily breakfast staff were extremely nice and friendly. 

Customer service: the hotel staff including housekeeping, servers, front desk, bell man were all so nice and genuine. The elevators are secure and very technologically advanced.

We went to the pool once (it was too cold lol) and the hot tub each night. There were barely any people there, it was so nice. Would highly recommend this hotel.",2022-10-21T21:31:49Z,308

Friendly service and a ""rooftop"" pool/ hot tub makes this a winner. Our room was on the 23rd floor with a balcony over looking the pool area provided a great view of the city ( minus a few high rises). Walls were pretty thin, but I've been to enough hotels to know that thin walls are pretty standard.

We were able to check in at 9 am and check out at 2 pm the following day, which alleviated some of the hassle of traveling. Totally appreciated and definitely recommend to anyone!",2016-05-09T08:37:11Z,308

I stayed here for 3 nights from Jan 1 to 4th. I had a great way of starting 2019 !!!! 

If you like firm mattress, be cautious. 

After 3 nights here, we moved to Hyatt in Seattle. It was REALLY NICE. I won't stay at  any Regency again.",2019-02-02T10:58:20Z,308

We got our rooms mixed up and received two beds instead of one King size bed; they gladly upgraded the us. The view was amazing from our room and overlooked a lot of the city. The concierge was extremely helpful when looking for a grocery store. 

My only complaint was the air conditioner did not work properly and it got quite hot in the room. Other than that, I would be excited to stay at this place again.",2017-07-15T00:47:10Z,308

238,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"The 5-stars are not given for the accommodations and amenities (although they do warrant a high rating), but for the staff and team members we came into contact with during our stay from the moment we drove up to the curbside loading, front desk check-in (too early), interaction with concierge and baggage storage, the welcoming (6-days!) by the business lounge, car valet guys, and the housekeeping wonder-team. All spot on friendly, courteous, problem solving, suggestive, creative, and geniunely great people. As Vancouver was just a stop over back to the US after a week of skiing in Kelowna, the Hyatt Hotel was the perfect partner in keeping my family safe and well tended. The location was perfect for shopping, bites, train rides to sites, and for access to all roads to everywhere. 

The rooms were very clean and modern and no short for any toiletries and drinks. The internet was the fastest we've ever encountered at a hotel. Very modern elevator system makes transport fast without much waiting time.
And to think, we didn't even use the Starbucks in the lobby once! But good to know it was there. 

We received a wonderful club access rate directly from the Hyatt site. Great value. Just know that alcohol is based on an honor system as we learned it is illegal for hotels to give out free alcoholic drinks. The club access breakfast, snacks, and light evening appetizers were ample and fully stocked.",2018-03-29T20:16:18Z,308

The spa hot tub is great although I wish it didn't close at 10pm. The parking rate seems really high but I know the Hyatt doesn't have control over that and it's still worth staying at this hotel!",2018-03-09T19:55:08Z,308
241,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"I don't write 5 star reviews often. In fact, I'm usually too lazy to write reviews at all but in this case, let me tell you what a gem the Hyatt Regency Vancouver is. 

First, I travel a fair amount in the US, EU and have stayed at Hyatt properties many times. It's a good, business class hotel with consistent amenities, nice, clean rooms and acceptable service in each property  that I've stayed in in the past. However, the Vancouver property is special. 

Let me start with the people. From the moment you arrive, the employees are kind, warm, sincere and extremely helpful. I was in town for 1/2 work, 1/2 attending my daughter's NA Irish Dance championship hence I arrived a day before my wife and daughter on two different reservations. On checkin, I asked if we could get the two rooms together. They didn't have the rooms ready side by side yet but told me to just leave my bags in the first room and they would move them for me. Any you know what? They did. Next day after work, my bags were there, divider door open and I had a single key card that unlocked both doors. I then went to the bar to wait on my family to arrive at the train station right across the street. The bartender, I wish I remembered her name was awesome. The next day, I went down to the business center to print concert tickets I planned to surprise my daughter with after she finished competing. I had my Brompton bike in tow (Stanley Park two days in a row, so lucky!!) and asked if the concierge could watch it for me for just a couple minutes. I walk into the business center, and a gentleman from the front desk greets me with a claim check. ""Oh, I'll only be a minute"" I said as I was pleased to find I could print right from my iPhone. ""Take all then time you need, sir.""  I went back to the desk and asked the same gentleman if he could keep the tickets I just printed there for me while I go on my ride. ""Sir, can we have someone slip these under the door for you."" Will yes, that would be so helpful. Thank you. 

As I'm walking out, the bellman, very nice man (El - something, again I'm terrible with names) noticed I had a bike and overheard I had family coming in. ""Sir, I couldn't help but overhear that your family will be joining us tonight and I see you have a bicycle of your own- would your wife and daughter like a $5 off coupon to the local bike rental?"" Well, yes. That would be lovely, thank you. Now, I know he probably gets a kickback but there's nothing wrong with that. He was not pushy or trying to sell me something, just offering to help Andy Wednesday while I was at work my wife and daughter joined their friends for a lovely ride around Stanley Park (did I mention how spectacular that loop is?). 

As you can see, it's the people and all the little things they got so right that make this probably the best hotel stay that I can remember (OK, the Four Seasons is nice but it's been a while). This Hyatt should be the flagship bar for all other properties to hit. If every Hyatt was this good, I'd honestly never stay anywhere else. 

Thank you to the management and people for a truly exceptional stay.

242,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"This is a great hotel downtown, but the building is definitely aging.  I'd recommend booking based on category and neighborhood using Hotwire rather than pay full price here.

Convenient to have a Starbucks in the basement and be right in the middle of the city.  If you can get a deal under $275 per night go for it!  Otherwise, shop on.",2016-07-02T22:34:20Z,308
243,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"We stayed here for two nights before a cruise last summer - other than the price (not super cheap), I have no real complaints. And technically, we didn't pay with cash, we paid with Chase credit card points, so with hotels *everywhere* pretty expensive in Vancouver, we basically got to stay in a nice hotel for the price of a ""cheaper"" one by using points, thanks Chase! 

So yeah, not a particularly *interesting* review, but I've got nothing bad to say. Checkin took 2 minutes, room was pretty big, bed was pretty comfortable, the room had a nice-sized desk with tons of outlets (both regular and usb!), plenty of clothing storage spage, a full size bathroom with a great shower, everything was working properly, wifi was reliable and fast. (Can't speak to the bedding, I'm picky, so I just bring my own. :p) And, granted luck of the draw, but our normal-priced (not upgraded) room had a pretty good city view, too! 

Coming from the airport by train, it was a 3 block was the train station to the hotel, and leaving by cruise ship, again was about 3 blocks walk to the cruise terminal (which was convenient, since it was also drizzling  both days.) There was even a great bike rental a block away. Again, other than how much I would say this would depend entirely on exactly how much it cost at the time (and whether Chase was paying for it for me!), but apart from that, I had no complaints and would stay there again for sure. Which I would like to - Vancouver absolutely had far more amazing restaurants than I could explore in a day and change!",2022-12-25T01:15:30Z,308

Have to ask for towels each day, but they were prompt. Everyone we encountered was kind. We also have a nice view of the city from our room. Elevators were super easy to use and very modern - - really didn't have to wait or push others aside when getting on or off the elevator because of its tracking system.

WHAT? Am I wrong in thinking that is completely inappropriate? Their terrible service and the lying about the fact that they are accessible is not something that they have changed. I still experienced it and it completely ruined our stay there. Ahh!",2022-10-07T00:54:59Z,308

He gave us instructions on booking so we can choose to stay at the Hyatt for our entire time in Canada and about all the guest services we can take advantage of such as the suspension bridge shuttle and the coupon offered by guest services.
 The room was clean and spacious, the robe was comfortable, very clean, and loved the toiletries! Located centrally to everything so you can walk to all your destinations.

250,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"I'm giving the staff of the hotel five stars. Only four for the hotel as they close down Starbucks at 4:00, don't open the bar and grill until after 5:00 and set hours for the dining room. I don't understand why this high-end Hotel doesn't have a small 24-hour cafe or even a gift shop. The bed was not particularly comfortable, the pillows.. if you stacked three of them on top of one another it worked okay. I let housekeeping know that the pillows are terrible and did they have anything else. Just a heads up for future Travelers you can ask if they have any foam pillows which I was able to get after 5 days. The sheets, towels and toilet tissue were all rough. So, if you needed to exfoliate this was a good way to go. LOL I would not stay there again as downtown Vancouver shuts down very early and there are no close by restaurants or cafes. Interesting that underneath the hotel there was a food court that reminded me of the one in Washington DC at Union station. Although, not as upscale but, in a pinch it was better than nothing. It also closed between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. I really would like to go back to Canada and visit Richmond, Granville and victoria. My friend and I did do a lot of walking and we're so amazed that there were so many skyscrapers everywhere so close together and still building. We had planned to go to Chinatown and was informed by concierge and a few locals that it was unsafe to go there these days. I asked about Japantown and apparently it has become a very tiny and not authentic anymore. I was very surprised too not see many historical sites. We did go to the Marine building and Fairmont hotel which I will post later. We came across a very large Memorial at a fenced off building. I posted a few photos here it has to do with what they called residential schools for the Indians of Canada. Thousands of genocide victims all children and they're still finding them in different burial sites at these schools. I'm not going to get into it here but you can look it up online if you're interested. It is mind boggling to say the least. The weather was perfect just like San Diego LOL 2 days before we left the temperature dropped about 10° but still very comfortable and refreshing.

The rooms were immaculate, and the food for our pregame meal was some of the best we've ever had.

Sarah Han, the event manager was outstanding -  so accommodating and patient. She went above and beyond to make sure everything was ready for us in the rooms and meeting spaces. Thank you so much for working with us, Sarah! We look forward to returning.",2023-06-18T16:11:25Z,308

261,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"I recently stayed at Hyatt Vancouver Regency from Mar 24 - Mar 28 and noticed unauthorized charges on my account. I believe that the hotel staff rebooked my prepaid reservations at a higher rate without my consent or knowledge to accommodate my request for rooms to be next to each other. I am disappointed with this unethical practice and the inconvenience it has caused. I have contacted the hotel multiple times to address this matter. Overall, this has been a disappointing experience, and it makes me reconsider staying at Hyatt hotels in the future.",2023-04-01T20:16:29Z,308
262,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt in May 2021 (Covid season) and we were one of 6 guests in the entire hotel. As a result of low occupancy, the water system was messed up and there was only hot water - too hot to jump into the shower. Instead of a romantic night to celebrate our 25th anniversary, it became an issue of how fast can we get away from the hotel. 

As compensation we were gifted another night. Now we're using the hotel gift receipt and was given a room directly by the elevator, with a crap view. 

The rooms are tired; we've stayed on and off several times for the past 25 years and this is the absolute last straw. We will never stay here again, and never recommend the Hyatt Regency.",2022-04-23T23:55:35Z,308

The restaurant opens at 7am and is good, starbucks opens at 6 in the lobby. There's a 24 hour mcdonalds on the other side of the driveway and tim Hortons. Ordered room service a few times.

Walking distance to the cruise terminal and the seawall.

Excellent service in all regards - Eddie at the concierge desk was marvelous.

Comfortable room with a great shower and balcony view was our experience.  

Mosaic restaurant for brunch was excellent, with omelette station, breads, smoked salmon, cheese station, and self serve breakfast staples.

Grain whiskey bar was excellent, with knowledgeable staff on whiskey topics.",2022-08-06T18:48:58Z,308
266,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Baci!!! Travels for Baci!! Pet hotels #19!!

Since we've been doing a lot of four seasons and fairmont chains, decided to try the Hyatt with Baci! Normally, Hyatt is my goto with points and membership perks!! Now Baci get to try it! 

Sooo! Vancouver downtown is kinda like downtown Seattle. Impossible to park/find parking / expensive overnight. The hotel valet suggested I park in the garage right through the hotel valet: it's used for restaurants/ shops etc and which would be cheaper. Ended up being $24 for a whole day/night. Valet was $42 I believe. Thanks, Valet dude! 


Normally pet floors are lower but I love high floors and well platinum membership got us a room on 20th. It rained the whole time but we enjoyed staying in and hanging out in the balcony. People watched in the rain and cold! 

The bed was comfortable. Room was nice size: a little on the smaller side. Just a tiny bit but still nice. Roomy. Baci love the bed and the couch! :) 

The lobby has Starbucks, a bar and hangout area with plenty of umbrellas for that crazy rainy weekend. We walked around in the evening for a bit but coming back was the best part! Especially for Baci. He doesn't care for the rain. 

The only complain was lack of microwave for my pups food. The room service can come and get it and do it for you. But seems like too much hassle. Ended up ordering new rice for his meals. A lot of food deliveries were ordered too!

And that 2 pm check out! Great for us to explore the Robson street the next day, walk the Canada place and the harbor. All within 5 -10 minutes walk!! Baci loved it so, I did too! Woof woof!",2019-10-08T04:38:13Z,308

If you are traveling from the airport, just hop on the blue line and get off at the city center stop. Train station is just a few blocks away and saves you tons of money on Uber/cab. Hotel itself is gorgeous and has a great variety of places to spend time in. Also loved the gym!",2022-04-24T21:53:19Z,308
269,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Wow! This place is well worth the price I paid for this room. 

It is located in the center of the city. You can easily get around town from this hotel. For those out of town, you'll possibly need a taxi to get around... good thing there is one waiting at the lobby most of the time. 

4/5 The room is well above average. The only way you get a better room is in Vegas or a suite

5/5 the room came with a sick view of the city skyline

5/5 gym this is in my top 10 for hotels",2020-01-27T06:31:28Z,308
270,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Very comfortable rooms and a great central location (you can walk or take transit to most destinations in Vancouver --- you dont need a car).  One downside - if you are a light sleeper you'll hear people in adjacent rooms and above (also all the doors slam HARD). The location and interior are great, the noise level is not ideal.",2022-11-27T04:06:11Z,308
271,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"The hotel's location is perfect to walk around the city.  Everyone that I interacted at the hotel was friendly, kind, and polite.

I received awesome upgrade to the room on the 33rd floor and nice welcome amenity was delivered upon check-in.  I believe the hotel has been around for a while, but the room was not showing dated sign at all.  I liked imitation fireplace that I had in my room!

Since my stay was short, I did not have a chance to explore lots of hotel facilities, but I am definitely coming back again - hopefully to stay longer next time!",2019-01-22T05:04:35Z,308
272,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Booked a room here through hotels.com which made check-in super quick and easy. Had a king room with a city view, and it was during the holidays so the lobby was decked out with gingerbread houses and festive lights. The lobby had a small bar that was great for grabbing a quick drink. The accessibility to walk around the city was fantastic!! Especially since they don't have uber in Vancouver yet we mostly walked everywhere.

As for the rooms, we were on one of the newly remodeled floors. The floor itself was very updated and modern, the room was a good size as well. However for it to be newly renovated I expected the bathroom to be nicer. And for me my top 3 things for a hotel room are bathroom, bed quality and view. I was able to check two of those things off which I suppose is good. I would recommend this hotel if you are traveling to the area, it's affordable and a great location! Perfect for family trips or a couples getaway.",2019-02-21T17:45:23Z,308
273,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Wonderful customer service when we arrived. Also the room service employees were very kind and turned down our room every day without request.

274,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Before visiting I had concerns because it was hard to get a hold of someone on the phone. When I did it felt like they just wanted to get you off the phone. However, upon arriving the service was friendly at both the reception and the guest service desks. The room service is one of the best services we've experienced across hotels. The room service folks not only do an excellent job they seem happy as well which is a breath of fresh air. We are impressed and pleased by that. The bathroom is nice with great water pressure and a nice shower head.  The server at Grain downstairs was great as well and gave us tips about areas in Vancouver to see. It's a nice feel sitting along the street side with the elevated seating. There is a small outdoor pool and jacuzzi that is open until 10pm with a 24 hour gym. The wifi is a bit slow for video streaming and you can hear noise from the street right in downtown. It is right next to a skytrain station and a commenter convenient 8 min walk to many stores. We are on the 17th floor with a great view of the city and a peak to the harbor.",2022-08-23T02:14:27Z,308

We will definitely be back!",2022-09-05T15:36:17Z,308
276,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"The Hyatt Regency is a pretty solid option for centrally located hotels in downtown Vancouver. 

I don't ask for much when it comes to hotels - a quiet, clean, decently spacious room is all that i really look for. I got a room on the 25th floor, and the view was great. The room was clean, and housekeeping was friendly. 

My biggest gripe with my room was that it had a connecting door to the next room through which there is zero sound proofing, and I could hear every single word of conversation from the next room. Not fun. I would've asked for a new room, but everyone else was too lazy to repack to move. 

The fitness center also is on the smaller side and lacking in equipment. You can get some decent cardio in, but they don't have a comprehensive collection of machines to get a good workout in if you're more into strength training. 

Otherwise, I think this hotel is a pretty solid choice and I would stay here again.",2022-08-31T20:02:00Z,308
277,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"I initially booked this hotel because it was rated highly for cleanliness as a 4.5 star hotel. Frankly, my experience reminded me of what I imagine staying at a 3 star hotel is like. 

Cleanliness 2/5 - on the surface things looked clean, but it didn't take long at all to discover just how gross the room really was. Opening drawers there were used, empty drink containers. Hair in the bathtub and bathroom that wasn't mine. Used q-tips and other garbage behind the night stand. Remote with literal dust buildup all over it. It was gross and I made sure to self-sanitize as much as possible. 

Service 2/5 - The front desk lady was great and allowed me to check in early and gave me a free upgrade (though see above for how that actually worked out). Service went downhill from there. In the 4 days of my stay no one from room service came to clean. Literally NOT ONCE! I did hear them loudly talking and banging things in rooms nearby though on some mornings. I would say hi to staff sometimes to not be greeted back at all. I actually visited guest services to discuss these various issues but there was no one around to help on more than one occasion. 

Food N/A - Not only was there no room service and I was instructed to ""use Uber Eats,"" but the Starbucks in the lobby didn't even offer food. 

Covid-19 Protocol 3/5 - BC is under provincial order to wear masks indoors. This was followed carefully by all staff members. Guests on the other hand were hit or miss. 

Location 5/5 - This hotel really is close to everything and the view from the 29th floor was spectacular. It's in the heart of downtown close to coal harbour and a few blocks (walking) to the Convention Centers/ waterfront/ sea wall. About 20 mins walking from the Stanley Park walk. It's close to a few restaurants, a drug store, and a shopping area downtown. There is a free shuttle to Capilano bridge that stops right outside of the hotel. It's also steps away from a mass public transit station and directly across from the historic Christ Church. 

All in all, if you only care about convenience/ proximity to a few things this is the place for you. I was highly uncomfortable with the amount of unmasked guests walking around, the filth in my room, and the general lack of comfort using my bed or in the shower. I actually opted to spend the rest of my stay at the Rosewood Hotel Georgia which was exquisite!! A MAJOR upgrade from the Hyatt Regency in every way - even location. I guess .5 stars makes all the difference.",2021-08-28T13:37:43Z,308
278,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Hotel as a great location rooms are comfortable everything is very clean and the employees are very courteous and helpful.

We would definitely stay here again.",2022-09-04T03:18:54Z,308
279,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Excellent hotel in the heart of Vancouver! 

My mom and I took a girls weekend trip up to Canada and booked this hotel with the hopes we wouldn't need a car - we were right! It's a beautiful hotel walking distance to Stanley park, Vancouver harbor and Gastown - as well as the tourism welcome office!

Our room had amazing views of both the mountains and harbor - also had wonderfully comfortable beds, plenty of plugs for our electronics and a fantastic waterfall shower head - basically my perfect hotel.


We upgraded to the Regency club and it was exceptional! Every day we would start with the fantastic breakfast spread and enjoy conversations with the lovely staff - the ladies were so welcoming and personable! Basically like our own guides! They would see us at breakfast and wish us well for the day, then we'd return after our adventure for a bit of the happy hour type spread and they'd ask us all about how our day went... like they were genuinely interested! By the end of our stay, we felt like old friends! Highly recommend this upgrade! It's more than worth it!!!

An added bonus of staying at the Hyatt was also that tour busses stop at the Hyatt every day - including the free bus to Capilano suspension bridge! (Highly recommended! Stop by the front desk and they will give you an admission coupon as well!) 

Also, the front desk will exchange currency for you if you'd like - this is a beautiful option because they'll do it for you any time!

All in all, I would absolutely stay here again!
I don't think I could have asked for more from this lovely hotel - we had a very active trip and loved coming back to this gem at the end of the day. I'll be back!",2018-05-05T17:28:50Z,308
280,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Very nice and modern hotel. The staff was very friendly and informative. Complimentary wi-fi. Elevator system is nice and technical - you select where you're going before getting into the elevator and it tells you which elevator that will whisk you to your floor. Room is very nice. We got one with a balcony. Thr city view with mountains in the background at sunset/disk is beautiful. Bed is very comfy, and the pillows are wonderful. The shower is spectacular. It's an overhead rainfall shower with great water pressure. The bathroom mirror has a section that does not fog up. Their breakfast buffet is really good. It has a cold cuts station, pastries and fruit, hot station, and made to order omlet station. Enjoyed our stay.",2022-08-06T14:56:45Z,308
281,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Stayed here recently, so as you arrive be sure to have your mind made up if you plan on doing valet or self park. I knew when arriving that my ride would be too tall for the hotel garage so I was able to self park at Royal Centre. Hotel valet was about $45 per night, self park at Royal Centre is about $20 per night over the weekend. Self park (underground) is just on the backside of the hotel so you wont be driving around forever trying to find it. Entrance for self park is on Melville St and the height clearance is pretty tall. There's also hotel entrance from the self park area.  It was real easy.

As we were checking in, hotel staff was very friendly with greetings, directing you to front desk, if you need to drop off luggage for them to hold before checking in, concierge questions, all that stuff.  Hotel was very busy that weekend with large tour groups but staff kept cool and checking-in was pretty easy. 

No buttons in the elevator so be sure you hit up the touchscreen business before you enter the lift. Lift to your room is a little different, scan your room key card before you enter the elevator on the touchscreen, enter which floor you are going to, the touchscreen will tell you which elevator bay to go to. 

Room itself was pretty nice, clean (I checked the sheets and under), great view from the 32nd floor (didn't see any hanky panky from other nearby buildings), bathroom was clean, rainfall effect when showering, plenty of fresh towels, good closet space to hang and store your stuff, a mini fridge to keep your drinks & snacks cold, tv was large, nice desk to work from, good amount of plugs, AC settings, different lighting options in the room if you the amorous tourist, and most importantly WiFi worked liked a charm. Also there's a Starbucks downstairs.

Only thing that bothered me a little was in the middle of the night the walls seemed thin and I could hear a lot of things such as, upstairs walking, hallway stuff, and neighbor lady wanting her man friend to fill her with stuff.

Overall, it was a pretty good stay, location is central to a lot of stuff so the walk score to attractions is high. I typically prefer smaller boutique hotels because I'm stuck up like that, but for this hotel being a huge chain it was fine and would consider staying again.",2017-08-28T14:49:35Z,308

285,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"I didn't stay at the Hyatt Regency, but I did spend a lot of time here for a crime writers' conference at the end of March. It was a totally normal, pleasant conference hotel, with large conference and banquet rooms and a couple of places to eat and drink.

The public spaces were nice and clean, the large, windowless, carpeted, overlit conference rooms only as depressing as every other I've ever been in. There was a book room, where you could buy books and have them signed by authors after panels. There was another room for a welcome reception with a snack buffet, and another for the conference banquet (I'm not confident that this wasn't the same room, actually). The food was fine, as in kind of bad, but not terrible, about par for the course for this sort of thing. I think there was salad and choice of entree and dessert for dinner. I had the chicken and ate half of it, which was enough that I didn't go hungry. I also hung out a bunch at Mosaic and Grain, the hotel bars/restaurants. I liked Mosaic better, but both provided alcohol, which was the important thing.

Location was good, and I think the rates were fine, too. I ended up staying elsewhere but it wasn't far away. I can't speak to the hotel rooms at the Hyatt Regency, but I thought it was a perfectly decent conference hotel, if that happens to be what you need.",2019-05-23T21:19:56Z,308
286,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Clean units, friendly staff. I've stayed here a few times now and have had great experiences. This is also the first time I've had my dog stay with me too. Pet friendly!

The only thing I don't like is the parking because the space is actually shared with the retail side of the building as well so it gets packed mid-day. 

Another plus is the easy access to the Skytrain as the station is underneath the hotel building.",2019-08-08T22:50:15Z,308
287,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"4 stars for great location, cleanliness, value, and friendly staff. 

This Hyatt is located in the heart of downtown surrounded by shops and high end shopping. It's walking distance to the sea wall, Gastown, Chinatown, Granville, and restaurants. Perfect location for a Chicago tourist like me! It's reminiscent of the Mag Mile! There's a Starbucks in the lobby and Tim Hortons (24 hours) across the street. And for all your other drugstore needs, Shoopers is a block away!

The rooms are a good size, basic bathroom, clean, and the beds are cozy!!! Request any amenities you need such as slippers and shoe mits. 

Parking is rough stuff here. The metered parking is $5 per hour. The hotel offers a self parking with in and out privys for $40 per day! This hotel has an indoor pool and a small workout center. 

For the location and the value, I will definitely stay here again.",2019-03-26T14:05:18Z,308

When I asked why, I was told it was because people didn't check out until 4.  Not MY problem.  Additionally, there is loud drilling going on until 5 pm (renovation to outside of building) making it impossible to think, let alone take a nap.  No consideration for either problem.

289,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"I attended the 2018 North American Society for the Sociology of Sport Conference (NASSS) which was held at the Hyatt Regency Vancouver. The facility was great for the conference and great for conference attendees. The hotel is located in the city center near local transit. I took the train from YVR and the City Center stop is about two blocks away from the station.  There is lots of shopping in the area, but its high-end shopping (Coach, Burberry, etc.). The hotel has a small business center, but there is a Staples located next door to the property along with a 24 hour McDonald's and Tim Horton's as well as two Starbucks. I stayed in a room with two queen beds.  It was roomy, had the usual amenities as well as a mini fridge. The staff was extremely nice and went out of their way to answer any questions I had about the hotel and navigating the city.  

I also recommend the conference space. The rooms met all the needs of our conference and the 300 registered guests.  A special acknowledgment to the AV staff.  They were fantastic.  A great experience all the way around.",2018-11-05T22:19:57Z,308

The location is perfect and very easy walking distance to the cruise ship terminal or any areas of downtown. The hop on hop off bus has a stop right there. Beds are comfortable and the elevators were easy to use. Never had to wait even though there seemed to be a lot of guests the weekend we stayed.

There is a Starbucks in the lobby (great for your morning coffee), and also a Tim Horton and McDonald's (24 hours) next door!! There is a pool, which we can use in the cold weather too because its heated - so that looked fun!!! I enjoyed my stay, and I loved the area this hotel is in so I would highly pick it out again!!

292,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"I've stayed here around 5 times over the last couple years and it gets worse and worse every time. I would have they are around a 2-3 star hotel in regards to service.
We booked a room at the hotel online. When we arrived the person said that room wasn't available and they would put us in a cheaper room. I asked them how they were going to refund the money and they said no problem just have the website you booked with call us and we will take care of it.
The company we booked with called them... with me on the phone and they said ""no we will not be refunding anything"".
At the counter checking in we asked ""oh is the entire hotel full or how is that room not available"" and they responded ""no we have about 10 floors closed off because no one is staying here. Instead of upgrading us, they decided to downgrade us and then not return the money.
Its crazy that a hotel that is struggling so bad would want to lose the loyal customers that they once had.
The service throughout the stay was terrible, whenever we needed anything the phone took forever to get someone on it.
We left a really important item in the room and called after our stay. The person working said they would check the room and call us back. No one ever called.
This was the last time I will ever be staying at this hotel again.",2021-10-05T22:52:53Z,308

I appreciate your consistency, you always present yourself is clean, warm and you always keep me warm at night.  When I want to be left alone, you always read the sign, and I never fear any miscommunications. 

I always want to see you, and I'm thankful when I get a chance to spend time with you.  It's like meeting an old friend, no doubt how much I enjoy the time together.

Everything we wanted to see was an easy walk from here. Amazing shopping, the Christmas market, two areas with great night life, and a variety of incredible restaurants. The staff was also super helpful in directing us.

The room itself was perfect. The beds were SO cozy and we had a lovely view of the city. Everything was clean and the amenities were top notch. 

There was a great bar right in the hotel and the hotel itself is connected to a mall with all the basic stores. It really was the ideal location to explore the city! 

Check in and checkout were online and super easy. A frictionless booking and payment experience.

Looking forward to my next stay.",2018-12-10T23:19:03Z,308
297,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Probably the worse Hyatt I have stayed in...The property is good, with good central location. The rooms are nice. However, the management is pathetic. We stayed there for over a week, so we got a good idea. From check in, to parking, concierge, breakfast service...everything is effected by bad management...the service is certainly not upto north american standards and it seems this property is run by an offshore company...rude waiters, dirty dishes, no help with luggage at check in are just few of the issues...very bad experience...not gonna stay at hyatt again...their standard has certainly gone down...not recommended",2021-09-23T22:21:11Z,308
298,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Modern but not stark.  Great downtown location. Clean and comfortable but not warm and inviting. The shower water runs right across the entire bathroom floor making everyone's feet wet, which seems to me a simple problem to solve with a small barrier across the floor. Ingenious bathroom mirror décor with a raised circlular backlit mirror in the middle of the wall mirror. A lot of street noise reached my room on the 6th floor. I'd say 3.5 stars",2018-04-30T01:46:46Z,308

Pool (outdoor)and restaurant on site as well as Starbucks in the lobby, Tim Hortons next door and McDonald's 24hs for the late night snack after an all nighter..lol! There is shopping below the hotel (pharmacy, food court) but Robson Street and Pacific Center(Nordstrom's, The Bay, Michael Kors, Holt Renfrew, Harry Rosen,Hugo Boss) is walking distance. 
Chinese food is also in the mall below and a few other restaurants. 
Rooms are nice and clean and neat and views from the room are ok but have to peek thru buildings to see the harbour.",2018-09-29T11:52:23Z,308
300,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"I actually would have given a 1 or 2 star review-however the manager tried to remedy our issues, and I do appreciate that.

We reserved a 'suite'-that was supposed to have a king bed and two queens. But what we got was two rooms next to each other-one two full beds and in the other room a very old, run down 'living room' with a couch that had a pull out bed. And no blankets or pillows for that bed. So, either my kids slept on the small beds and we slept on the pullout couch or vice versa. The door didn't open easily between the two rooms, and the toilet easily clogged. Just NOT what we would expect from a Hyatt.

All the beds were hard as rocks. Just insanely hard. And-even though we were on a high floor-we still heard the traffic.

I called the manager in the morning, and she offered to send over pads for the beds. She also graciously comped our breakfast the next morning. We decided to try it one more night before we high tailed it out of there-and the gracious breakfast comp and padding helped enough to have us continue our stay another night.

I do have to say that the gym was excellent. The pool and Jacuzzi were nice as well. 

I did not like the surprise $35 per night parking fee-that is insane-especially when you can just park literally 100 feet away for $15. Had I known, I would have done that.

There is a very abundant and aggressive flux of homeless people all around the area. It did at times make me feel unsafe for my family, as many of them were either extremely high or extremely mentally unstable. For this reason more than any other-I don't think I would visit this area again",2017-07-04T03:28:22Z,308
301,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Good location and overall an OK stay but I didn't think the 4-star price tag is justified. A three star hotel at best. 

Our room was connected to another room (through a set of two doors on top of each other with locks) and when we got there the door on our side was open and the door on the other side was unlocked. Not knowing where the door went we accidentally walked into someone else's room, then ran out of there and locked the door on our side. Very weird. 

The mirror in the bathroom was dirty with some sticky spots and the room overall needed a deep clean. Will not be staying here again.",2021-10-03T21:11:06Z,308
302,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"I'm almost embarrassed to publish this review since its been sitting in my cue for like, forever it seems.  But I will just use my stand by excuse:   ""Better late than Never"".

sometimes, it is all about LOCATION.

Admittedly, the location of the Hyatt Regency is the main reason I booked a room for three nights during the family vacation this last August 2016.  The hotel is centrally located and is within walking distance of nearby shops, restaurants, and bars.  Robson Street with its many shops is only a blocks away, while Gastown is easily accessible via cab.

Our family took a cab from YVR, and it was about a 30 minute ride to the hotel.  Check-in was quick and efficient.  We initially stood in the regular check-in line, but were soon motioned to come over to the VIP/Rewards section since the staff there were not assisting anyone.  I wish I could remember the name of the female that helped us as she was friendly, polite, knowledgeable, and extremely competent at her job.  She had confirmed our reservation, and in no time at all we were on our way to our room.

ROOM Amenities:

balcony (views of Downtown Vancouver)
small fridge (very convenient)
flat screen tv
desk area
2 twin beds
charging stations near bed

HOTEL Amenities:

hotel restaurant (2nd floor)
bar on the first floor
small bar area on 2nd floor
starbucks in lobby area
fitness center

NOTE:  
1.  24 hour McDonalds in the building next door.

2.  Cabs readily available just outside hotel entrance.

Overall, we had a very pleasant stay at this hotel.  My brother, mom, and I all agreed that the best aspect was the location as many shops, restaurants, and bars were all within walking distance.  Our one complaint honestly were the pillows!!  They were just too soft to get a good nights sleep.  I think my brother didn't mind the soft pillows as much as my mom and I did.  Other than that, the room was sufficient and so were the hotel amenities.  

We did opt to have breakfast in the hotel restaurant once, and it was a decent experience.  The menu had the usual breakfast fare:  meats, eggs, toast, waffles, etc.  The starbucks lobby location was extremely convenient.  The lines were long in the morning, but the staff kept the line moving at a decent pace.  My brother and I did frequent the hotel bar a few times.  We wished there were more drink specials, but the location (yet again) was convenient and the bartenders were cool and friendly.

BOTTOM LINE:  A somewhat comfortable and satisfactory stay at the Hyatt Regency Vancouver.  The customer, hotel amenities, as well as its location are truly what makes this hotel worthwhile for its guests.",2017-04-23T20:58:18Z,308
303,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Overall, the hotel is pretty good. Location is great. The free shuttle that goes to the Capilano Suspension Bridge stops at this hotel so that was a plus. Not to mention it's connected to one of the trains underground. That underground area sn't always open though, so when we got there on a rainy Sunday afternoon, we couldn't go thru it.  Instead we had to walk in the rain outside. 
     Speaking of rain, this hotel is pretty stingy when it comes to lending out umbrellas. I've been in similar hotels around the world and whenever it rains, I've never been told that they may, or may not have one, or, this is the last one, and obviously it was raining in Vancouver for 2 days so we'd need one each for 2 days. Were they worried I wouldn't bring it back? I mean obviously I'd need to return back to the hotel dry, so I'd wanna return it. Anyway, that was weird to hear from ""guest services"".
     In terms of the rooms, we had a king bed on the 28th floor with a balcony. It had a nice view of the city of course. But it was interesting how they didn't have a little kitchenette outside. Instead they combined it with the bathroom? So you had ur tea/coffee maker next to the toilet, and the mini fridge inside The bathroom as well. Most of the toiletries had to be requested but at least it was available. The cleaning ladies were nice. There is a free BOGO yelp check in discount with the buffet breakfast at Mosaic so make sure to present that first when ur eating there cuz they didn't seem too familiar with it. Other than that, I do recommend this place. Very convenient esp if ur pressed for time.",2019-10-28T00:01:44Z,308
304,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"I'm a Hyatt Platinum member and used a night here before a cruise. Check in was easy since I did it from my phone. Was able to check in very early (as in 10AM) and check out late at 2PM. 

The service here was mediocre. Usually Hyatt workers go above and beyond especially when they know you are a member as well as in the travel industry. There was no extra treatment for me. I didn't even get that 2 for 1 breakfast coupon (food for thought, most Hyatts have given me a complimentary industry breakfast but this one doesn't).

Their toiletry selection wasn't as large as other Hyatt properties which is one of the fun parts of staying with Hyatt. The room though was comfortable though and clean. Phone did not appear to work. 

The elevator system was bizarre although some find it efficient. It's terrible when people start to check out because they take forever to get out of the elevator and unless you practically run into it, you will miss getting in and have to wait again (hard to explain their system without seeing it...). 

Location was perfect imo. There is a subway station right out front, you have a Tim Horton's next door along with a McDonald's (which messed up my order 2 out of 2 times). Less than a 10 minute walk to catch a cruise ship (not a difficult walk with luggage IMO). 

Never used the pool or gym. 

All in all this was a perfectly adequate hotel however for the price I would have expected more. That said, I would have no problems staying at the property again but would look for something similar that costs less.",2019-08-08T18:52:42Z,308
305,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Had a PD course here. Well not just PD course, I had many meeting and events here at the Hyatt Regency. Its one of the hot picked hotel for PD courses or just meeting. The reason being its located in the center of downtown. Its close to the Burrard skytrain. Well most people that come here, usually take transit. Parking is crazy and costly downtown. With no exception with the Hyatt.

Most conference meeting are located on the 34th floor and up. The conference room are good size and I believe it can be opened up into one large room.  One thing, I find interesting is their elevators. You press at the bottom or main floor to take you up to the floor you want to go to which is controlled by one central elevator screen for all elevators. To get down from the last floor you were on, you just return back in to the elevator at the end. There are no button to press.

As well, the hotel is clean and had lots of people working, so you don't ever have to worry about getting lost or anything.",2015-10-29T05:22:21Z,308
306,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Loved the renovation though I don't understand why 2 beds in a room need to be double. For me, it's a first with Hyatt. There seems to be sufficient room for 2 queens. 

Access to their club room costs $50 even if you're a member. Their reason is that it's small and can't accommodate many people. At the end of the day, you are surrounded by numerous restaurants, cafes and a market so this is not a feature you necessarily need.

If you check in through Yelp there is a BOGO coupon for a breakfast buffet with Mosaic. The Mosaic isn't what it used to be in terms of menu and atmosphere. It truly feels like a standard hotel in the dining space.

Staff were friendly and common spaces/amenities are clean. 

We probably won't return because there a many other beautiful hotels in the area at a lower price point. We'll save our points for their other properties.",2019-06-07T23:11:42Z,308
307,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"The worst Hyatt experience in recent memory; makes me angry enough to type up this review at 1am, for the lack of any better way of getting back at this establishment.

It used to be that you could rely on hotels to get a good night sleep, but it seems having felt pressure from competitive services, their response isn't to double down on quality, but to cut corners.

What the F has happened to beds at Hyatt!? The garbage inflatable mattress that we are sleeping on is caving in the middle like the Niagara Falls, bouncing like a water bed whenever one of us makes a move? Further, this new ""Hyatt queen"" size is a joke. The bed is so small, my legs are falling off the edge, and the only way two people can sleep is back-to-back, without ever moving a toe.

The last time I had such a shitty nights sleep was a $12 a night hostel, in college! Sad.

Ps. Photo attached. This is how they made my room this morning. Not F kidding you.",2017-03-28T07:14:53Z,308

However, I would have to say that the staff available did a fantastic job of making us feel at home. Housekeeping was not available during our stay but we were able to ask for needed items from the front desk and they would quickly run them up to our room. The host at breakfast remembered us each morning and was super friendly and welcoming. Overall it is a great hotel in a fantastic location. We hope to visit again in the future!",2019-10-21T17:03:11Z,308
310,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"RIP....   Sadly, I did give this place another chance but I was right.  No need to come back here again.  However, I want to be fair so here is my updated review.  

Good. 

Great location.  It is in the heart of downtown Vancouver and walking distance to many fun places and shopping malls.  Front desk people are good and friendly.  


Bad. 

Parking is not friendly and can be very expensive however it is downtown Vancouver.  Carpet can be a little dated and dirty but manageable.  Nose level can be a little challenging since the wall is not quite sound-proof.  I could hear someone coughing next door and it wasn't even a heavy and loud one.  


Ugly

We had a little issue with this hotel last time we visited so they invited us back with a voucher.  And we did ask for a firm bed and they said they would be ready for us.  And I did confirm with the staff about three times.  After confirming one more time at the front desk, we headed up to our room and the bed was even softer.  LOL...  Plus one of the beds was quite out of place and it looked like someone was still working on our room.  Nothing was ready for us at all....  The manager came up but I was hearing another typical empty promises...   



First of all, this hotel needs to buy some good quality mattresses.  The cheap ones are not going to cut it at 4 or 5 star hotels.  Don't tell me I didn't warn you... The bed is so soft and you will drawn in it.",2019-06-04T22:55:05Z,308
311,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"This is the perfect hotel to call ""home base"" while you tour everything Vancouver has to offer. This very modern, bustling hotel is tucked into the heart of downtown, next to just about everything; Four blocks from the pier/harbor/sea planes, two blocks from fabulous shopping, surrounded by restaurants, and just a few easy miles to North Vancouver, where you can truly experience Canadian natural wonders.

The service at this hotel is impeccable. Every little (and large) request was delivered to my room in under 3 minutes. Every - single - one. Incredible.

The concierge lounge always had tasty morsels available, day and night. One evening, they had bacon-wrapped scallops and I thought I was in heaven. It deserves one more mention: bacon-wrapped scallops. Mmmmmm.

The gym was well-stocked, clean, and the equipment was all new and functioning properly. The windows for the gym faced the pool and hot tub. I noticed a few people working out while observing their kids swimming... pretty genius adult/child play time setup!

The rooms were ultra clean and appeared to have brand-new everything! There were no ""dips"" in the mattresses, the carpet was fresh and new, the furniture smelled new, and there were outlets and charging areas on every wall! The bathroom was all stone, with a lighted large mirror, lighted makeup mirror, and a shower that rained from the ceiling.

I stayed on the 29th floor and it was ultra quiet. Perfect for catching much-needed Zzzzzzzzz.

The bellman, front desk, room service, concierge attendant, and kitchen were all fabulously helpful, and so personable! I loved my entire visit to Canada, but the Hyatt was the cherry on my sundae.

Hyatt is my hotel of choice for travel.",2014-11-05T01:02:32Z,308
312,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Assume that the poor reviews are a ""one-off"" because this is a top-notch property. First of all, it's a Hyatt. With a global reputation to maintain, you are not going to suffer from widespread ineptitude. Yes, every now and again, someone will do something that makes your stay unpleasant, but really, you can be sure that your overall visit to this location will be well worth your investment.

First, the rooms are wonderful, and in the first week of December, affordable. The king room was spacious with clean, comfortable bedding. I loved the rain shower head, makeup mirror, soft towels, and generous countertop.

The location is superb. With a Starbucks in the lobby, you can get your day started quickly with grab-and-go food.  I would skip the breakfast buffet at Mosaic on the 2nd floor. The prices are OUTRAGEOUS. We didn't ask before being seated, but when the bill came, it was more than even I would have imagined, and not really worth it for the variety or quality. (We drove to Granville Island Market and discovered that we could have eaten there for a third of the price!)

Cabs are easy to come by, and the valet staff will hail one for you. Be sure to take advantage of the overnight self-park behind the hotel. The valet service is very pleasant and easy to deal with (they even sent up items I needed from my vehicle straight to my room) but this is another overpriced amenity.

An ATM in the lobby with front desk staff who will break bills for you is a plus. And the elevators are SUPER EFFICIENT. Use the keypad to indicate the floor, and you will be directed to one of five elevators that will take you directly there. No waiting, no stopping ten times on the way up or down. That's the way to do it, Hyatt!

Bottom line: you can expect a world-class stay in a great location with shopping and nightlife within minutes by foot or taxi.",2018-12-03T16:47:14Z,308

The other hotel I stayed at in Vancouver was pet friendly in that it didn't require any of that, and the same for the hotel where I stayed in Whistler. Otherwise the room was nice, the staff was fine, and the location was great. They also only serve breakfast in the hotel restaurant for now (which doesnt make a ton of sense if restricting hours only for covid) and the hotel bar doesnt open til 3, (again, doesnt make total sense if only for covid). so all in all, i would say, ok.",2021-10-22T19:58:09Z,308

They did a great job!

I got my room for 130$ on Priceline. Check in was easy. I guess my Credit Card didn't go through ( due to my hotel tour the past month ) no problem, they just asked for 60$ cash deposit. 

The room was spotless. I really appreciated the renovations. My room was HUGE, and it had 2 beds, a very large desk, fridge, large bathroom. Nice fluffy towels. 

It was quiet, and staff was good. They granted Me a late check out the next day, however I had to leave on schedule due to a minor emergency with my GF. 

As I went to check out, they offered to hold my bags, I said yes please.

Now one thing that sucked was the pay Internet. But I knew that was coming off My deposit. But imagine my surprise when I was told I had also ""ordered breakfast "" 
Tell that to my rumbling tummy ! I asked if it was room service or in the restaurant. 
He said the restaurant, I asked to speak to the manager, as there was no way I was in there ordering food, as a matter of fact, I didn't even know where it was. He refunded me the money, but I was a bit put off, as I didn't want anyone to think I was trying to scam a meal. 

I came back later to get my bags, tipped and left. Yes I would return ( for that rate )

318,Hyatt Regency Vancouver,3.9,"Just returned from a three night stay at The Hyatt Regency in Vancouver. This hotel is perfectly located and surrounded by lots of shopping and dining. This property is very modern and technologically advanced (cool elevator system) and there is complimentary wi-fi. There is a Starbucks in the lobby and Tim Hortons, 24 Hour McDonalds and a drug store next door. There's also a bar / lounge and restaurant in house...

Each encounter with a Hyatt employee was very pleasant. It all started when we checked in. Sigfred assisted us and was very helpful with suggestions during our stay in Vancouver and our day trip to board in Whistler. He definitely answered all of our questions and took care of our requests. Our room was awesome -- we had a corner room with a balcony. The room itself was very spacious and inviting (room 2001). Our view of downtown was amazing (see pictures). Don't forget to adjust the shower head settings to your liking (I love strong water pressure)

Shopping is literally within steps from the Hyatt. We rented a car because we went to Whistler (70 something miles away -- takes a little less than two hours -- the drive is so beautiful and scenic), but it's probably not needed if you intend to stay within the general downtown area. Vancouver also has public transportation that you can easily take advantage of 

Note : 

Be mindful of your schedule if you have a car so you know which parking option to choose. The parking structure has different rates, so ask for a printout when you check in. The overnight parking at The Hyatt is $36, but it allows unlimited in and out privileges until 2 PM the following day. We only selected this option on our second night since we had plans to leave the hotel on two separate occasions. On our last night, we returned to The Hyatt around 8 PM and left before 6 AM -- we selected the standard parking garage rate and it was only $4 (weekend nightly rate if leaving before 6 AM).

We love Vancouver and try to vacation here as we come from California which is so different. We are here again this year staying in the Hyatt with our family but unfortunately service is going down the drain. We booked total of 4 rooms and we are so disappointed with how staff at the lobby treat us. No place to sit around the lobby, no room service, bad staff treatment. Finally we decided to stay in one of the four rooms to celebrate Christmas. We found this staff guy opening our door and entered our room while banging at the door in such a rude way that we got scared. He kept on saying we were loud and yelling at us. The least he would have done is knock politely or gave us a phone call to warn us. This staff member treated us as if he was coming to arrest us while we were just playing white elephant with our kids and family. No one was drunk and nothing was inappropriate. So dissatisfied and disappointed.

Parking here is horrendous - either pay through the nose at the meters, or through the nose at in the ridiculously-priced underground.  The good news is that the hotel is close to 2 SkyTrain lines.

As I was here for a conference, I got to hang out on the 34th floor.  The view here is pretty decent, though the tower has obviously been dwarfed by the newer adjacent buildings.  But you can still see much of Stanley Park, as well as the rooftops of lesser buildings.

The catered appies are top notch - I got to try such goodies as smoked duck, cheese, and cherry tomatoes.  Very fresh ingredients.

The only complaint I had of the refreshments at this event is that they kept running out of iced beverages.  As the room filled up, it got quite a bit warmer in there, and everyone started drinking more.  Not sure if they're only supposed to refill the beverage tanks after a preset amount of time, but there were a couple of times when everyone had to walk around thirsty.

There is a lovely little park/garden across the street that had cherry blossoms blooming so that was an immediate treat to see out my 13th floor window.  

The hotel had friendly staff.  Upon my arrival, I had used my app check-in/digital key option but decided to stop by the front desk.  They have a pretty well stocked sundries shop right there as well.  I was a bit disappointed to not be provided with any of my usual Gold level benefits (breakfast); which I later learned was continental -- but I was not even told about that?  Overall the security of the building is pretty solid as you need a key to get up to the rooms, along with into the building during off hours.

My room was incredibly comfortable.  A work colleague shared the hotel went through a big renovation at some point in the recent past.  I was in a corner room on the 13th floor.  The housekeeping was actually the best part of my trip.  They took great care of me each day, replenishing everything.  The rooms are also quite quiet blocking out any noise.

My only issue during my stay was the lack of working ice machines. I hit up about three floors before I could find a working ice machine. The hotel restaurant's kitchen seems to be open pretty late (10-ish).",2023-01-31T19:40:25Z,108
325,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"This Hilton sits on top of the Crystal Mall (Chinese vendors) and across the street from a large Western mall, outdoor mall, several restaurants. There is a nice coffee shop across the street. 

Convenient to drive to most places. 

The streets around here is easy to drive around. The nearby shops and restaurants within walking distance looks new. Safe neighborhood. 

Bank and money exchange are within walking distance. 

Hotel provides parking in the underground parking garage. Although I find this parking garage design is quite tight. 

Dog friendly.

The Asian man with the large frame eye glasses was super kind and helpful!

326,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"We stayed at the Hilton Metrotown for nights 2 and 3 of a four night vacation to Vancouver. 

The first night was at a different Hilton property in Washington.  That stay at the Washington property was a nightmare (mostly from a billing perspective).  When we arrived in Metrotown, the issue at the Washington property was still unresolved.

As a kind gesture, upon hearing of our troubles the previous night, Hilton Metrotown upgraded us from a standard king to a king suite.  They certainly didn't have to do this, but it was greatly appreciated.

The hotel was spotless, room was equally spotless and comfortable.  Shower pressure was great.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  

The hotel restaurant was great, and the bartender went out of his way to make sure that we were taken care of.

We had two dogs with us.  The pet fee and policy was very reasonable.  Parking was fine, considering that it is in an urban an area.  Valet parking is an option, but we didn't use it.

Late on the second night of our stay, the toilet in our room decided to stop working.  The night staff did their best to try and fix it, but they couldn't, and we ended up having to change rooms at 1:30 AM.  Certainly an unfortunate situation, but we file it under ""stuff happens.""  We appreciate the efforts of the night crew, and they quickly got us situated into a different room.

Despite the one hiccup, we are very pleased with our stay here.  The location was perfect for what we needed, and the service was good - even under less than ideal circumstances.",2023-06-25T18:27:34Z,108

Wonderful central spot for your l loving needs.",2022-09-01T22:09:47Z,108
329,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Decided to stay here because it was close to Crystal Mall and Metrotown.  The hotel and Crystal Mall is actually connected but I didn't find much to do at the mall.  Metrotown is only a few minutes of walk.
The room was comfortable and spacious.  I have reserved the business lounge level only to find out that my room and the lounge is on a separate floor, making it inconvenient.  In the lounge, other than free soda and coffee and a microwave, there were nothing.  Compare to Westin and Sheraton, this is on a much cheaper scale in terms of offering.
The breakfast buffet was complementary because of my room type.  It was a decent breakfast with about 5 hot items, fresh fruits bar, cold meats and oatmeals.  There are servers at the tables.  Since the hotel is so close to many eateries, if the breakfast wasn't complimentary, I probably would dine out instead.  Tim Hortons is only a min away.
Their parking shares with Crystal Mall's, old and small.",2022-12-31T23:23:09Z,108
330,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Booked a stay with Points. Booked their executive suite level. It included access to their Lounge on the top floor. Their lounge was less than anything special. Had a few chairs and a decent view. The amenities was much less than executive. 
When arrived the check in process was pretty simple. When I arrived at my room, it didn't feel like I got an executive suite. It looked all the other rooms in the hotel photos online. After settling into the room, we noticed the ""plush"" bathrobes were nothing more than terry cloth material. And the shower a very high pitched noise coming from it. After a night on the town we went to the pool area. No water/pool lights were on, the water was warmer than out side but by no means it was not ""heated."" The hot tub was disgusting. It looked like hard/poop water and smelled like sulfur. It also did not have any water lighting and when in it you couldn't see your feet at the bottom. Got out immediately. After being in the pool till almost closing at 11p, we went back to the room to sleep and noticed that the beds weren't completely made with fitted sheets. It was like they were just tossed on the bed. Also found a pillow with nasty stains on the pillow case. But it had a second pillow on top as to hide it from view. The ice machine on the floor didn't work and the front desk suggested I visit the ice machine on the floor above or below us to find ice.  All and all I would say one of the worst Hiltons I have stayed at. Been a Diamond member for over 2 years and I would not recommend this hotel. The ""valet parking"" option was ok except it wasn't secluded from the general public and was shared with the mall parking and was explained that our car could be broken into. Photos included are of the beds, hot tub, and pillow.  The only thing they offered as a refund was my parking and pet fee. Nothing to do with my actual stay.",2023-03-21T02:13:12Z,108
331,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"I've been here twice for Xmas party last month and Dec 2018. My sister invited me for a Mazda Xmas party and it was the most memorable party ever!

Buffet menu was pretty awesome. It had Sushi, salad roast beef, smoked salmon and some pasta as well (Tortellini and pasta salad). Dessert selection was also decent. Chocolate Fondue was yummy. Sushi was quite average imho. Roast Beef was pretty good. 

Drink selection was good as well. It had alcohol, pop and some juices. Some tables were empty though. I was MORE than full that my tummy could explode soon. Great venue! Interior and washrooms were clean. I enjoyed playing gambling here and will look forward to Xmas party 2020 one day! I've never had a perfect xmas party like this.",2020-01-30T04:33:47Z,108

334,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Often you do not run into exceptional service; however, our one night stay was more than that.  After checking in we went to the room, unpacked and of course tried to connected to the Wi-Fi (we have a 14 year old).  No luck.  A quick call to the front desk and Chris Perna, hotel manger, was knocking at the door.  He got on the phone with the Internet provider and ...well... if you've ever been on the phone with an Internet provider you know it didn't go well.  Finally they told him that the wireless was down (no kidding). We weren't really upset because wi-fi is always unpredictable, but we were more than impressed that he actually tried and succeeded to resolve the issue.  99 out of of 100 people would have said sorry, you're outa luck.  Nope he went and got a wireless router, connected it in the room via hard wire, got us connected to the wi-if, and we are off and running.  Speed was FAST too.

So all is perfect and we're more than happy.  Today we got an email from Chris Perna and he requested that we get 20,000 points for our inconvenience.  That's a one night stay!!!  He further explained in detail why our floor wasn't getting wi-fi and apologized.  Wow.

Exceptional service, attention to detail, and someone who cares about his customers.  Chris Perna is truly exceptional at his job.  Kudos to you!  We will be back.

Thanks for a great stay at your hotel and wish you and your staff a happy Canada Day.",2016-07-07T04:28:13Z,108
335,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,Hideous rooms. The most unprofessional customer service I have ever seen. Nobody speaks English and nobody knows anything. A joke! And ugly decor. Bad food.,2017-04-09T05:33:02Z,108
336,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"First off, despite the name this hotel it actually is in Burnaby (as can be seen by the address), which is east of Vancouver.  Due to the small (but densely populated) footprint of the city of Vancouver, Vancouver is not actually too far and can be reached by car in 15-20 minutes depending on traffic.  So location is not bad if you're staying in order to visit Vancouver, though it's not that great either.

I'm a little confused as to the Hilton brand image.  They market themselves as a four star hotel but honestly I've stayed at two star hotels which were just as ""nice"" if not nicer.  On the other hand, their room prices are also in line with a two star hotel.  Booked a room with king bed for 2 for about $120/night in June, which is not bad at all for the area.

However, once they start nickel-and-diming you for every convenience, it's not such a bargain.  Bringing a pet?  $49 flat fee.  Want to use wifi in your room?  $8 per night PER DEVICE (!!!).  Parking?  $9 in a nightmarish underground gulag shared with the mall across the street; expect to spend 15 minutes getting in and out during the day.  Microwave?  Extra.  Refrigerator?  Extra.  Breakfast?  Extra.  The list goes on.

The room itself was clean and fairly spacious, but certainly not luxurious.  I tried to call down to the front desk a couple times but couldn't get through -- it was a weekend and apparently their staff was overwhelmed.

Overall I guess they're OK, but I doubt I'll stay there again.",2013-06-12T22:04:29Z,108
337,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Stayed here for several days for business.  Arrived on Halloween and we were greeted by candy, pumpkins and a welcoming staff.  Accommodating a group of 10, in five separate rooms was handled quickly and our rooms very comfortable.  Dianne on the 18th floor was WONDERFUL!  Valet staff was quick and made room for our cargo van in their shipping bay.  The lounge staff made delicious drinks that completed our 12 hour work days,  One bartender ( i wish i had his name! ) learned to make a Grape Nehi which made my coworker ecstatic!  Sadly they could not accommodate our stay longer when we realized we needed extra days. to complete our job. 

 No complaints, will stay here again!

OH!  The wings in the lounge are the bomb!  Ate them almost every night!  Skip the fry bread, too thick.  Nachos are good, salads are just so so.",2013-11-13T12:30:54Z,108

I have a very short walk, less than two blocks, to the Metrotowers (or the mall or the Skytrain, if you're looking for those) and not only is that walk partially covered, it goes right by a Starbucks. The dining room upstairs is really good and I've had a few delicious meals there (the prawn chile pasta is my favorite, but I also had a stellar three-course Dining Out type dinner promotion with lobster tail, seared ahi and an amazing octopus tartare/seaweed salad plus salted caramel cheesecake AND a mini chocolate macaron for $40CDN!) as well as great breakfasts - yogurt, fruit and granola or steelcut oatmeal to go and an omelet delivered to my room once before work (great options for the omelet including brie and arugula). Also, they have a great selection of local beers and wines upstairs! I like the Peter Thomas Roth bath products and the basket of green apples in the lobby. Very comfy bed, fluffy pillows, soft linens and an easy to adjust thermostat. Quick check-in process and no check-out needed which is my favorite. Free wifi can be spotty.",2016-02-11T18:39:42Z,108

The drinks at the hotel bar are all decently priced and the food is delicious!  (Especially the fries that come with the burgers/sandwiches)  Parking can be difficult because it is shared with Crystal Mall and some of the spots are small, but you can always park in the Hilton and residential parking lot (as long as you're not staying overnight).  The Opal Lounge at the Hilton is also very relaxing, there you can get complimentary water/soda, snacks, and they offer a quick continental breakfast (the eggs were fluffy and the potatoes were soo good) and pastries on the side.

344,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"While the hotel is clean and comfortable, we had a very disappointing experience as a new hotel policy left a bad taste . My elderly mother travelled to visit me and after a long flight, we arrived early at the hotel. We were told the room was ready but would need to pay an additional $30 to gain access. Being Hilton Honors member didn't help.
When told she was tired and needed to lie down the associate, never gazing up from the screen to address us as customers said that's the policy no exceptions. We will no longer refer our visitors here as we have done so multiple times over the years.
This policy is an unreasonable cash grab and a deterrent for my future visiting friends and family.
Google review amounted to a mere apology but no indication that this policy would be changed.
Buyer beware if you count on arriving early.
Not for me though, lots of other options on the area (ex. Element by Westin).",2023-04-24T18:51:15Z,108
345,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"This hotel is rated a 4 star. I say it's more like a 3.5-3.75.
It's clean and quiet, sure. But it's lacking in the class and style of a 4 star. I did like the fact it was so close to Metrotown, and the skytrain. 

The lobby, hallways & rooms are nothing special. The decor is lacking. The colours are boring. There is nothing stand out here at all. You need a key for the elevator and to enter the hotel later at night.

Mostly the service is ok . Nothing bad, nothing exceptional- that is except for the guy who works the front desk at night-  he is cool. And one of the bellmen who got me candy. 

The view I had over looked a construction site beside Metrotown. The most exciting thing about it was the crane. 

Currently the pool & hottub are out of service. However, They did offer a complimentary pass to a local Rec center or say we could use the Holiday Inn pool. 

Wifi is not free unless you book directly through them or are part of the loyalty program ( Hilton Honours ). So expect to pay 6.99 and up per day. 

If your on the executive floors, then you can get free continental breakfast in the morning, and evening appetizers ( 5-9 pm ) in the 18th floor lounge. They also have an honour bar in there as well. 

Daily in the lobby, they have 2 pitchers of water infused with fruit as well as some smartie like candy. This was a nice touch. 

I probably wouldn't of chosen this particular hotel, but it was an express deal on Priceline. It is a good choice for the business traveler or if your looking for a quiet place to rest before your big shopping trip !",2018-07-15T09:54:09Z,108
346,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"A solid hotel in a great location.

I stayed here for 3 nights and the hotel was great. Close to a plethora of restaurants, shopping malls, and the rail just several blocks away.  

Overall the hotel was great. The lounge for members on the 18th floor had an array of drinks and bites throughout the day. I never did check out the breakfast included on the 3rd floor, but apparently offerings are better than in the lounge.  

The room was modern, the hotel upgraded us with a separate living room. All the furnishings felt new and there was plenty of space. I'd definitely consider staying here again for the price and convenience.",2019-12-05T00:28:59Z,108

When in Canada we always have to visit Tim Horton's, which is a quick walk from the hotel. The Starbucks near that had a lot of different cold and hot sandwiches that I had never seen in the U.S. 
The hotel is very clean and modern. Front desk staff is friendly and helpful. My family had an issue with a room that smelled like cigarette smoke. They were able to switch the room. That's pretty much my only complaint about the area--lots and lots of smokers everywhere. The double queen beds worked fine for us. Parking and breakfast are not included.",2019-07-28T03:38:25Z,108
348,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"This Hilton is located in Metrotown, far from the downtown area but close to a large shopping center. The sky train stops in the area, offering a convenient option for airport transfers and trips down to the waterfront.

We arrived around midday and check-in was quick and easy and throughout our stay, the elevators were readily available. The hotel certainly has a little age but it is kept up relatively well. We stayed in a two-room suite that had a great view of the city. The only issue with the room was that water did not drain well from the shower.

Attached to the hotel is a mall and nearby are multiple grocery stores and restaurants, many that offer Asian cuisine. Late night dining in the area is limited. We dined twice - late dinner and breakfast - at the hotel's restaurant ""Reflect Social Dining + Lounge"" and we ordered one of the hotel's pizzas when we arrived. I was very surprised by the reasonably priced pizza, which had excellent crust and came with four sodas. The food in he restaurant was all average.

This hotel is located away from Vancouver however, short sky train ride away, (about 20 minutes). Hotels at downtown Vancouver is very expensive, this one is a short train ride away is more affordable.

They are also located adjunct to the Crystal Mall featuring all kinds of Asian stuff, I enjoyed going over there to look around.

Service here is always excellent. They just make you feel so welcome, front desk staff, executive lounge and restaurant staff. They were so good, I had to send compliment to their corporate office while I was still there. I normally wait to send feedback after I check out but I couldn't wait to share their great service.

354,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights, I paid for the hotel myself and received a discounted group rate as part of a convention.

The hotel did not have the air conditioning on in the rooms.  I understand it is cool out, but inside a closed room, the outside temperature has not impact.  All I could do was run the fan on high to move the air around.  The air was very cold in the hallways, so it was definitely on in the common areas but not the rooms.  I even changed rooms the first night because maintenance came to the room to check the a/c and he said it was blowing out cool air and disabled the sensor so that it would run continuously.  The room never cooled down, so I moved to a new room at 4 am.  In both rooms I set the temp to 60F and it never got lower than 72.

The bathrooms have enough counter space.

The shower has a tub that is a soaking tub.  You have to climb into it to take a shower.  They use water softener that makes the tub so slippery that I am surprised no one has been injured.  I used a bath towel on the floor of the tub to keep from slipping. They need to provide rubber mats for the tubs.

Executive Lounge/Opal Lounge was good and I felt worth the cost per day.  Staff there was very attentive and pleasant.

Housekeeping was very good, my room was cleaned well every day.

The restaurant is okay.  I ate there twice for lunch and it was just okay.  I was in a hurry both times so I didn't have time to go out of the hotel to eat.  I am insulted that the second time I ate lunch it was an ordeal to sit at the bar to order lunch from the menu.  I had to wait for the hostess to come by to seat me, then she told me to just sit there, then the bar staff yelled at me that I couldn't sit there, that they didn't have a menu, then they insulted me by asking the people who were sitting next to me at the bar if I paid for my meal.   They said to the two people that I left without paying for my meal. We were on a tour together later that day and they informed me that the bartended said I didn't pay.  I had filled out my bill to charge it to my room.  When I returned from the tour, I checked with the front desk to confirm the charge was on my bill and it was.  Your staff was rude to me and then rude to suggest I didn't pay my bill to another customer.

355,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Stayed here last weekend as a Hilton Diamond member because I wanted to experience the executive lounge.  As a diamond member, I got the free breakfast, executive lounge access (Opal lounge) and premium wifi.  Parking is $12 CAD.  Got it through the Hilton Honors app for $105 CAD (140 CAD after taxes and fees), got only an upgrade to the mountain view suite, but no executive floor room because of a firefighter ball that was happening that Saturday so no executive floor rooms were available for me to upgrade to (Floors 16-18).

4 stars when compared to other North American Hilton properties, this is a great hotel, however, when compared to its international properties, it falls quite short (3 stars).

Room itself was small with outdated furniture.  It came with a tv in the living room and bedroom but it was less than 40"".  Get a room with an odd number to get the mountain view.  Service was great especially in telling us where the jacuzzi was located and providing requested complimentary products such as toothbrush with traveler sized Crest toothpaste, Secret deodorant and comb.  We got no turn down service even thought I had requested it via Hilton app and in person.  Bed was comfortable and bathroom came with Peter Thomas Roth products.  USB charger is available in the rooms especially with both the desk lamps.

Jacuzzi did work this weekend, however, after dipping my hand in the pool, I noticed the water was just warm and not hot tub quality.  It was the roughly the same temp as the heated pools. There's no switch for jets so I opted to not go swimming.  All the pools and jacuzzi are outdoors btw.

BREAKFAST
Opt for the breakfast in the Reflect restaurant.  It offers a decent continental breakfast selection with cut fruit (watermelon, melon, pineapple), as well as hard boiled eggs and powdered scrambled eggs, four different types of cold cuts, croissant especially chocolate croissant, custard danish, plain yogurt and bread for toasting.  As for heated dishes, they had chicken sausage, bacon, oatmeal, powdered scrambled eggs and pancakes with syrup.  The wait staff come around with coffee and pitchers of freshly squeezed orange juice.  They also have an impressive array of Tazo teas to choose from... more than 15 types.  I got the blue colored one.  Four cereals are available:  raisin bran, corn flakes, rice krispies and one other I forgot.

Opal lounge breakfast
Smaller selection.  Instead of the cut fruit separated into different platters, it is mixed into a fruit bowl.  There's four types of cereal available here, but one of the types is Fruit Loops.  You can also get herb garlic cream cheese, however, there's no bagels available.  Chicken sausage, powdered scrambled eggs, bacon and oatmeal are available as well.  The espresso machine is available as self serve.  Only 9 types of Tazo tea available compared to over 15 types in the restaurant.

Opal lounge
Smallest lounge I have been in, but great views of the mountains.  It looked as big as my suite. 
Espresso machine is available during lounge hours of 630-10 AM and 630 PM to 10 PM.  They do offer paper cups to make bringing your free coffee drinks around easier.  Evening reception is from 630 PM to 830 PM, however alcohol is not free.  They had two types of cheese:  pepper jack and another white cheese with crackers.  They also had strawberry cheesecake, apples, and bacon quiche hor'd ouvre.  

Premium wifi

The meeting room foyer is quite spacious, but can get quite packed before the conference rooms are opened.  This could be intentional though, as it forces one to mingle.

The mobile bars are set up at the end, and the staff were great at keeping the lineups at a minimum.  The wait staff are friendly and cordial.

358,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"The jacuzzi is always shut down when I stay here and nobody bothers to tell us upon check in. We always end up learning the hard way in our bathing suits making the long trek to the outdoor jacuzzi, which is on the 3rd floor, but only accessible through the gym on the 2nd floor (confusing!) 

Most hotels let their guests know upon check-in when an amenity is out of service. We spoke with two employees of the hotel to ask which floor the the jacuzzi/pool were on, and neither of them was informed of the jacuzzi closure either. It would be a good idea if staff are informed of updates like this in their team meetings each morning to be of the best service to any guests they encounter.

Other than that this hotel is very nice. The bed was comfortable and the breakfast was excellent in the restaurant downstairs.",2017-03-02T23:38:42Z,108
359,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Located in the Metrotown Mall in Burnaby BC.  The nearby Skytrain makes it easy to travel to Vancouver attractions.

Clean, comfortably furnished rooms.

Self park is easy enough.

BC's largest mall is just across the street.

Breakfast on the 3rd floor is actually decent.

Good option when visiting Vancouver BC.  The room prices are much less what you have to pay for in central Vancouver BC.",2019-04-08T21:09:22Z,108
360,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"This hotel is fairly clean. No problems during the stay there. Husband was complaining how there's no black out curtains and a large gap on the bottom of the entry door allowing light to come in at night.

Other than that this is in the center of Burnaby, a developing city next to Vancouver. About half hour drive to Richmond night market.",2016-05-16T23:36:08Z,108
361,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Came into town for a 2 night stay after having stayed at a Hilton in Washington. We had such a great experience in Washington and were expecting the same here at Metrotown....but that did not happen. 

Upon checking in, we walked up to the service counter and despite there being two employees, none greeted us. After informing them we were checking in, they merely had us sign the agreement and handed us our room keys. We had to inquire about a map, brochure, and the parking lot. Only then were we merely provided with a map and pointed towards the parking lot. There was also no mention of a parking fee. 

The room was dated and not clean. There were hairs in the sink, water in the tub, and the shower faucet was broken. 

The uncleanliness was also evidenced on the bed, as one of the pillows was stained with possibly blood(?) 

We made coffee in room one morning and were surprised to find the creamer was dried out/expired. There was only one lid and one sleeve despite there being two cups.

The surrounding area does not have much to offer. Being in the center of China town(?), nearly all shops and restaurants are Chinese. The hotel itself is attached to the Crystal Mall, which causes a lot of foot traffic, as well as vehicular in the parking structure. Additionally, given that the hotel is connected to the mall and restaurants, there is a odor of food and shops as soon as you walk in. 

Overall, we were unsatisfied with the stay. We had high hopes given other reviews, but were disappointed. We would have much rather spent more money at a different location. 

Travelers beware.",2017-11-14T05:40:59Z,108
362,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"I am a fan....affordable place to live with only CAD $75/night, down the lobby is a Crystal mall food court, which is an Asian style food court..the food court isn't cheap. IN fact, we only ate here for convenience cause the taste and prices aren't great.

Concierge are very friendly, staff are nice. the only complaint is they put us in a room with bad view- facing constructions so ugly views.",2017-04-11T03:21:37Z,108
363,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Beautiful lobby, lovely rooms, and yes - access to the club level is definitely worth it! I was here to keynote at a Librarian Conference, not as a tourist, so having a comfortable base of operations was key! This Hilton was very comfortable. 

LIVING THE CLUB LIFE: 
If you're not a Diamond club member, or paid for an Executive Level room, always ask about a possible upgrade. Sometimes you can get a complimentary upgrade and sometimes you're charged extra. This time, I was charged an extra $25 a night to have access to the club lounge. And it was well worth it! A nice happy hour with hot  hors d'oeuvres and a great breakfast with eggs, potatoes, and bacon. Frankly, one night I took a pass on dinner and just had the hot snacks. 

The executive lounge is on he 18th floor, it's well stocked with good selection of food and drinks (bottles of chilled water and the Latte maker alone make it worthwhile!) and it has great views of the mountains.

I had a lovely suite with a separate living room and a bedroom with a comfy king bed with a stunning view of the mountains and the Vancouver skyline. 

GREAT ROOM FEATURES: 
I really liked that they had a USB plug bedside. We need those!  I also liked that they had a blue recycle bin in the room, a clear front refrigerator (for those bottles of water nabbed in the lounge) and a comfy work desk & chair. 

TRAVEL & HOTEL TIPS: 
If you're traveling to a hotel and you're on Twitter, check to see if they have a Twitter account and Tweet them that you're excited about your arrival! Sometimes you get a sweet surprise! (see picture) Being nice never hurts. 

For FREE Wi-Fi: Join the FREE Hilton Honors Program online before traveling. It's worth it!",2016-11-19T18:03:36Z,108

365,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"I've been in Seattle all week and my boyfriend and I decided to plan an impromptu overnight birthday trip to Vancouver.  We knew very little about the city, where to stay etc., so this hotel was booked solely on the fact that it's a Hilton, we have Honors Points and the B&B's we looked at didn't allow any less than a two night stay.  

The Cons:  it's located in Metrotown which  is located about 10 miles away from the Seawall and Stanley Park

Pros:  The service.  Immediately upon arrival, we were welcomed and kindly upgraded to a suite on the executive level.  The staff took the time to show us around, give us tourist tips, maps of the rail, etc.  The upgrade provided us with hor d'oeuvres and cocktails in the evening and breakfast in the morning.  We filled up so much on the delicious evening treats that we didn't have room for dinner! The front desk also sent up a birthday cake and a card for us.  Very sweet gestures did not go unnoticed.

Comfort: the bed was comfortable, the room was quiet, the shower was fully stocked with Peter Thomas Roth products (a fav of mine) and plenty of towels were enough to make me feel at home. 

The location: although I said it was a con, you are near a big shopping center, a movie theater and Asian restaurants galore! The sky rail is also right around the corner so getting to and from places was easy peasy!

Overall, I was impressed and would return in a heartbeat!",2015-07-09T23:21:53Z,108
366,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"The hotel is located in the center of Burnaby, about 15 minutes to downtown Vancouver and less than 35 minutes to major attractions. There are plenty of shops and local restaurants in the area in case you don't fell like driving out. In actuality, the hotel is connected to The Crystal Mall, where you can explore Chinese food and shops. Boba (bubble) tea, beef noodle soup, sushi, and fresh vegetables and fruits can be found throughout the mall. It reminds me of a farmers market / shopping mall. 
The parking is a bit challenging because of this however. The cars back up because there are so many people in and out of the area. Another downside is that you get the odor of Chinese food at times in the lobby.
The pool is small, really a lap pool, and the jacuzzi is available but only until 10p for kids.
The rooms are clean and quiet. There's some construction happening across the street but for the most part it's quiet. 
Nevertheless I would definitely stay here again.",2017-06-07T21:42:00Z,108
367,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"The Christmas Day buffet gone wrong!

Even with a 1pm reservation, we waited over half hour to be seated.  Food choices were poor for the price they charged.  With seafood usually being the most popular items in any buffet, and knowing fully the high number of resos, they were extremely unprepared.  After asking a few times, one of the chiefs brought out 6 raw oysters for the 4 of us but only to see live worms jumping around after we all had eaten 1 each.  

The manager offered us free liquor to ""cleanse"" our stomach which we denied.  Then he offered to take 1 adult and 1 children off our bill ($100) which we accepted humbly.  What can you do really, right???  The staff told us it is totally normal when serving raw foods.  

It is our first and last time going there!",2017-12-27T19:39:20Z,108
368,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"First time in Vancouver  and decided to stay at this hilton. Definitely  a decent hotel and location very close to the skytrain and attached to a asian mall and food court and next to an even bigger mall.
 Staff was extremely helpful room, had a horrible view from room, but I wasn't in it much anyways so wasn't a huge deal. Tried the continental breakfast buffet and I must say I've never had better egg ham Benedict fresh from the kitchen. Worth the 21 Cad  imo.",2016-04-14T21:35:58Z,108
369,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Easy and friendly check in.

Rooms clean and plenty of space. Ample pillows. 

Close to lots of shopping and food.

Restaurant was expensive but good food.

Parking was expensive. A bit of a nightmare to navigate. Lots of mall traffic. We had to park in P2. P1 was for valet and was basically empty. I never saw a valet.

Some minor age issues. Elevators felt worn out. Flooring cracking.

Would stay again.",2018-01-28T20:16:25Z,108
370,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,Another good Hilton property. As diamond with these people I got a crazy upgrade for my one night which is a waste but whatever. You are surrounded by places to eat but mostly are Asian. Its connected to the Crystal Mall which is 100% Chinese stuff that I could see. Nice views from my window. They had a very nice executive lounge that served basically full hot breakfast as complimentary.,2017-10-03T16:36:13Z,108
371,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"I chose this Hilton for the primary reason that it is 50% cheaper than Hilton downtown.  However, I found that it did not take very long to drive back even during peak hour, contrary to some review.  It took me half an hour during peak hour from Stanley Park.  So location is not an issue for me, with a rental car. 

Upgraded to a suite as a Hilton gold member, was told the Executive Floor was full.  The last room was given to the guy before me.  Tough luck.  The suite is very spacious, like a little apartment (very little by North America standard).  Gold members gets free bottle of water.   Complimentary breakfast.  Breakfast was so so, but adequate, nothing like the Hilton breakfast in Dupont Circle in Washington DC.  Also wifi is complimentary for gold member. 

Burnaby has a large ethnic community (or all over Vancouver), there are plenty of Vietnamese, Chinese and all kinds of restaurant to visit.  

Service is courteous.  The gym was ok too, but the boso ball was flat, it looks like no one has pumped it for a while.  I notified the front desk, and hope it is done.  

There is a garage attached to the hotel as well, parking fee is very reasonable, I think self parking is only $11 per night.

Would not hesitate to stay there again.",2014-06-20T18:40:07Z,108
372,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Stayed at Hilton Vancouver Metrotown last weekend. Although it is outside Vancouver, it is not all that far. Just a short 15 minute SkyTrain ride which is 2 blocks from the hotel gets you into downtown. Due to the high frequency of trains, the wait to get on is never too long.

The Hilton is right across from Metrotown and the hotel has an Asian mall called Crystal Mall downstairs. The mall has an assortment of shops, but its main draw is the food court. And which I could swear that I could smell a faint smell of Chinese food wafting from the hotel air vents several floors up.

I found the Hilton through Priceline and paid about $94 for one night. The Vancouver area is generally expensive for lodging, so this seemed to be a fair rate for a 3.5 star hotel.

And if there was any doubt about staying at the hotel, the room justified staying here. The room had a large bed with an assortment of different pillows. A relaxing chair sits to the side of the bed. There was also a marble desk in the room. Free room wired internet is currently provided, but no free room wi-fi is offered. Make sure to bring a travel router, otherwise head downstairs to utilize the wi-fi available in the hotel lobby. The hotel is currently working on offering free wi-fi throughout the hotel in the future.

In addition, the room has Lavazza Italian coffee and Peter Thomas Roth bath toiletries. Unlike my last two stays in which toiletries were basic, the toiletry selection here stood out. Two soaps, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, body wash and a shower cap.

Room itself was comfortable. I was able to adjust the room temperature to my preference. And for the third week in a row, I see a LG LCD TV in the hotel room. I guess LG has cornered the market on hotel TV sets.

As for hotel amenities, I only used the fitness center on the 2nd floor which has the basics. Bikes, treadmills and weights. There is a spa and pool on the 3rd floor in which you reach by going through the fitness center.

Really the only issue I had with my stay is with the room drapes. My room faced Metrotown which has lights blazing at night. It didn't seem like I could pull the drapes in so that my room was covered in darkness when going to bed.

Despite this, I enjoyed my stay here because it was the definition of the word convenient. I didn't have to go far for what I needed.",2012-06-08T00:28:47Z,108
373,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"This Hilton is a good choice if you don't need a hotel by the airport or in downtown Vancouver.

For me, the location is great. It is close to the huge Metrotown mall, near the Skyrtain, and you can walk out the lobby and straight into Crystal Mall and all of its great Asian food options. The room itself was clean, although the walls are pretty thin. The parking fee is decent as well, and you park in their private area, separate from the normal, chaotic parking scene of Crystal Mall. 

My room, including tax but excluding parking, was only $80 US, so very reasonable. If you have a car already and don' mind being outside of the downtown area, you should give this Hilton a try.",2015-04-19T04:17:15Z,108
374,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,Huge rooms with great views. Helpful staff especially Raj. He provided us with lots of information on sights to see and awesome places to eat. Clean property.

375,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Every time I come to Vancouver, THIS was the hotel I would always, always come to. Unfortunately, they changed the policy where free Wi-Fi is no longer provided during your stay, which was a big deal for me. I don't have international calling because it's not worth the additional fees for a few days but I was really disappointed when they started charging for $6.95 per day for Internet use. They even ask to upgrade it for a faster speed for $11. Obviously I need the Internet to look up directions and hot spots to check out so I bought the Internet and soon realized that the speed sucked and it was lagging the whole time. Also, the parking garage is a complete nutshell. The hotel is connected to a mall of some sort so it's just always crazy packed with crazy drivers speeding in every direction. 

Moving forward- I will be taking my stay elsewhere.",2016-03-29T05:16:59Z,108
376,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"So we stayed here May 5th-7th and my family was very pleased with our stay.  We came into town since I had some business to attend to in downtown Vancouver.  We could have easily stayed at hotel more centrally located, but the amenities and price beat those hotels out.

This hotel is literally 2 blocks away from the skytrain (which take note Seattle... something you should have done with years ago) its also 1.5 blocks away from Metrotown Mall ( basically the largest mall in BC). It comes with self parking for only $12 CAD or $16 for Valet (which compared to other Vancouver Hotels is a steal) , Peter Thomas Roth bathroom products, room service, and contrary to some reviews, the rooms do have black out curtains.

We stayed in a double queen room and found the beds to be very comfortable.  The room came with 1 flat screen tv and a small fridge.  I didn't realize you could request a microwave to be brought up to the room until after our stay (so they don't come standard in all rooms).

What really made our stay truly enjoyable was the breakfast host, Susheel.  His customer service was exceptional and truly made us feel as if we were at a 5 star luxury hotel.  We booked a room package that included free buffet breakfasts during our stay.  During our travels, most solid 3 star hotels lack decent breakfasts, and always lack decent customer service.  However, Susheel's customer service was amazing.  After seating our family, he came over to chat a couple of times.  He gave wonderful recommendations to my husband and kids for fun activities to do while I was in downtown for most of mid-day.  When we returned the very next day, he had remembered everyones names, and even the names of my younger children's stuffed animals!  Overall, we truly enjoyed our stay here and Susheel was the icing on the cake.  

We recommend this hotel if you are coming to Vancouver for a stay.  There is an Asian Mall attached- with a food court, a market and some small stores.  There is a grocery store up a block, and again the really great Metrotown Centre is across the street and was a hit with my family while i was gone.  There is inexpensive for only $12- which is a plus considering on my last stay to Vancouver in March, I paid an additional $30 USD for parking.  It's easy to get to downtown via the Skytrain - its like a 20 min ride and you don't have to deal with the headaches of traffic or getting lost.  We are looking forward to our next stay at the end of this summer.",2016-07-11T18:19:36Z,108
377,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Absolutely zero stars for housekeeping staff! But thank you to the front desk staff who did their best to correct the situation.

We stayed here for two nights after our wedding night. We live in another province but all our family is in the Metro Vancouver area and Hilton was a good location between our parents' homes. Since after the first night we were going back our parents' to pack up the rest of our things, we didn't leave any bags or luggage in the room. Just a few toiletries, some fruit, a sunglasses case and our breakfast voucher for the next day! I thought housekeeping always knows which rooms are checked out that day before cleaning the room. Apparently they were too lazy to do this here and just assumed the room was checked out. We got back to the room around 10PM and found none of our belongings. Immediately I figured that they threw everything out because they thought we were checked out.

I was looking forward to a relaxing evening since we had to be up at 6AM the next day for a long drive ahead. Instead, housekeeping caused a huge inconvenience. Down to the front desk we went to explain the situation. The woman working the front desk was able to locate the glasses case recorded in the lost and found. She also admitted fault on behalf of the hotel and took about 45 minutes to sort everything out while coming up with a solution. In the end they reimbursed us for our losses, gave us another voucher for breakfast and removed our parking fees. It was just an unnecessary hassle we had to deal with instead of relaxing for the rest of the night.

Other than this, our stay was great. The rooms are large, modern and clean. The hotel was nice enough to set up the room with (fake) flower pedals and chocolate covered strawberries, complete with the towels folded into the shape of swans on the bed. That was a nice touch and we certainly appreciate it on our special night.

One downside to this hotel is the pay parking. I'm happy we didn't have to pay for it but the hotel is located in Burnaby surrounded by a sea of free parking in almost every other building adjacent to the hotel. Heck, Hilton shares its parking lot with the adjoining Crystal Mall that offers free parking. On top of that, I've been to Crystal Mall numerous times and it's the worst designed parking lot I've ever seen. Other downsides include pay wi-fi and the air conditioner is a tad loud.",2013-09-12T02:30:42Z,108
378,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"My family and I genuinely had a great time at this hotel because it not only offers you a place to stay but also a fun experience.  Initially, I wasn't too excited about this hotel because it was pretty out of the way from downtown.  During rush hour traffic, driving to this hotel is awful.  It is pretty much stop and go.  It took us about 45 to 50 minutes to get here from Stanley Park.  

After we checked in, we were very happy with the hotel in general.  They have nice spacious lobby area for guests to lounge around. Our room was really clean.  I had booked from Priceline but my reservation didn't specify that I could get two queen sized beds.  I called the day of requesting this and they were very eager to accommodate.  Since we arrived later than we expected, I also asked for a late check out.  I got no attitude about this (sometimes the front desk gives you a hard time about this).  They were really nice and said they would be glad to give me a 3 pm check out time.

On top of it all, the hotel is located next to a very cute Asian market.  There are about two floors of Chinese shops.  You can buy Asian vegetables, fruits, newspapers, and etc.  I bought so many household handy wares at these little shops.  Also, there is a pretty busy food market located on the second floor.  I think going to the market is a wonderful experience because you can experience a little taste of Asia in Vancouver.  Oh yah, their bakeries are fabulous.  We bought a whole dozen of ""dang tas"" (Chinese egg tarts) to bring back home.",2014-06-11T00:48:08Z,108
379,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,Parking is affordable at $18. Friendly staff who appear to be prompt to fulfill your needs. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Noise level was pleasant. China town Mall connected to the Hilton makes it easy to explore and discover new things. Super market and liquor store across the street is convenient. There seems to be a flying ant problem outside that might be caused by the nearby construction. Training Pool was small and a little hard to find.,2019-07-10T17:05:10Z,108
380,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,Construction and elevator noise (anytime the elevator was activated you hear the shaft gears). Don't bother bringing up the elevator noise as they can't do anything about it. I did like the area and very close to shopping and the light rail train.

- have to pay an extra $16 per night to park.
- breakfast was not included in our $282/night stay.
- room service food and breakfast were below par.

384,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"/***** This is a review for the kitchen at the hotel *****/
I ordered a chicken Caesar salad for room service, which took 40mins to get to my room, after waiting that long for just a salad I called the front office, which said it was coming up as I called, but still took 6mins in an elevator? That's not necessarily why I gave them a bad rating though, when I opened my dish top I got a horrible smell of charr, the chicken seemed fine at first glance, but when I flipped them over more than half of my chicken was charred. You could tell that the chief deliberately turned over his mistake instead of remaking it, when I called the office again this time they said they could remake it, but I wasn't about to wait a total of 1 hour and 20mins for a salad. Being a diamond member I expected more than that kind of service from the kitchen and the front office, which did little to fix the problem. Needless to say I went to a great restaurant across the street called Earls, which I would recommend any day over burned room service food that's expense $17 for a chicken Caesar that is burned just isn't worth it.",2017-02-19T00:27:56Z,108

We did not use the hot tub or pool that is located on the third floor and provides a great view of the nights skyline. 

Wifi is very hit and miss in the hotel, even in the areas where it is located has being available. 

The rooms are nice and modern, but do not come with a refridgerator but when asked they delivered one.  The housekeeping staff was excellent and also very helpful with directions. Laundry service is very expensive and per piece. For $4.00, I did a large load at a local laundromat about 10 minutes away.

Parking is also around $10 dollars a day for self park in a very large confusing garage.

Overall  this is a great hotel and I would stay here again with hesitation; however, the minor aspects of wifi, parking costs, and location from the city make it a three star verses five.",2012-10-11T20:02:01Z,108

We LOVED everything about this hotel. Beds are super comfy (1 king bed) with a mini fridge. There are blackout curtains (contrary to other reviews) and it was super quiet and cozy. 

It is 2 blocks away from the SkyTrain so we took the train downtown and spent the day around Glanville island. We love Vancouver and are super excited to be here. The staff was so friendly and helpful and I would definitely recommend this hotel!",2016-07-22T01:27:19Z,108
389,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"This year brought another great stay!

I travel to Vancouver once a year and for the past three I've decided to stay at the Hilton, and this year a couple of friends joined me. Unfortunately hilton.com wasn't showing dual queen-bed rooms, but a quick call to their in-house reservations team got us squared away. However, a day before my arrival I went and checked my reservation and noticed it was a single king bed. Called the front desk and found out they bumped me up to a suite, which on another trip would of been awesome, except we had a need for two beds as neither my fellow traveler nor myself wanted to sleep on the pull out couch bed. This was quickly taken care of by the agent.

All the perks in my previous review are still there. Close to mass transit, just two skytrains from YVR Airport or a skytrain and bus if you want the more direct root (but same amount of time). Restaurants everywhere, but there has been a lot of construction in the area an they are already opening new shops and restaurants.

The customer service here alone will keep me coming back.",2015-10-09T22:44:44Z,108
390,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"We stayed here for 4 nights during our recent trip to Vancouver in July 2018. It was the busy season for Vancouver and the Hotel was completely booked. We really enjoyed out stay even though we could not get upgrade as a diamond member due to the full capacity. The Hotel has an opal lounge for both Gold and Diamond members for evening Hors d'oeuvre, sandwiches and some fruits and vegetables. You can also get a quick breakfast in the Opal lounge, but their continental breakfast in the Reflect Restaurant is phenomenal. It has very good selection of pastries, and hot breakfast, and you can order Eggs Benedict or Omelette etc. My favorite breakfast item is their Buda Bar which has more than 10 different healthy choices to choose from. The Hotel has a small swimming pool (they call it lap pool), but it's only about 20 yards and a bit small. There is also a small hot tub, which comes in handy at the end of the day. The Hotel is located very close to a Metro station which takes you directly to Vancouver. We did not get a chance to use the Public Transportation because we had rental car. The parking is reasonable at C$16 per night. We drove to Vancouver several times, and, to our surprise, it was actually not very difficult to find parking in Vancouver, a contrast to what I read before our trip. You can easily find meter parking anywhere from C$2-5 per hour or garage parking. Absolutely not like what you experience in New York. During the weekend, the parking is even easier. We drove to Gas Town and parked on a meter for C$2 per hour for several hours and walked around and eat and drove to Stanley Park (Which has parking meter too). The major advantage of driving is that you can visit several places in one day and efficiently at a reasonable cost. I compared this place vs. the other Hilton Property Hampton Inn in Downtown and we are glad we chose this one with a rental car. We visited so many different places and enjoyed our stay very much. The Hotel staffs are very friendly and helpful. The business center has color printer for you to use. There is a big Chinese market next to it with fresh fruits and vegetables and plenty of restaurants around.",2018-10-20T19:58:08Z,108
391,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"We booked a room here because my boyfriend had Hilton points. It's not in downtown Vancouver; in fact, it's in Burnaby, but I knew that when booking it. 

It's a bit far away from downtown and as a tourist up for the weekend without a car, we did spend quite a bit of time on the train getting around. 

Still, I was up for it- while some people were disgusted by the food smells wafting from the Crystal Mall, I was intrigued by it, and knew it would be perfect location for us, as we love to eat, especially Asian food! 

The food court in the Crystal Mall is seriously awesome!  We also went to a Dim Sum restaurant in the Mall one morning, so I enjoyed the amenities the Mall offered.  It's not for everyone, though.  Um, but Beard Papa's is, and it's ALSO in the mall! 

Our room was on the 9th floor, I think, and afforded a great view- when it was clear enough to see, the view was really pretty.  We had a little suite, which was nice, because in the afternoons I could take a little nap or listen to music and lie in bed while my guy messed with his computer in the other room at the desk. 

Clean and comfortable.  The bed was nice. Bathroom nothing special. I really liked being on a higher floor and gazing out at the skyline and neighboring buildings. 

No special treatment from the desk, and at one point we walked right past the concierge bell-hop guy to hail our own cab.  However, if you need a cab they will call one for you. The pool was out of service and being repaired but they gave us an informational sheet of paper that had a local community pool available!  Had I been there for more than 5 days, I would have been IN that pool. 

Because of the distance from downtown, I might not stay here the next time I am in Vancouver.  But then again, i really did like it!  Would likely be easier with a car or scooter in the summer!",2011-01-13T00:10:29Z,108
392,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Nothing bad but also nothing really memorable during my short stay.  Parking garage is a nightmare to navigate through...it's shared with the Crystal Mall and we all know Chinese people are the worst drivers.  What's nice is you can just walk right through the lobby into the mall so if you're hungry..there's a good variety of food in their food court..  The boba tea joint was really good.

The bed in the rooms were awesome....loved the sheets.  one thing I did notice that wasn't cool was there wasn't any toothpaste or free toothbrushes.",2013-03-12T03:13:22Z,108
393,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Probably the best place you can stay in Burnaby, great for family vacations.  I've stayed here 3 times over the last two years. Every time has been perfect for what we wanted to do in British Columbia.

The first time we stayed on a whim, straying from our normal downtown Vancouver hotels.  Its been a great discovery staying at Hilton Metrotown instead.  Upon driving up, the valet immediately comes up to help - even in the middle of the night.  The staff are very attentive to needs.  When seeing that we had our baby daughter they immediately asked if we wanted a crib.  ""What? Yes, baby station please!"" Then we were moved into a nice private corner room behind two doors which was perfect for a crying child at night, away from other guests.  The staff are always excellent at making your stay relaxing with their clear and calm attitude about your needs.  

The beds here are sweet; wonderful mattress, and sheets/pillows that caress your body.  My wife loves that Crabtree & Evelyn products are in the bathroom. The restaurant is great for breakfast buffet, and uncrowded enough for us to enjoy a meal.  This would be a 5-star stay except that the outdoor swimming pool is really narrow, but the hot tub is a good spot to relax overlooking the city streets and park.  We still take a dip to enjoy what we can.

The location is actually cool for the urban adventurer.  We left our car behind and ventured out to the new SkyTrain system and always manage to get to all the places we want to like Downtown Vancouver and Richmond.  Its a much better way to discover the area.  Also, we love going to the connected chinese mall and the area restaurants. There is a large open park right across the street.  The Pittsburg Cafe on Kingsway is particularly good (HK Food: chaa chaa teng).

Hilton Metrotown is definitely our first choice from now on when staying in BC. I became a Hilton member as a result of this hotel, a little unhappy we weren't credited for our past stays, but we will make future stays with summer coming up. We would have stayed here when we came for the Olympics if possible, but staying anywhere was impossible around BC at that time.",2010-06-17T06:00:05Z,108
394,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"I stayed on the sixth floor in a room with one king bed. The room was nice and the bed was very comfortable. There was a nice flat screen tv, but it did not have a guide button so you had to manually click through each channel to see what is on tv. There is a button that allows you to see what channels are where, like NBC or ABC. The in-room movies are a rip off at 17 bucks / show and they charge $1 per local call. I was disappointed that they charged $49 / night for a pet fee for my tiny dog :( 

The workshop I attended was on the 3rd floor, and was awesome. The location of the hotel is great if you want to go to the mall / movie theater, but there are not a lot of good restaurants in walking distance. The restaurant in the hotel is good though and there are a variety of items to choose from. 

The staff are excellent - from the front desk to the valets to the servers - I can't say enough about how awesome the service is.",2013-05-30T23:51:02Z,108
395,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,Pretty good experience here - this is my 2nd time back at this hotel.  Check in was great - very friendly staff.  Parking is under the hotel (nice that it's covered).  We were upgraded to a higher floor upon check in - didn't really care but it was a nice gesture on their part.  As Hilton diamond members we had access to the executive lounge - decent selection of appetizers in the evening and the individual taking care of the guests was fantastic!  Breakfast in the lounge - ok - would have liked more food options.  The lounge is also on the smaller side compared to other Hilton executive lounges - fits probably 20-25 people at best comfortably - more than that and your standing in a corner.  Walking distance to the big giant mall across the street.,2017-11-23T05:48:57Z,108
396,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"I attended a Cosmetology Industry Association AGM here this afternoon that was held in their Crystal Ballroom.  It's probably not fair to review the entire hotel based on my experience today (especially because I didn't stay overnight) but I'm still going to write this.  

First of all, the parking lot that is shared with the Crystal Mall has to be the worst parking lot in the Lower Mainland.  

Once inside the hotel, the lobby, ballroom (which served as our convention room) and common areas are clean and well maintained.  The service staff I encountered were hard at work but weren't necessarily friendly.  

There was a typical business style light lunch being served buffet style.  The coffee was weak, the pastries didn't look too appetizing and the sandwiches were average.  The fruit and veggie platters looked nice though.  

If I ever have the opportunity to have dinner here I will review this place again because there is a good chance that a more involved meal would result in a higher rating but for now, two stars.",2010-09-26T23:40:25Z,108
397,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"The service is great, people friendly, food delicious, and room quality excellent. 

Before we arrived, I emailed the hotels requesting dining recommendations and asking questions.  We received a quick, thorough courteous response.  We checked in to one of the happiest check in clerks I've met in the Hilton franchise. That was a welcome sight after a long day of delayed travel.

Our room in the Executive level was perfectly set up and fully functional. The shower pressure and water temperature were excellent, especially considering a high floor.

Housekeeping has done a great job with the rooms before and during our stay.

We received a HHonors Gold room upgrade, which included access to the small Executive Lounge.  When it was full one morning, the attendant offered breakfast coupons to people willing to go to the main dining room. As for coffee in paper cups, heck, I prefer that! I want to be able to get my coffee to go. 

One more thing ... great wifi. Free for HHonors members, stable, and the non-premium speed was nonetheless fast for viewing email and videos.  The SkyRail station was only a 5 minute walk.

I've been Hilton Elite for many years. I've seen some good Hiltons and some bad ones. This one is very good.",2016-07-08T22:31:29Z,108
398,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Stayed here on NYE 2012 for the Glitz n Glamour Dinner and Dance and had a fabulous time! The party itself was amazing. The Hilton is an incredible venue with different ballrooms available for different parties. 

The largest, the Crystal Ballroom is absolutely beautiful when all decorated and seated about 400-500 people for dinner that night. The Tiffany Ballroom is located across the hall and while it is smaller, still decorated beautifully with balloons and lights everywhere.

The room level I chose was King Bed and the price was higher than it usually is but acceptable considering it was New Years Eve and the place would likely book up fast. The hotel lobby is clean and bright. There was no line-up when I arrived (3:30pm) and when it looked like everyone was busy, an Assistant came out of nowhere and helped me right away. 

Because I signed up to become an 'Honors Member', the Front Desk Associate made sure to advise me of the upgrade I received on the floor. As I have visited before, I can definately say that I received a higher floor and much nicer view than in the past. I was really happy with that and I determined that it's probably worth signing up and visiting a few times to get the extra little perks. 

My room was very clean and nicely decorated. There was a large desk and chaise lounge in front of the gigantic window which looked inviting and classy. The bed was comfortable and seemed crisp. The stereo was pre-programmed which was nice. Music with the push of one button seemed almost too simple and I could hook up my ipod as well (if I had thought to bring it). Flat screen and plenty of space to put things away were great too. 

With the party downstairs and my room upstairs, it worked out wonderfully. The staff were able to secure the party area and still allow people to flow from the ballrooms to their rooms and to the outside easily which made the night seamless. 

After an amazing night in a fashionable hotel, I woke up and didn't want it all to end so soon, so I called the front desk around 7am to request a late checkout. They replied that it was my privledge as an 'Honors Member' and told me to have a nice sleep (the lady sounded really pleasant as well).

All in all I had a great experience with the staff and with the event I was attending. I was impressed with the Hilton Metrotown and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone else. See you again next year! :)",2013-01-03T04:14:21Z,108
399,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Stayed in the king suite with my husband and one other couple. The room had lots of space, but I wish there had been a second sink outside the bathroom as it's cramped sharing one sink across so many adults. The pull out queen was comfy. Maybe a bit squeaky, but that didn't really bother any of us.
If you are a diamond hhonors, the opal lounge on the 18th floor is a huge perk. We all enjoyed hot breakfast each morning, and the hors d'oeuvres were way above my expectations! Free sodas, waters, and an honor system cash bar. 
Location was convenient to sky train which was key as there is little night life in the area. The hotel has plenty of self parking ($11/day), but shares the garage with the mall next door. Getting in and out of the garage was pretty stressful.",2014-10-19T15:53:55Z,108
400,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Hosted a Christmas party at the Hilton this past season and I have nothing but good things to say. They did a great job with food and setting up the ballroom, as well as amazing waiting staff who were friendly and patient with all the guests. Would definitely recommend to any businesses looking to host an event here.",2017-03-03T22:36:10Z,108
401,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"I like the Hilton chain and happen to love the Hilton beds, so much so that I almost bought one myself!  For some reason, the hype is all about the Westin Heavenly beds, but for me, the Hilton beds rock.

The Hilton chain is good value for the money with my only pet peeve being the fact that they charge for internet.  Aside from that, I love the rooms and the toiletries (Crabtree and Evelyn) and customer service is great at this location.  Parking is not a problem and this location is convenient if you need to be near Metrotown... which is right across the street.  It's not that great of a location if you need to be in Vancouver itself otherwise you'll need a car or have to Skytrain it.

I've stayed here a few times and no issues at all.  Would come back again.",2009-09-15T03:27:16Z,108
402,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"The list of things that make a hotel for me:

- Big comfy bed to sprawl on? Check.
- Black-out curtains so I don't have to wake up extra early? Check.
- Plenty of fluffy towels in the bathroom? Check.
- Decent soap and lotions in bathroom to steal? Check.
- Enough insulation in the walls that I can't hear the neighbors? Check.
- Quick check in and out? Check and check.
- More TV channels than I have at home (bonus points if it includes the Canadian comedy channel!)? CHECK!

That the Hilton Metrotown hits all of the above makes it a solid choice, if maybe not the most exciting or up to date of hotels. But, I'd rather stay at a place that does what I need well than take a risk on a trendier but possibly less well run hotel. Plus, the homefries that come with some of the breakfasts are awesome. 

As others have noted in their reviews, this Hilton isn't really in Vancouver. I consider that a good thing. Not that I don't like Vancouver, but I like that being in Burnaby means that the nightly rates are about $40 cheaper than comparable hotels in Vancouver proper. A tiny bit of inconvience is worth the extra money.

And yes, the giant mall is right next door, but I think that it might need a seperate review to convey the overwhelming awesomeness. But just as a hint, there's not just one, but TWO supermarkets in this mall.",2009-08-17T19:56:23Z,108
403,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"So, this weekend has been a very stressful one  during our long road trip. Our car got broken into in Vancouver Chinatown, and they stole 2 of our backpacks which contained laptop and other important things. It happened on a Friday night, and we needed a safe place to park our car since both of the rear windows got smashed. Thank goodness we found Hilton. The manager, Anthony, was very gracious and helpful. He let us book a room at a cheaper rate, and the service there was impeccable. They let us park in their garage so that it would be in a more secure spot, and they were super hospitable. I felt safer there, and felt that this hotel was a great support system for us.",2017-03-27T02:14:14Z,108
404,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Though I haven't stayed overnite before, I'm sure they use pretty good quality bedding, minimum T250 thread count, from what I hear ;)

I love the fact that it's connected to Crystal Mall and its wide selection food court, albeit mostly Asian but for the bang for the buck, wow, it's worth the jibe eating here.

And you still have a few floors of retail shopping, mostly mom pop clothing stores, cell phones, salons, kitchen ware, and even a few other restos connected too, like the hot pot and HK style cafe..will report on this evenutally.

But my hotel reviews aren't complete unless the washrooms are rated ;)))  Other than the fact it's a long way up to the 3rd level where the gorgeous ballrooms are, they're immaculately clean and seat covers are readily available.  Well lit too, and no one can ever know you're using the washrooms.  

Lobby/front desk is way off to the right if you're coming thru the parkade, where you take the escalators on the right to the promised land for those emergencies ;)  Plus there's 4 stalls which is quite a bit by men's standards haha",2012-05-07T01:36:47Z,108
405,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"I got booked here for a month, so they upgraded me to a suite, so that was nice. The price was mid range I suppose for a major city so I probably got what I paid for. 

The parking garage is horrible to drive in and out of. It is shared by some other company, I think HSBC. At around 530 there is some sort of shift change and coming in or leaving is brutal for the next half hour or so. The employees also seem to have a hard time parking, so if one of them stops in front of you get ready for some laughs. 

The restaurants around the area are not anything special and might even be considered on the bad side. I'll say they range from bad to average. The wifi is only in the restaurant, and the internet in your room is through a cable attached to your desk. So... no netflix in your bed which isn't all that bad, but I would have liked the option one night or two.

You're not close to anything interesting besides the train that takes you downtown. That's a plus though. The room service food is not at all good. You are much better off just going to mcdonalds or stopping at the grocery store for some fruit and granola. I've been eating oranges and granola like nobodies business. 

If you're here for an extended time, they do not have mini fridges in the room. So every meal is a dining out experience basically.

Everything is clean though, the workout room is nice, and the cleaning staff does a good job. Some of my work friends complained about not getting some things in their rooms replaced, but they were good on everything for me except body wash. I didn't even know they had it here until about 2 weeks into my trip.

If you really don't feel like leaving the hotel, you're going to get over charged for breakfast and any meals really. Some things to note ; the potatoes are instant, the veggies don't taste fresh, and the croissants are HORRIBLE. How can a croissant be horrible? By not being a pastry, and only having the outside look of a croissant. Dry, and smooth is the texture, instead of buttery and flaky. They are bad enough that I had to call it out. 

Your best bet, go to the holiday inn express, get a fridge and pack it up. Please listen to me though, avoid the croissants.",2012-01-29T21:28:56Z,108
406,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"I have stayed here twice, the first time I didn't know it was so far from downtown, the second time it was for work.

Both times I got upgraded upon check-in (Hilton Diamond member).  The lobby is kind of small, there is a restaurant and bar on the second floor but I have never been to it because this HIlton is connected to a big Chinese mall with a great food court.  If you want to speak Cantonese or want to practice your Cantonese while staying at a HIlton this is it, I don't want to be stereotypical but almost everyone that works there looks like me.  

When i got a room here in November of 2009, the suite I got put in was spacious, it was on the corner so I had views of two different sides, everything was up-to-date with from the LCD TV to the furniture.  The valet parking was not bad either considering the hours of night I was coming and going for work.",2010-01-21T06:22:14Z,108
407,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"I tend to stay at Hilton chain hotels because they have an awesome rewards program.

We only needed a room for the night to have a place to stay during my birthday outing in Vancouver.  Using reward points, we made our reservation online.  The rate was awesome and the location was nestled conveniently near lots of shopping and the Sky Train (which takes you into downtown).  I mentioned that this stay would be over my birthday in the comments section of the reservation booking screen, and the staff very kindly wished me a ""happy birthday"" upon check-in.  We were generously upgraded into a suite, and once we were situated inside, were gifted with a delicious treat off of the dessert menu...Triple Chocolate Cake, a yummy white, milk, and dark chocolate cake with mango-passion coulis.

My only negative comment would be that there is no Wi-Fi in the rooms.  There is cabled internet, but that's a total pain when you just want to use your iPhone.

The staff has been super friendly and I would definitely recommend staying here.",2012-07-08T07:03:18Z,108
408,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Our family stayed here for two nights.  We had our teenage daughter with us so we needed two beds.  Many, many other hotels in Vancouver had only two full size beds.  Just impossible for me to get rest with two in a small bed.  I was so pleased to find that Hilton Metrotown has two queen beds!!  

Even though it was a bit out of the downtown area, that did not bother me.  They have a parking garage below the hotel and it's a very reasonable daily charge.  Other hotels were $30+ a day.  Also, the skytrain is about a 2 block walk and will take you anywhere you want to go.  We took it down to Canada Place/Gastown and it took less than 15 minutes.

Our room's wall was next to the elevators which worried me about noise, but it must have been insulated very well as it was not noisy at all.  Someone mentioned the curtains not being dark enough to black out the city lights.  I thought they were fine.  I would wake up in the morning and was not even sure if it was light out yet since the room was still so dark.  Had to open the curtain a crack to see and found that it was  a bright sunny morning.

The pool is only accessed through the fitness room and up these back stairs.  Very strange access to the pool.  Not so sure it is handicap accessable if someone has issues with stairs.  You would have to ask the staff if they have another way to the pool/hot tub.

The hotel is right across the street from a major mall.  There is a grocery store about a block walk and a starbucks next to it.    If you like chinese food, there is a chinese mall attached to the hotel with a foodcourt - all chinese food.  Smelled good, but we took a pass and walked to the Red Robin for burgers, which were excellent.  We did not try the hotel restaurant. 

I would definitely stay here again on a repeat visit.  Very nice staff, quiet, clean, really nice experience.

Update:   Watch your credit card numbers folks!!  My husband used his mastercard only one time in Vancouver at the Starbucks nearby.  Someone got his number, made a new card and used it at the apple store at the Metrotown Mall nextdoor to buy $1600 in apple products.  Wtf???  I'm gonna let that Starbucks know that they  need to watch their help or that someone is accessing their numbers.",2012-07-02T03:31:52Z,108

Pros: they participate in the Hilton ""huanying"" program which caters to Chinese tourists - make sure to ask for nice slippers.  Location is right next to an Asian mall, so food is very convenient.  Reasonable rates.  Provides 2 bottles of water daily for no charge.

413,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"To me this is a modest 4 star hotel. Nothing extravagant, extraordinary or eye catching but it is decently priced if booked in advance, eg king size bed (1bedrom) plus sofabed living for $120. Service is good, staff are well mannered and pleasant. They had a 2 for 1 breakfast buffet for $25 so for $12.50/ person I'd say it was worth it but definitely not worth full price. The breakfast is completely self serve (no made to order omelet, nor ham server). Fruit is abundant with a mixed variety of canned and fresh offerings. Pastries are homemade style and abundant. Cup yogurt, scoop ur own oatmeal, orange juice all included. The hot plates served sausage, bacon, hash and french toast. I really hoped for eggs benedict but for the price I was a bit too optimistic. Location is great, it's adjacent to crystal mall (a Chinese Mall) with tons of decent food court stalls (2nd floor) and many brick n mortars on the bottom floor along with very well priced groceries-hence the line ups. I would stay here again.",2015-09-22T05:56:42Z,108
414,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"I honestly can't remember how the hotel looks or how the room looks.  We were in town visiting family and decided to stay here for the last two nights, so we were only in the room to sleep.  Although when I think of this hotel, I hear the sound of fire alarms blaring in my sleep...this is probably because at around 2am on the first night we arrived, a false fire alarm kept going off every 30 mins.  We were pretty upset, because we were exhausted...I'm sure all the guests there were exhausted and complaining.  

However, I'm not one to knock down stars if the business handled our complaints professionally and efficiently.  As always, the Hilton resolved the problem to my highest standards.  Dumb me decided to book my stay through Priceline, even though the price on priceline was the same as Hilton's website...don't ask me why I wasn't thinking...as a Hilton Honors' member, I should've remembered that booking through Hilton's website would get me more honors points.  This was the main reason, I wasn't able to get a refund to my credit card.  Instead the manager on duty gave me credit for one night in form of Hilton Honors point and I truely appreciate this gesture.

We'll definitely remain as Hilton family patrons.

Thank you from California.",2011-10-17T06:00:32Z,108
415,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"I had a pleasant experience at the Hilton Vancouver Metrotown.

Admittedly, it's deceiving. This Hilton is located in Burnaby, not in Vancouver. Maybe if they said something like the Vancouver Metropolitan Area or something to that effect, it could be justified. But to get here, you'll have to drive, although public transit isn't a problem since the SkyTrain will drop you off at the mall.

Metrotown is the huge mall across the street. British Columbia's biggest and brightest, and it is a pretty big mall, complete with all the shops you'd expect anywhere in the States, and more. If you have time, stop by there. But if you're confined to your hotel, there's actually a little mini-mall complete with food court and groceries at the Hilton itself. Most of the stores sell things that Morning Glory or Hello Kitty would, and there's a spa or two, so it's really more like a small-business plaza more than anything else.

The hotel staff were extremely courteous. There's a multi-level parking garage in the basement of the building for the mall-goers and a separate section for Hilton guests. Unfortunately, it's $6/night to park there, but it's better to do that than to leave your car out on the street. You can get into the garage yourself during the day through the main garage entrance, but after hours (around 11pm or so) you have to stop by the lobby and they let you in the front entrance.

Next to the concierge there are three computers for hotel guests to use, free of charge. The room we got was just a standard hotel room, nothing overly fancy but well-maintained and clean. Glade plug-in for an added touch. There wasn't really a view of any sort from our room, but at $80/night through Hotwire, I had no complaints. Complimentary newspaper at the door in the morning, and your standard television stations tickle your inner dork when they talk about it being 20 degrees the next day.

The fitness center is composed of a couple of treadmills and such, nothing terribly fancy. You walk up another stairwell to go to the pool, which is unfortunately not that impressive - not very long at all and more or less an arm's width across. It was packed with a family when we went to check it out, and there's not much more room for anyone else.

Nevertheless, I'd definitely stay here again. Without a car it's difficult to get anywhere in Vancouver, but if you're mobile then it's a pretty good place to stay.",2008-09-12T06:45:33Z,108

417,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive, the property is clean and the room size is more than adequate.

I spent my entire stay taking the SkyTrain back and forth on business to the convention center downtown. The close proximity to the Metrotown station made this easy.

The on property restaurant definitely got the job done, but the gym was on the small/basic side (basic cardio and dumb bells only).

Definitely a good option if you are looking for a convenient downtown option without downtown prices.",2013-10-06T01:03:15Z,108
418,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Stayed here for a 3 night weekend with one of my friends and had a great time. The bartender Steve was the nicest man I've ever met. It even happened to be his birthday one day and he shared his cake with us and had us sign his card. Eddy was a room service worker that was extremely friendly and kept bringing us food to the room we never ordered. The location is wonderful for not being downtown. There is a mall across the street with everything you could need, a Asian supermarket next door, and the SkyTrain is only a block away and a 15 minute straight shot to Granville Street. I was a bit surprised by the front desk and porters. Not one of them smiled or was friendly while having a conversation, it was like I was talking to a brick wall and the porters were VERY worried about their luggage carts. If you wanted to use one they would chase you down and repeat over and over they need it back immediately so that was weird but everything else was amazing!",2018-05-01T02:32:42Z,108
419,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"I choose this location for my business trip as it was as far away as I could go from downtown Vancouver without sacrificing the commute.

The staff was civil, as they are required and paid to be. I had gotten mixed treatment from them, as they are more friendly when I was wearing a suit vs. plain clothes. The only people that seemed genuine were a few of the hotel porters, they remembered me and was always ready to suggest where to go. 

The hotel amenities were standard Hilton, but the food was not. This is the location where I had the most number of complaints about the food.",2011-09-06T20:14:16Z,108

422,Hilton Vancouver Metrotown,3.8,"Highly recommend the Hilton for business functions. Very professional, organized and accommodating.

423,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"The JW Marriott Parq Vancouver is true luxury and I had one of the most fantastic Marriott stays I've ever had here. 

My husband and I stayed at the JW for our honeymoon. From the start, we were greeted kindly by the staff. They regularly provided us with water and ensured we had a pleasant stay. We had a beautiful room with a large window overlooking the water. The room was clean and modern and so so comfortable! My husband typically hates hotels, but he fell in love with the JW and never wanted to leave! The hotel has a little spa area on the roof with a small outdoor jacuzzi. Additionally, there is a restaurant in the lobby and you can order delicious room service!

The hotel was so lovely. My mom had sent us a cheese board and floors to celebrate our honeymoon and we enjoyed this with a bottle of wine sitting on the little lookout bench in our room. 

We had one issue with our charges at the end of the stay that took a while to get sorted out after we left, but eventually it was fixed. Other than that, this was such an excellent stay and we'll forever remember getting to enjoy our honeymoon here!",2024-04-07T23:58:01Z,95
424,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"The JW Marriott was a fantastic hotel.  We stayed during Christmas holiday 2023.  We booked a king guestroom, but we were upgraded to a one bedroom king suite with a water view a week prior to our arrival.  Check in was quick by Hubet.  We were given a room on the 9th floor.  

The room was at the end of a hallway.  As you entered the room, it went into a living room with sofa, tv and table.  The windows were floor to ceiling and gave a good view of both BC Place and the water.  The bedroom had a great water view and a king bed.  But, my wife still would've preferred a higher floor for a better view.  The bathroom was large and had a bathtub, and a walk in shower that included a handshower.  Molton Brown products were provided in the bathroom.  The room was large with 600 sq. ft.  

This hotel has an executive lounge for platinum elite members and above, and also for customers who pay for entry.  This was one of the nicest executive lounges that I've been to.  It is open from 6AM until 10 PM.  Breakfast is served in the morning.  They served scrambled eggs, potatoes, and either pancakes or waffles for breakfast.  In addition, they also had fresh fruit, smoked salmon, various juices, including an orange juicing machine.  Hors d'oeuvres are served every night with something different served every night.  The JW lounge did not go cheap like many of the Marriott M-Clubs who only serve egg rolls and samosas.  They had a different chef every night cook a main dish.  They served dishes like fried rice, oxtail stew, and chicken.  Along with these dishes, they also had salad, soup, and desserts.  The food was so good that I didn't have to go out very much, except for lunchtime, and when I wanted to pig out and visit a restaurant even when I wasn't hungry.  

Their gym, spa and pool are located on one of the upper floors. The gym was one of the best hotel gyms that I have seen.  The equipment was newer.  They had cardio equipment, weight machines, and free weights.  Cleaning wipes and towels are provided.  The pool was outdoors, but, it was way too cold for me to use it.  

Housekeeping staff worked like ninjas.  They do not push around a traditional housekeeping cart.  Instead, the ones I saw had a small suitcase on wheels.  They used to stairs to get from floor to floor instead of the elevators.  They were very efficient!

They have a nice serene park located on the 6th floor.  The Park Vancouver Casino and the Douglas Hotel is located in the same building.  With the BC Place next door, you might see the visiting hockey team and referees at the hotel.  

This was a great property for us to stay at.  We definitely felt the luxury of staying at a JW.  If we went to Vancouver again, we would definitely consider staying at this JW Marriott again.",2024-01-19T05:56:05Z,95
425,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"Unfortunately, I had a relatively bad experience here. Overall, the hotel lacked the attention to detail and care I would expect for the price point. I had booked one king bed with a water view for my birthday weekend. I had also planned to order a bottle of wine to the room to celebrate when we checked in. I was hoping to have a convenient and luxurious experience for my birthday after a stressful week at work, and this hotel failed to live up. 

We got to the front desk at 3:55 p.m. for a 4:00 p.m. check in and we were told our room was not ready yet. We had to settle for a 2 bd queen with no water view because the room we booked would be another 1-2 hours before it was ready. What??? 5 mins before check-in time, and it's not ready? We had dinner reservations at 5:00 and were going to the Canucks vs. Kraken game at 7:00, so we didn't have time to sit around waiting for our room. Nothing was offered for our inconvenience except a ""Sorry!""

Due to the room snafu, the bottle of wine I had ordered was not ready. At 4:30, I called guest services to have it delivered. They brought up the wrong bottle of wine, so I had to call again. They brought up the correct bottle by 4:45 but we didn't have time to open it like I'd hoped because we had to get to dinner at 5:00. Again, the only thing offered was a ""Sorry!"" 

Dinner at the Honey Salt restaurant was good, and the waiter got us out of there by 6:30 so we could make it to the game on time. My only nitpick is that drink service was slow. Would eat there again and recommend. The mushroom appetizer was my favorite! 

The location of the hotel is great to go to Canucks games and opposing players and refs stay at this hotel, so you might run into some while you stay. We saw one Kraken player and one ref while we were there. 

After the game, we went to the casino. Couldn't stand to stay for more than an hour because the second floor was so hot! Was losing money on slots anyway, so I got out of there. 

We didn't sleep well in the room we didn't book because the heater in the room made a loud THUNK every time it turned off. No fun! 

We pre-ordered room service breakfast for arrival at 10:00. It did not arrive until 10:20, which set us back 20 mins on our plans for the day. Annoying!! The food itself, though, was great! 

After sharing my experience with the front desk at check out, he apparently comped my breakfast and valet parking, but I don't know if that actually happened. 

Overall, feeling pretty miffed by the experience and would try somewhere else if I return to downtown Vancouver for a long weekend.",2023-12-05T08:59:12Z,95
426,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"This is considered a luxury hotel, but definitely feels like it. The hotel staff is exremely polite and remembered our names when greeting us ondifferent occassions. We booked the hotel through AE and was greeted with a welcome chocolate. Within the room, it was very clean and came with hotel slippers and robes. The shampoo/conditioner/lotion were all great smelling and did not dry out your skin like some hotel products do.

There happened to be a conference there on one of the days we were staying and the staff maneuvered everyone very efficiently despite how busy it was and when everyone was leaving at the same time. 

The hotel is in a prime location where you can walk out and connect to a walking trail. It is not too far away from getting to food and desirable destinations. Additionally, within the hotel, was THE BEST gym I have ever seen. On top of having almost every equipment immaginable, it also overlooked the city. Downstairs is Honey Salt which is also a great eatery and right next door was gelato. Connected to the hotel is a Casino if you want to gamble.

The only downside I had was their coffee maker was kind of janky and we lost multiple coffee pods because it was not turning on and dislodging the pods; but we called and got more pods very quickly. Overall, fantastic experience!",2023-08-05T02:36:46Z,95
427,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"This review is only for their Executive Lounge where I was given the opportunity to have breakfast there while working that morning for the hotel. Definitely a ""wow"" factor as most hotel lounges that I have experienced are at a full service hotel. Presentation of the buffet area was lovely with the highlight being the fresh squeezed automated orange juicer that squeezed whole oranges into the glass you place at the end of the spout. The Lounge has two separate areas with the buffet area in the middle. Lounge areas are spacious and nicely furnished.",2023-12-12T05:35:18Z,95

429,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"All the staff from the front desk to concierge were all extremely kind and had a smile on their face. We were there to spend a night for our babymoon and the concierge delivered a hand written note as well as a JW Marriott chocolate bar to our room to welcome us. We asked for a late check out and the front desk gave us new keys that will work until the late check out time which was super helpful! 

The bedding was super comfortable and plush and everything was very clean. The king room we stayed in had complimentary water, tea, coffee and a biscoff cookie. The bathroom was nice! It consisted of a step in rain shower with the option to have a hand held shower head. The toilet was in its own room behind another door. The robe was super comfortable too. 

Probably the only downside would be the cost of parking which was $50 per night... apart from that...

10/10 would recommend!",2022-08-23T08:07:50Z,95

I'm a Marriott fan, but the layout and amenities at this location truly impressed me. They have 6+ restaurants in house to choose from for dining, the fitness facility is top notch and has a full squat rack and you are a 5 minute walk to the water to take a ferry to Granville Island.

We were on the 20th floor, water view and the room was vibrating from the sound check of the Ed Sheeran concert the next day. It was awful and gave me a headache. I called the front desk and they said there was nothing they could do. It was so awful that I had to leave the hotel room and not return until 9pm and then I checked out first thing in the morning. Also, the patron next to me complained and was moved to a different floor but when I asked there were no more rooms available. Highly disappointed with the customer service regard this situation.",2023-09-06T17:52:22Z,95
433,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"Lovely hotel, great staff, gorgeous facilities. But if you have food allergies, don't eat at the hotel. I'm a middle-aged woman on a plant-based diet for heart health, and I have Celiac. The one ""healthy"" salad on the menu is small, gritty, and has an oily dressing we couldn't eat. The first night, we ordered a veggie curry that showed up glistening with oil and had shrimp. From room service we ordered ice-cream that the menu identified as vegan, and  told the rep we were vegan when I ordered. The next night, I ordered the same ice-cream, and was told the menu is not correct and it actually has dairy. From that point, we never ate at the hotel. Guests with medical conditions should be able to depend on hotel management to offer compliant food choices and to train their staff on the importance of food allergies. And if you say something is plant-based or gf on your menu, you better make sure it is. Don't play with your client's health.",2019-08-26T16:35:00Z,95

436,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"This review is specifically about the taxi stand at the JW Marriot Parq Vancouver. My husband and I stayed at the hotel for 6 nights and let me tell you those rooms aren't cheap! As a 5 star hotel the least they can do for their Marriott Bonvoy members is to hail us a taxi when we were leaving for the airport with suitcases! Instead the hotel staff directed us to the public taxi stand located at the P1 (parking) level. We stood in line for close to an hour with 2 suitcases waiting for a ride to the airport at 11pm along with a bunch of drunk party goers who were in the hotel on Saturday night.  There was a hotel employee whose job it is to ""supposedly"" manage the taxi line but all he did was watch as the line grew longer and longer. We travel a lot and  have never had such a terrible experience. I am giving the hotel a 2 star just for this. We ended up up dragging our bags at midnight all the way to the Canada line train station ten mins away at Yaletown-Roundhouse to get to the airport. Ridiculously low standard for a JW Marriott :(",2019-07-28T07:29:22Z,95
437,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"IMO, I think most of these reviews are for the casino and the locals disappointment with what they built. The hotel is new and the rooms and staff are amazing. They still are getting their house in order, finalizing some of the building and services still. That said the grounds are beautiful. The service is top notch. The casino is present. It's not Vegas. It's no Laughlin. But it is smoke free, clean, pretty and in the center of Vancouver. It is a great stay whether you choose to gamble or not. Not central downtown Vancouver, but if you're adventurous walking distance to everything. Can't speak to the restaurants as we didn't eat here but the executive lounge for rewards members is the best I've seen. The staff of Saru and Amin in that lounge are the most hospital and classiest people I've come across. We are here on vacation but I probably stay in 30 Marriotts per year for work and other various hotels. Many are great, few have ever necessitated my review.",2017-12-03T04:55:09Z,95
438,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"One of the best hotels I have ever been to for a conference! I'm sure we got a good rate for the room. 

Where do I start? I'm typing this review from the comfy bed. The pillows are perfect! I want to take them home with me! There are full size wash products in the marble washroom! And they all smell so good (makes me regret not budgeting enough to be able to enjoy the spa services). The coffee--yum! Creamy and delicious Illy coffee in sturdy ceramic cups. 

All staff we interacted with were courteous, professional, and helpful! My housekeeper thanked me for staying at the hotel, and housekeeping was immaculate.

The conference floor was great! The huge windows and open spaces were perfect. All the food was amazing. All the staff were exceptional. Maybe this says more about the usual types of places I go to! Lol. 

I am extremely pleased with my four night stay in this hotel. I didn't get to check out the casino but it looked nice, too. When I return to Vancouver, I will definitely consider staying here again.",2022-03-30T13:02:41Z,95

BOOM BOOM, All times of the day from early mornings until late evenings. My wife thought it was the cirq across the street firing some cannon, only to find out it was the gym above us. Ridiculous. JW Marriot if you see that someone has a crib request and you know they have a child, why stick them in the room below the gym? I have choice words for this place.",2023-11-23T15:03:32Z,95
440,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"While a vast majority of Marriott properties have a friendly staff, this hotel has probably the friendliest and most welcoming staff of any hotel we've ever stayed at. Just outstanding!

Just about everything about the hotel, room and executive lounge area was great. Our room was nicely appointed and looked up to date. We had several breakfasts and evening snacks in the executive lounge and the crew were very pleasant and the food was uniformly good. And we didn't lack for choices either. 

There were a couple issues that prevented me from giving the hotel 5 stars. The shower floor was extremely slippery and we asked for a shower mat. It never came. And for a portion of our stay, 2 and sometimes 3 of the 4 elevators weren't working. And finally, the PC's on both the executive lounge and the lobby weren't working.

442,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"I stayed at the JW Marriott Parq Vancouver for almost two weeks as part after I completed my 3 day mandatory quarantine at a federal government approved hotel.  I chose Parq Vancouver because I wanted to be as comfortable as possible if I was going to stay in a hotel without leaving my room for two weeks.  While it would have been more cost efficient to stay at a rental elsewhere, I knew I could count on a JW Marriott for high speed internet, clean rooms, luxury linens and great food.  (I had previously dined at Honey Salt)

Upon check-in, I was upgraded to a lovely room on a higher level with a million dollar view of False Creek.  Boy did those floor to ceiling windows really open up the space!  The linens of course, were fine and soft.  The walk in shower had a rain nozzle and the bathroom was open and spacious with a big sliding door.  

For almost two weeks, I did my exercise routine (HIIT or yoga), had video conference calls, streamed my favorite tv shows and enjoyed scrumptious meals daily from Honey Salt or the Victor.  I tried food delivery only once and didn't appreciate the almost cold food.  The cocktails from Honey Salt are yummy and I even enjoyed items from their Happy Hour menu in my room.  It was such a treat to dine on steaks (especially rib cap) from the Victor and they also have a nice wine selection.

I interacted with staff daily either through the Bonvoy app (so quick and amazing), over the phone to place my food orders, or from behind the door when they delivered my food.  The customer service was consistently excellent and courteous.  I will definitely be recommending the JW Parq Vancouver to any visiting family and friend.",2021-05-22T16:51:18Z,95

Pros:
+ Rooms are so clean! I'm super OCD and this place makes me feel at home, no need to  double check sheets and towels.
+ Hotel slippers!
+ Large and spacious rooms
+ Hugggge shower, love!!
+ Shampoo, conditioner, and lotions smell so good, and do not dry out the skin like other places. They're also using refillable bottles! Yay!
+ Front desk and bellhop were friendly and courteous, switched us to rooms on the same floor.
+ Valet was a breeze
+ CASINOOOOOO! But holy beans the drinks are not free (Read below)

Cons:
- None

Funniest part of our stay was probably the casino. A friend mentioned how it was the soberest casino he has ever been to. The two Ted's ordered a Blue Label and when the lady came by, she said 1-5-6. And all three of us turned around like...$156 or 1.56?? HAHA. No more drinks were ordered that night. And this also explains the soberness  of the casino.

446,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"Stayed here for a quick overnight trip to Vancouver after one of my coworkers told me to give it a try, and I can say without a doubt that I will be back! We were in town for the Canucks v Rangers game, and Rogers Arena is literally one block away (would also be perfect for any event at BC Place as it's even closer than Rogers!).

Our train arrived in Vancouver around 12:30pm, and they were able to accommodate us for early check-in upon arrival. We got a corner king-bed room on the 11th floor, which had rounded walls, amazing city views and natural lighting. The room was very clean and smelled fresh, with a complimentary espresso station in each room and individual bags of ice available on each floor. 

The Parq itself has a small casino and many dining choices (on the pricier side), including 24 hours room service and an option to pre-order breakfast the night before by placing your order on the door handle. It is an easy walk to/from BC Place/Rogers Arena, Chinatown (food!), Downtown (shopping!), Yaletown, etc. 

We received nothing but excellent customer service, from the roundabout, to the check-in area, to the concierge, to the luggage handlers. Very impressed, and will likely be our new go-to hotel when we are back in Vancouver!",2020-01-06T22:21:40Z,95

The room had a wonderful view of water and city. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was amazing, I loved the tub!

This hotel has a casino in it, which was completely unexpected. We don't gamble, so I can't speak to it. What I liked was not hearing the machines ring, I hardly knew the casino was there. 

The executive lounge was great. There were lots of food choices for breakfast and a great spread in the evening also. 

Everyone I met on the staff was friendly and helpful. From Helen and the concierge desk to Noah in the Salt&Honey bar. All the staff in the executive lounge were wonderful. 

P.S - if you like Whiskey, Noah introduced me to an amazing Japanese Whiskey, Nikka Coffey Malt Whiskey. It was a beautiful experience.

Update. Last night we had been out hopping on and off at sites, walking and soaking up Vancouver. We came back to the lounge for a quick bite before heading up to our room. Around 10 I received a call. Did you leave your purse in the lounge? ""No."" ""Hmmm,"" as I rustled around in my room. ""Yes."" We will bring it up to you.

452,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"I came back again after an awesome experience last time but booked my stay through an online travel agent instead of Marriott directly.  The experience sorta veered downwards.  While they were able to accommodate an earlier check in, upgrade (to a smaller and higher floor) and an 1 hour later checkout they missed the turndown service, when you turned on the heating it smelled funny (so I turned it off for the stay), there was a party going on in the large suite at the end of the hall with drunken people in the hallway trying to make their way to the elevator (I stayed away from the elevator) and they missed emailing out my folio.  This made me conflicted about the quality of this property so they do lose a star. 

I also tried the shuttle service from the skytrain station this time and it was super easy to find.  The route goes through the Chinatown area and it was nice to see the driver greet some of the regulars with a warm smile and a farewell with ""good luck""!

I checked out close to the usual checkout time we didn't have housekeeping staff interrupt us 3 times prior to a late checkout (and yes that was with the privacy sign up).  So I guess that was good?

Turndown service is quite a simple expectation for this level of property and with the smaller floor I'm just surprised how it could be missed.",2019-02-10T18:27:28Z,95

454,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"We had an unexpected 11 day stay at the JW Marriott during covid times and loved every minute of our stay.

The service levels at the JW Marriott were top notch.  Service is what separates this 5 star hotels from the other hotels in the Vancouver area.  All our requests were handled with aplomb by the JW Marriott Staff.

In particular, I would really like to thank Vincent who provided amazing service on check-in and throughout our stay and made sure we were looked after.

The rooms were particularly impressive.   The hotel was built in 2016, so the rooms still look relatively new.

We stayed in the studio suite, and the bathroom was just amazing with a big tub, and separate shower, and bathroom stalls.

The shower is big enough for two and featured a rain shower and Molton Brown soap, shampoo and conditioner in a bulk dispenser .

My wife and I were both working from the room for most of our stay, and found the space very functional, and well designed.

While the location is not in the heart of downtown, it is very convenient to BC Place/Rogers Arena, and also steps away from an excellent walking/running route along False Creek, and less than a 10 min walk to some great restaurants in Yaletown.

All in all, a true 5 star experience, and we hope to stay there again in the future during non-covid times.",2021-04-30T22:42:27Z,95
455,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"This is a great new hotel !

Located at the Parq casino, it's an excellent location with beautiful views. Perfect if you are attending an event at BC Place or Rodgers Arena. 

The suite we had was really nice. Very spacious, beautiful bathroom  featuring nice big soaker tub ( too bad the cold water tap was broke ) & separate frosted glass shower and washroom. 
They have full size Molton Brown bath & shower products to use ( they smelled terrific ) 

The bedroom had a floor to ceiling window that had a great water view. The bed was comfy, it had USB ports beside the bed, a big flatscreen TV on the wall, and a good sized wardrobe. 

The living room was huge! It had a REALLY 
long sofa in front of more floor to ceiling windows. It also had a few extra chairs and a small coffee table, a big screen TV with stereo speakers, a huge free standing mini bar, and large rounded pillars ( to go with the round shape of the room I guess ) 

The one side faced BC place, which looked so cool at night all lit up. The other side faced Science world.

The hotel itself has beautiful lighting fixtures throughout the hallways. You can access the casino from 3 floor ( high limit ) or 2 floor. You must show your key if you go these ways. The elevator is also key carded as well. 

So far the entire stay has been really great, and I would defiantly return and recommend.",2017-11-13T00:36:31Z,95

457,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"So, this is probably a 3 to 4 star property in my mind.  If I knew Vancouver better, I might rate it higher.  For me though, the room was smaller than I thought it would be, and the views were minimal.  Parking lots on one side, the arena on the other.... less than great.

The people are what make the hotel stand out.  In the concierge, they really go out of their way... everyone is 5 star.  Fresh juices, bakery, and even macarons made onsite.  Excellent.
In this environment, it is tough for anyone to stand out, but Rachael did.  I believe she's a transfer from a Korean Marriott, and English isn't yet mastered, but her attention to detail and everpresent smile stood out.  She really went over and above to help out, and on top of that, she hustled everywhere.

In the front desk area/concierge area, everyone went above and beyond as well.  Again, one person really stood out..... Irenya (sorry if I spelled it wrong) was outstanding.  Extremely friendly, and seemingly a problem solver, she really excelled.  Quick to respond, attentive, knowledgeable, and really friendly.... she definitely was someone I felt as if she truly had my interests on her mind.

These two were definitely two of the top employees I've met at Marriott properties.  Better than most people at the Ritz..... and no pretentiousness.",2019-07-12T06:02:13Z,95

Stayed for the night and had an okay experience here. Everything was great up until we got to our room. Right after getting off the elevator, I noticed that it smelled like weed. And once we got into our room the smell of smoke was stronger which I thought was really strange and wondered if it was coming from our next door neighbor. Whatever, I'm from Seattle, no big deal. 

20 minutes into settling in, the telephone starts ringing and my bf answers it and it's a hotel employee saying that someone walked by our room and smelled smoke coming out of it and that we are not not be smoking anywhere in the hotel. My bf told him that we weren't and that was that. 

BUT of course me being me, I wanted to get some clarification, so I called downstairs to let them know that our room already smelled of smoke/weed and the lady on the other end basically accused us for the scent and questioned me as to if it wasn't us then why didn't I call them right away so we could be moved into a different room - seriously?! Im not a fussy customer, I work in customer service and after 9 hrs of traveling and being on the go all I want to do is freshen up and relax for the rest of my day, not be inconvenienced! The lady then said that she would get in touch with who called us and let them know and that she would get back to me but of course that didn't happen. I had to inquire again on my own to make sure no additional charges were added to my room. 

We chose this hotel due to the fact that its new, modern, convenient location and that it has a few restaurants and a casino connected to it for added entertainment. Our room was nice and spacious enough for 2 people but because of the incident that happened when we arrived, which left a bad taste in my mouth (kind of made me feel like we were being watched) makes this just an okay hotel/experience for me.",2018-10-12T21:36:33Z,95
459,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"Gorgeous hotel with spectacular views. Oh and i didn't even know it was also attached to a casino!  That's a huge win (we'll actually it ended up not being). I pulled up in my rental car from a long road trip. The valet greeted me at the door and assisted with my luggage. As you walk through the door you definitely know you are in an upscale luxury hotel. 

Check in was quick and easy and I was off to my room. I was in the one bedroom king with the water view. Very nice size, amazing bathroom and a bed that I couldn't wait to sleep in. 

I had been in the car all day so I thought it would be a good idea to utilize the fitness center at the hotel. Again, stunning views of the city while you workout and better machines then most fitness centers you join and this place was big. Lots of machines from cardio machines to weight machines. About everything you could imagine. 

I already left a review on Honey and salt that is the bar on the first level. 

Only issue, around 10:30 I was going to order food because I realized I hadn't eaten, and twice I tried with no answer. Now normally that would bring my rating down a star but there were so many great things about staying here that if I could pick any hotel here again I would stay at the same place so I can't see dropping it.",2018-09-28T04:22:40Z,95

The in-room dining staff is quick, thoughtful and the food was very good, especially the pancakes! My only suggestion here is that the ""large"" pot of coffee is not large enough for two people to have more than one cup. Maybe a bigger ""large"" would be better? 

The front desk staff asked the reason for our visit upon check in, and we told them it was our wedding anniversary. The next day, they sent up a lovely dessert with their compliments and best wishes for a happy celebration. So thoughtful! 

The beds are so comfy, the bathrooms are wonderful (only suggestion here is that there is one towel hook and a tiny towel bar on the shower door, not large enough for a bath towel - so one is forced to put soiled towels on the floor, requiring washing when one might have reused the towel had their been another hook or a bar).

A lovely lobby area with access to casino one floor up and taxis, limos, etc., one floor down. There is a nice looking lobby bar. We did not avail ourselves of it. The staff is delightful - cheerful and accommodating. Concierge was helpful in planning our day adventures. 

Our room 1801, was ready at 9am after we arrived early from our ship and it was very nice. But, after we returned from our exploration of Vancouver we heard a constant background noise almost like a band playing or loud music. I was concerned about getting a decent night's sleep as we had a very early flight the next day. Two fellows came up to investigate and heard it too. They were unable to ascertain the source of the noise and the hotel moved us to another room 2301. This was nice and thoughtful. The new room was beautiful too bad we only were staying for one night. 

They have a really nice executive lounge which we took advantage of. Many choices for food and snacks.

467,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"Not a place I would ever recommend.

It's a 2 star hotel wrapped in a 5 star facade charging 5 star prices.

Many of the other guests staying here were aggressive, loud and smelled so strongly of weed that you could almost see a green haze around them.  It seems like the hotel to be, if you're trashy and like to act like you're a baller.

They charged me for parking on their parking inclusive package & made it seem like they were doing me a huge favor by taking it off the bill.

The bathroom stall is so small, that when you're sat on the throne, the glass door is literally an inch or so from your face.

There are no complimentary toiletries at all.  Even the shower gel, shampoo and conditioner are all bolted down.

The Slow basic, intermittent internet is also not complimentary.

The restaurant (Honey Salt) forgot 1/3 of our order and when I pointed this out to the server, she was very quick to blame the kitchen and then made a big fuss about doing us a huge favor by taking it off the bill.  Also, once the food arrived, good luck trying to get hold of the servers.  You're left on your own pretty much, until they decide to give you the bill.

The whole establishment seems like cash grab by presenting you a high end facade, but without any substance to backing up the high prices and snobby attitude.

The fact that they'd treat ordinary folk as poorly this, whilst allowing the trashier crowd to run around  like they own the place whilst smelling like weed, shows you their target audience.

It's a conference center, a Marriott hope and a Douglas hotel on the other side. The whole second floor is a massive casino and about three different sports bar type eateries and an Asian one as well. I will be reviewing one of those as well, so stay tuned. I booked this trip for a conference being held here for my job, and man I wish I had a couple more days to just relax and enjoy the downtown sites Vancouver has to offer. Anyway, I got up to my room on the 8th floor and was blown away once again at how amazing it was. The staff are all super super friendly and helpful as well. I explored the fitness center and got a run in, which happened to be on the 17th floor with immaculate views.

Overall great experience at the JW Marriot in Vancouver. 

Although the hotel is not located in the center of downtown, it is within walking distance to many things (ex. public library and Yaletown dining). 

Very pleasant experience checking in. Hotel staff is very cordial, friendly and helpful. We arrived early since our cruise ship arrived in Vancouver in the morning, and they were kind and quick enough (and we were also lucky they had a vacant room available) to let us check in early!! While checking in and before getting our room, we spoke to a concierge. She was very nice in helping us plan our days in Vancouver. The other concierge also chimed in to give some recommendations which were useful. The hotel provides free shuttles to two metro stations, and although we didn't use them I'm sure they've come in handy for many guests! 

The decor, from the moment you step into the lobby until your room, is sleek, clean and modern. It makes sense, considering the building was built in the last year. 

I had a guest room with two queen beds. Very comfortable beds and cozy sheets. Although didn't have a view of false creek, I had a decent view of downtown and BC place. Everything in the room was spotless! Few downsides: the bathroom setup- there's a sliding door that leads to the bathroom but the shower and toilet are separated by heavy glass. If you're not careful when closing the doors, they slam -- hard. Also, there were only two robes and slippers in the room when I specified in the reservation there would be three people staying in the room. Same goes with the nespresso, only two cups and one tea biscuit. These are some details that were probably only glossed over.

Note: I didn't visit any of the hotel's facilities. However, I did eat at the hotel in the lobby but I'll review it separately.

While the hotel is expensive, you get your money's worth. I would definitely recommend staying here, do not be worried that it's not in the center of downtown, downtown Vancouver is easily walkable!",2018-08-29T02:02:03Z,95
470,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"I had arrived an hour later than the 'supposed check in time (4pm)' and check in was fine. It was hard to hear because of the plexi glass because of COVID but the guy helping us just stepped to the side and apologized cause he knew everyone was having a hard time hearing. I requested online when i booked to have extra towels, firms pillows, and a room with a view. They accommodated every single item I have said. I got a view of science world as well as the water. 

Heading up to the 15th floor the hallways I must say are quite nice (haha). Yes, our room was very standard but it was very clean. Our bathroom had 2 separate doors; one for the toilet, and one for the shower. There was also a huge lounge sofa right by the window which was very nice. Love how they had netflix on the TV as they didn't have many channels to choose from on cable. 

Yes, I was hoping for a bit more luxurious room but I did my research and I knew what I was staying in. 

The location was perfect! If you knew how to get around downtown... robson was only a 15-20 min walk. 711 was a 5min walk. and cute cafes and restaurants were just a walk away!! Yaletown is close and so is QE and the public library. 

We checked out the roof top where the hot tub and gym, etc. were supposed to be. The outdoor part where the hot tub is was huge!! There were so many lounge areas and seating areas I was shocked! Plus the moment you look behind you, you are LITERALLY right beside Canada place... LITERALLY. the view is quite spectacular (because I haven't seen canada place that close before). We had tried to hot tub around 8pm and let me just say.. the hot tub wasn't even hot.. it was kinda hotter than a warm pool. AND the water was low... we had to sit at the bottom where your feet are suppose to be because if we sat at the designated sitting part our upper body would be freezing cold (late night in October). Lastly, there are no lights what so ever in the hot tub or anywhere near the hot tub.. so you can't see if anyone is inside. It was pitch black dark.. SO the hot tub experience was disappointing. 

My partner wanted some hot water and we normally just boil water in the coffee machine in other hotels but PARQ had an espresso machine so the water didn't come out as fast.. We called the front desk and they said that they will just give us a hot water kettle!! I was so surprised haha. 

The downside with COVID is that there are not many items inside the hotel room so you would have to request for certain items. We asked for extra blankets and 2 robes and they provided it fast and easy.

I envision Parq as an embodiment of Vancouver: breathtaking architecture and interiors, situated in Yaletown and False Creek - where I could go out, grab a craft beer before watching the Whitecaps.

+ Valet service. I know most hotels do this, but it was really nice since I was driving my car to just have the valet take it and bring it back for me when we were leaving.
+ Amazing customer service. The great thing about JW Marriotts across the board is that you know their service is going to be consistent. This one was no different. From the beginning when we checked in to check out when we got my car from the valet service, everyone was friendly and welcoming.
+ Comfy, comfy, comfy beds. It was like sleeping on a pillow. That is all that needs to be said. 
+ Equally comfy bathrobes, which felt like My body was getting hugged by a cloud. 
+ Their 24/7 gym. This isn't your ordinary hotel gym with just a few dumbbells and a treadmill. This gym has it all - squat rack, weight machines, cardio machines and more. I was impressed.
+ Their rooftop hot tub. I wish they had a pool instead of the small hot tub, but I'll take what I can get. It was beautiful to go up there at night and sit in a hot tub that overlooked downtown Vancouver. 
+ Location. It's about a 10 minute walk to Yaletown and a 15 minute walk from Chinatown. So location wise, it's central to a lot of cool restaurants and bars.

Stayed here on a weekend trip to Vancouver. With all the buzz of the hotel and casino, it was also a great opportunity to invite some family and friends over to experience the fun! 

Rooms - As hotels go, the decor and rooms itself are pretty modern and classy. It's still quite new and has that new hotel vibe. If there was one major complaint I had it's the bathroom; spacious-yes; but having a separate door for the toilet - and a door that slams if it's not shut properly- it a bit annoying. Bad design if you ask me.

The hotel itself is pretty nice, and the staff are all very friendly and helpful! Location-wise, you can only enter the driveway from one side of Pacific; very confusing and inconvenient. Parking is also expensive - ironically, if you just go to the casino to can get your parking validated. Too bad I learned that too late.

The views are gorgeous, the rooms are clean and modern as well as being well appointed. There are plenty of plugs, and even ceiling lights, something many hotels seem to lack. 

The valet parking is reasonably priced. The beds are very comfortable, the showers and associated products are all very good. 

So is it the best hotel? Definitely top five. So, yeah definitely deserving of five stars. It's incredibly quiet, the lifts are responsive. 

However, the one drawback is that you have to ask for showercaps. Ordinarily, this is fine - but in the late evening/early morning; the delivery staff may be a little slow. It's not enough to lose them a star, just something they should know about so they can work on.

482,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"We had a very lovely one week stay at this hotel. The location is perfect for attending events at Rogers Arena or BC Place and the proximity to the Cambie bridge made excursions outside of the downtown core super convenient as well. 

The service that we received was impeccable right across the board - the only issues we had involved the room, thus three stars instead of four or five.

We were staying in a one bedroom suite that was located in the southwest corner of the building. It was well appointed with the exception of one HUGE issue. There is barely any place to store your clothing outside of your suitcase! There was an armoire containing 6 hangers and that was it! The nightstands have no drawers, the desk has no drawers, the two drawers in the armoire contained the room safe and laundry items and the only other piece of furniture in the suite was packed with the mini bar. This oversight was mind-boggling to us and only partially remedied by a call to housekeeping with the request for 15 more hangers. We ended up keeping underwear etc. in a suitcase on a folding luggage rack that we kept in the corner of the bedroom. This was a pretty cheesy solution for a higher end hotel.

The view from the room was terrific - we had a panoramic view of False Creek from the Science Centre to Granville Island - the problem was that we had to keep our drapes drawn most of the daylight hours because the floor-to-ceiling windows turned our room into a terrarium and the room temperature would quickly go to 80+ degrees despite the AC being set to 70.  This happened when still in the winter months, I pity anyone staying in the room during the summer. 

If they re-configure the room they might be able to fit in a chest of drawers which would be excellent but the heat thing is a different type of problem which might not be as simple to solve.",2018-04-02T17:21:54Z,95

I like old school machines more. It was nice to have something open when everything else in town was closed. The hotel seemed clean but for the same price I rather stay at other hotels that I love in Vancouver .,2018-01-22T19:18:29Z,95
485,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"Well
It took over 30 minutes and four calls later to check in. 
So much for flawless check in.
We were there on a casino promo but NO ONE KNEW HOW TO HANDLE IT.
Rooms are new, high tech and calming.

No orientation re free internet, amenities, etc

Worst check in we have ever experienced!

We were supposed to be able to check out via our phones but no texts or links materialized.

When checking out NO ONE ASKED HOW WAS OUR STAY, nothing.

So many people working with such little knowledge.",2017-12-11T15:26:29Z,95
486,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,An outstanding level of service and very modern & cozy overall experience. The location and views are the best.,2018-09-21T18:47:18Z,95
487,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"Stayed here during my birthday. The staff really went above and beyond. Not only did they give me an upgrade to a suite, resort credit but also a complementary rollaway bed. The concierge lounge is also one of the best I've been to and I've tried many Marriotts/hiltons across the world. The whole place is so new and centrally located. Definitely recommend Honey Salt in the main lobby as well. Thanks for a lovely stay and a memorable bday =]",2018-01-05T19:55:15Z,95
488,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"This is probably the most upscale JW we have stayed at. The interior design is so on point to what's currently popular. While not grand in scale compared to the JW Desert Springs, it sets itself apart with luxury amenities, restaurants, whiskey lounge and a casino. Unfortunately, none of which I saw or used. I was fine going elsewhere in Yaletown to save a few dollars. And to be honest, it was almost too fancy, which attracts an obvious affluent and well dressed crowd. I could hang with them and be like them, but I'd rather not fake it and just go down the street to a pub. 

Restaurant aside, the rooms are where this place truly shines. Absolutely immaculate, large and spacious. First time we've ever requested feather free pillows in our room and they actually locked a room down for us with our request. That has NEVER happened in our 20+ years being part of the Marriott family. 

Staff was wonderful. Elevators were fast and efficient. And lots of places to walk to from the hotel. Though there is a ton of construction going on. 

Some of the negatives though, they put us right next to the elevator and you can not only hear people getting on and off the elevator with the *ding* of its arrival, but you can hear what I can only assume are the cables moving or hitting something every few seconds. I can see how this may drive some people nuts when trying to sleep. We put on some white noise to drown it out. 

And the worst part of this stay, not the fault of the hotel at all (I don't think) some random drunk dude tried to get into our room at 2:30am in the morning. I jumped out of bed ready to start swinging in case the front desk gave someone access by mistake, looked through the door and saw someone wondering why their key wasn't working, jiggling the door handle. I projected my deepest, and most annoyed alpha male voice I could muster up and said ""WRONG ROOM!"" and the guy quickly realized he was on the wrong floor. An apology would have been nice but he quickly went on his way. Again, hotel not at fault for drunken fools who forget their room number. Hell, I forget mine when I'm sober so I'm not that mad. 

Anyway, I can see us staying here again someday. Maybe this summer. Still want to try the whiskey lounge.",2018-03-06T17:07:33Z,95
489,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"I usually stay at the Westin Grand on Robson street when visiting Vancouver but decided to try this new property. I stayed here for 10 days in 2 different rooms. I almost canceled my reservation here on the day of our arrival due to some customer service issues but luckily KAI saved the day. Kai is one of the managers who really provided me not just good but outstanding customer service. The kind of customer service that you expect from real 5 star hotels. Not all 5 stars have 5 star customer service and very few of them get perfect score in my book but KAI really is a good ambassador or what the hotel should strive for in terms of customer service across the board. My overall experience was pretty good but I cant give it a full 5 star yet. You expect more from a 5 star property and I feel that my review provides appropriate expectations to a hotel of this caliber. My last 5 star rating was the peninsula hotels. Because I have traveled the world and have seen so many properties, it is very seldom that I get impressed. I was impressed with this one. The location is pretty good. You are still walking distance from a lot of places yet tucked in Yaletown away from the noise, the crowds and all the downtown hustle and bustle. I kinda like this location very much. The hotel is right beside BC place and I was there when there was a rock concert one night and I have to say it was pretty loud and you really can hear it from your room (1537). I don't know if facing the water would make a difference.

The cleaning folks are pretty outstanding. The quality of care and cleaning they do on a daily basis is truly impeccable, you don't see this in most hotels especially in North America. Most notable is Joy (Johayra) who really took the time and effort to address my needs and special requests. They remind me of the quality of cleaning you get from luxury hotels in Asia which is very thorough and detailed. I also have to point out how the cleaning crew are very considerate with the level of noise they make when they are working so as not to disturb guests. The club room is very impressive. Ive been to other club rooms and vip lounges and this one puts most of them to shame. From the food they serve during breakfast to the snacks that are available all day. If all lounges are like this, I wouldn't mind paying for membership to be able to get in.

The spa/fitness floor is a WOW! My husband is a personal trainer and we have been to hundreds of hotels around the world and he said that this might be the best he has seen. Everything you ever need! Even those who are not into working out might be motivated to do so when you see the gym. The outdoor part has an outdoor lounge area and a hot tub with lots of sun beds. I was able to enjoy hours of sunbathing in this space. So peaceful, tranquil and just a perfect setting to lay back relax and enjoy the rare days of sun in Vancouver. The design and aesthetics of the hotel is warm, light, neutral colors which appeals to a lot of people. Everything was just done with such refined taste level. You just have this zen feeling the moment you step out of the elevators and open your room. The room is beautiful. Functional, comfortable, modern but very warm and inviting with perfect lighting.  1902 is facing false creek, gorgeous views, king bed. I love this room because it is not adjacent to any other room so the noise possibility is minimized. 1537 with 2 double queen beds is facing BC place and the park. The view is still nice but I like the water view better. If you read my hotel reviews, there is one common thread in all of them... how quiet are the rooms? This hotel passed my test with flying colors. I barely heard any noise from adjacent or above rooms or from outside. Whats really good is the fact that you don't hear loud slamming doors that you encounter in most hotels. Both rooms don't have tubs, I think there are only a few rooms with a tub and it comes with a premium price.

I was able to put the service of this hotel to test and I have to say for the most part the service here is very good. Patrick was very helpful from the front desk. Sara from the concierge really takes the time to understand your needs and make appropriate recommendations.

Why not a perfect 5 stars? The lobby is a bit low key, there is really nowhere there to sit, lounge and hangout. There are service inconsistencies. When I asked for a let check out, they told me 1230 is all they can do but when I checked out downstairs it was mentioned to me that 1 pm would be acceptable. I would think that for someone who stayed there for 10 days they would give me a break especially when the hotel was not busy that day (I checked).

My new favorite hotel in Vancouver! I recommend and I will be a return guest.",2019-09-10T01:24:04Z,95
490,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"I had an amaaazing time here. The hotel is clean, modern, and the location is great. I wasn't too impressed with breakfast, but the small offerings in the evening were top notch. great non alcoholic drink selections ( fresh pressed juice, non dairy alternative milks, sparkling water on TAP!). they had amazing buttermilk fried chicken the first night, and second night was short ribs! we spent over 200 dollars for an early dinner at a restaurant in yaletown, and was much happier with the food in the lounge!!  anyway, this will definitely be my new go to hotel in when in van",2020-02-07T23:31:08Z,95
491,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"Came here for a long weekend work trip. The staff was extremely friendly. Our room had a nice view of the river. On one of the nights I needed a tie and forgot one so I called downstairs and the concierge was awesome and brought up two different options for me to use. They were extremely helpful for that. They also helped set up some lunch reservations and tours for us so we didn't have to worry about it. Walked around the casino, but didn't have a chance to play any of the games.",2019-07-07T17:01:38Z,95

As if this wasn't bad enough, safe was also not reset and thus wasn't available to use. Definitely not 5-star hotel worthy and absolutely not returning. They should be honest and just admit that this is in fact a 3-star hotel at best.

Update. Although it took a little while, at least the staff was able to handle the situation and move us to a room that had internet working properly.",2019-08-31T14:29:18Z,95

Ent!

Our company held a sales and customer meeting here this week. I was a member of the staff. 

The event staff knew what we wanted before we did. 
If I could stand on the highest mountain and shout, ""I adore the JW Marriott Parq Vancouver!!!"" I would! 

I'm happy to be heading home after our successful event, but I don't want to leave. 

For anyone in a customer service role, visit this hotel. They'll show you how it's done.

Everyone in the hotel will do anything asked, even if it's not their job and they have no idea how to do it. 

Too many names to list here. This is one BIG THANK YOU! 

Best event experience ever!

502,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"This is one of the newest JW's I've stayed at and the quality of the rooms and finished didn't disappoint. It's a little odd to have a casino on the second floor, but it was pouring one night so we checked it out and found it to be nice and new. Even the self parking garage is spacious, well lit, and brand new. 

The staff in the executive lounge are amazing, seriously some of the best service I've ever received in a Marriott lounge. The drinks were very well made, the plates were cleared as though we were at a 5 star restaurant. 

The suites are very nicely appointed, though I would recommend a Mountain View over the water view. In either case, we didn't see mountains or much water from this location but I preferred the layout of the Mountain View. You'll love the Molton Brown toiletry products, they smell wonderful and are some of the nicest products in a JW. 

The biggest disappointment, and reason for lacking 5 stars, was the apparent lack of recognition for loyalty status. I'm a titanium elite (over 200 nights in a Marriott last year) and have high floor in my profile, yet we were near the bottom. The rooms are obviously the same on every floor, but we were hoping for a higher floor with a better view. The adjoining Douglas hotel is shorter and on higher floors in the JW, you can look directly over the Douglas. 

Overall, a very nice property. We will likely return, and hopefully next time we'll have a better view.",2019-03-08T17:01:39Z,95
503,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,Rooms are nice and modernized.  Pillows are more like concrete blocks.  Shower is nice but pressures low. The handle wouldn't stay at a level and I had to place a cardboard.  The staff charged me for internet even though they said it would be waived if we signed up for the membership.  They did remove the charge after I this to their attention.  Staff slow with dining service.  Casino is a negative attraction in my opinion.  We were roomed in worse room by elevator keeping us up whole night.  They did move us afternwe complained but that took a good 3-4 hours.  Location is good.,2019-02-24T20:53:10Z,95
504,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"An unabashed cash grab on every level.  Never have I stayed in a hotel that skimped on so much and yet tried to squeeze any possible dollar out of their guests.  For example, charging $15 for wifi.   No complimentary water.  No complimentary bathroom products--in fact the soap and shampoo bottles were bolted down.  Pure class.  A $4 fee for room service with an automatic %18 gratuity they don't mention.  In fact, there were so many taxes on our $537/night room the front desk couldn't even explain what the Room MRDT was beyond ""it's a tax.""  The room was clean, small, with zero water pressure in the shower and a leaky stall.  This is what a $500 room gets you.  Then there's the casino.  $9.20 for a bottle of beer.  In the ""nightclub"" (which has no dance floor) you'll pay $14 for a draft beer.  Expect wilted lettuce in your salad, and warm glasses of water at HoneySalt if you dine there.  For a casino with no charm or character and limited gaming (One craps table that was 5 deep on a Saturday night) perhaps one could expect good service.  The servers in the casino were like unicorns--if they existed I never saw one.
For one night in this mind numbing monstrosity you could spend a weekend in Vegas.  Don't waste your money here!",2017-11-27T01:33:13Z,95
505,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,This place is perfect. It's very very expensive but if you are coming to Vancouver then expect to pay.

507,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"Disappointing stay. First the good things Nice room comfortable bed, great view (Room 1605).

A few days before we arrived I had explained to the front desk that we are celebrating our anniversary. Wanted to give them a heads up as some hotels will do something a little more special. When we arrived I told the front staff that again it was our anniversary and still no response or acknowledgment. I had specifically asked for a room that was not joining another room as adjoining doors usually let in lots of noise. They said no problem. We dropped our bag off and went for a walk as the rooms were not available yet. When we got the call to come back we stopped by the front desk grabbed the key and went up to our room. Like I said earlier great view and then noticed the room had an adjoining room and we could easily here the TV in the next room. I called down to the front desk to ask what happened as they stated they would not place us in a room with an adjoining door. Their only solution was to move us from 1605 to the 11th floor into a double queen room with no view. Very frustrating, I told them we would live with the room. Sure enough the guests next door like to watch TV till late so it took a while to actually fall asleep but then I woke up at 3am to their TV. My wife is asleep and did not want to wake her up to call the front desk to have them contact our neighbours to ask them to turn down their TV. It's now 4am as I write this review. No acknowledgement of our Anniversary from the hotel nor their restaurant Victor was definitely disappointing and the adjoining door even more disappointing as I am wide awake at 4am",2020-08-30T10:57:53Z,95
508,JW Marriott Parq Vancouver,4.0,"The rooms are great, right up until you figure out that you can hear everything the person in the next room says. This has to be this thinnest walls of any hotel I've ever been to. Add in that our neighbors were having a party in the middle of the night and it gets worse. About 70 f bombs and more than a few suggestions that they get naked before we called security who was effective for the 1 minute they were there. This place is too expensive to be dealing with this. Not what you'd expect from a truly high end hotel.",2019-03-30T07:46:14Z,95

The location is very clean and close to the water which is great for runners and peaceful walks. The hotel is less than a year old and felt very new. The highlight of our stay was the staff. Rudolfo, Charles, Natalia, Mario, Helen and the whole concierge team helped us with every detail, meal and day excursions of our trip.

Our check in seemed fine, but as the night continued around 11:30-11:45 pm the night time manager knocked on our door and told us we had to leave. He then escorted us downstairs, which was not necessary and very unprofessional. When asked why we needed to leave, he told us we had to many guests in our room, which was not true. When I showed him my confirmation email, which had stated we had reserved the room for 4 guests, he then said we never registered everyone. I told him when I checked in, the clerk asked me for only my ID (even though there were other people with me) and didn't mention anything about registering the others. When I explained that to the night time manager, he then said there was a glitch in the system. He never apologized. He then said that it was a noise complaint and that's why he came upstairs. (Which was a completely different reason from the initial complaint). I told him that we should of received a warning before going and 'kicking' us out of our room.  

We were very embarrassed and this encounter had ruined our night. We were celebrating a friend's bachlorette party and we're just trying to make it special for her, which in then end ruined her night.",2019-04-03T01:36:34Z,95

We also enjoy eating at the Arc restaurant in the hotel. Breakfast is free there with your room. It's super simple to go on a cruise as they will deliver your bags to the ship and you can just go walk across and board the ship.

It was super luxurious with access to exclusive private Gold Lounge, personalized VIP concierge services and complimentary breakfast, snacks throughout the day, evening canapes and dessert. Various beverages (tea, espresso coffee, juices, ales, hard liquor) were available to choose from at any hour of the day. The roof top provided some of the best views Vancouver has to offer. The gym had all essential equipment to provide a full body workout with relaxing pool and city views. Definitely enjoyed the hot tub too!

523,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"If you need to park at the hotel, head straight over to Burrard St and turn towards the water. Address is approx 200 Burrard St. From there, head down to either P2 or P3 and follow the signs for hotel parking. There should be an elevator bank near that section in the corner to take you up to the lobby.

The hotel is very busy. One of the few places since I've travelled in the past year after the loosening of covid restrictions where I have to constantly wait in line. Waiting in line for the check-in counter, waiting in line for the elevator, waiting for a space in the jacuzzi pool. Waiting seems to be the common theme here.

It has a fairly convenient location, right on the water and close to the Waterfront translink station. The staff were curteous and helpful, five stars.

I really didn't like the beds though. The mattress seems two sizes too small. I'm not really sure what happened here, but you can clearly see the box/spring underneath. Not very appealing aesthetically. Also not a big fan of the frame sticking out from under the mattress, different from other hotels and habit of walking closer to the mattress made me bump into the frame a few times. Especially with smaller kids around who can sometimes be more careless than me! Also the shower can definitely use a bit more water pressure.

Overall it's not a bad hotel, but I just expected more from a Fairmont given the price point and brand.",2022-11-30T15:37:03Z,143
524,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Absolutely ruined my brother's 50th birthday and Christmas!!!

I've tried everything to reserve my brother's birthday on my Canadian Visa Card. Turns out I can't use it as a credit card because it is a Virtual Visa Debit which they can not accept. Why didn't you tell me a few days ago when I sent it to you?? 

 This completely rude manager named Michael Zhuang accused me of fraud. 

The reason why I don't want to use my American money is my business because I have Canadian funds in Canada to use! I am not a fraud!

Shame on you for not resolving this issue and making these accusations! You didn't even try to use my Amex but labeled me which is discriminatory!

My poor brother is there ready to celebrate and you ruined his birthday and Christmas. 

Never will stay at the Fairmont Waterfront it's been a disaster. 

Fast forward Mena Naji called me back and confirmed they wouldn't have been able to process my credit card on the same day with a bunch of excuses pertaining to internal policies and procedures which sounds like a bunch of nonsense. Bottom line you don't have a great way of taking credit cards on line to accommodate. Will not take accountability nor conflict resolution strategy. Big thumbs down.",2022-12-23T20:43:06Z,143
525,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"The Fairmont Waterfront is located across the street from the Pan Pacific Hotel with it's large white iconic sails at the waterfront aka Vancouver Harbour.

This Fairmont as opposed to the very chic ultra luxurious Fairmont Pan Pacific (a block away) or the older but elegant, Fairmont Hotel Vancouver (across from the Vancouver Art Gallery), has many things going for it!

Rooms are swanky & comfy, excellent location for sightseeing & quick access point to waterfront or downtown, ARC restaurant, heated pool & hottub, friendly warm staff & Miku restaurant across the street.

Having stayed at the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel last summer, I've come to fall in love with the Fairmont brand.

Fairmont Waterfront is luxurious & although many prefer the Fairmont Pacific Rim (you'll be needing the Black Card to stay there), I recommend you stay here & save that money for the fabulous weekend brunch buffet!

See my ARC review for pix! 

A large spectacular rooftop heated pool, hottub & gym make this hotel a great place to stay!

Being at the waterfront means quick access to the seabus if you want to go over to the North Shore.

This location is great for walkers or joggers - Coal Harbour area & Stanley Park minutes away & a comfortable 15min walk over to Robson Street.

Historic Gastown is an easy 5min walk over & you're on Water Street.

If you fly into Vancouver, you can take the Canada Line train from YVR Airport straight to downtown waterfront, then wheel your luggage over - 5mins from Waterfront Station to the hotel.

Easy!

Yelpies don't hesitate to book a stay here!!!

But if you do go with Fairmont Pacific Rim, I won't be mad at ya ... I'll be jealous!",2022-01-12T06:08:04Z,143
526,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Staying at a Fairmont your expectations will always be met or exceeded. There were at least three other Fairmont locations nearby but love love this location. Central to downtown Vancouver and all the great eateries, Stanley Park, Granville Island, and so much more to explore, it was a perfect place to escape and explore Canada's winter. 

Service is impeccable here. You'll always be treated well. Note, there is no valet but if you park at Easy Park parcade across the Waterfront Centre, it's affordable and convenient. Our room 2324 offered the perfect view of the skyline and Stanley Park. The fitness and pool area is immaculate and offers great amenities so you can stay on track of fitness goals while vacationing. 

Dining at ARC is wonderful and suggest reservations during your stay. If you forego the in room coffee, plenty of coffee shops and Starbucks located nearby. Note, if you move anything in the minibar, the sensors will think you partaked. So be careful of potential charges however, the hotel will adjust any incorrect charges willingly and kindly. 

Travel is an investment in yourself. The goal is to collect memories and not just dreams. You only live once. But if you do it right, once is enough. So book a room here and go explore!",2022-01-03T15:54:38Z,143
527,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"You always know the kind of treatment you'll get at a Fairmont. Clean, professional, and often times in unique locations with a history and a story to tell.

I recently stayed here on a short trip for business. The room was extremely well appointed, great selection of in room food and drink as well as an excellent restaurant called arc. Surprisingly one of the best meals you can get at Arc is there a grilled cheese and tomato bisque.  It was probably cooked using over a pound of butter but I didn't care! Excellent.

One gripe I had, don't think it is the fault of the hotel, rather the current labour market-- is it appeared that some services fell short of regular standards due to a shortage of staff. I was lucky enough to be there with my fiancé and was disappointed when we're informed by the front desk they were unable to deliver a bottle of Prosecco around 11:30 PM.

Really excellent pool, hot tub, and fitness facility here.  Each bathroom has a eucalyptus steam room (closed for COVID).  

Overall, would recommend.  Vancouver has many Fairmont's and they are all excellent and unique in their own way.",2022-01-02T23:42:36Z,143
528,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"We have stayed at other Fairmonts in the past so we had high expectations, so this experience unfortunately fell a bit short for us. 

Pros:
- Comfortable bed, firm(ish) mattress
- Friendly service from the concierge, bellhops, and doormen
- Good amenities at the health club (plenty of towels, slippers (if you get there early), hair dryer, nail care, combs, body lotion, shave kit, tampons/pads, hair spray)

Cons:
- The rooms are a bit dated and need some updating - there is quite a bit of wear and tear on the countertops and carpet. 
- The room walls are very thin, we could hear everything in the hallway and the rooms next to us and above us (conversations, taking showers, running, etc.) 
- There were some cleanliness issues with our room (cobwebs on the ceiling) 
- Large standup shower however, it was equipped with a small rain shower head that did not provide adequate coverage
- The hot tub area needs some major updating - the film on the windows were peeling and chipped tiles. The overall ambiance of the hot tub area isn't very relaxing. 
- The steam rooms need some major updating - the tiles are chipping, there seemed to be some growth on the tile, strange smell, and it would take at least 10 minutes for the steam cycle to start-up. The start-up of the steam cycle was also very noisy and clunky. 
- Replenishment of the health club flavoured water sat empty from the afternoon until the end of the night (we went around 4pm and again at 9pm). 
- Very long queue for the elevators during check-out. We waited for 10 minutes as several elevators full of people opened and closed. Luckily, one of the workers on the floor noticed this and graciously offered to take us via the service elevator instead. THANK YOU",2023-01-09T23:34:36Z,143

Only brunch was good. 
So many issues with this place once i left. 

They said they would honor my Amex travel deal but they never did, charged me for something that i should haven't been. 

The pool was a mess with first come first serve with tons of kids jumping and splashing pool water in your wine glasses. Pool bartender needed so much help it took over 45 mins every time there was a drink needed.

The room was ok not an upgrade as they said, very outdated. The other fairmont was much much nicer.",2021-08-31T23:39:25Z,143

The staff was very professional and kind. We were treated to high-end coffee, canapés, desserts, beverages, breakfast, and much more. Our room was on the 8th floor and the views of the water were spectacular. We especially enjoyed watching the sun come up over the water in the mornings. This hotel is very close to Stanley Park and within walking distance of so many restaurants and downtown sights. This hotel also has a heated pool and jacuzzi which were clean and had great views.

533,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"As American Express card holders my husband and I like to stay at their ""Fine Hotels"" if we can. The added perks really make it worth it. We stayed at The Fairmont in Hawaii and really enjoyed it so we wanted to give it a shot in Canada.

Walking in is so grandeur. The place is magnificent. The front desk was so nice and helpful during our Check-In process. We were upgraded to a BEAUTIFUL corner room with windows galore! 

I also enjoy the small touches here. Like the flavored waters and teas in the lobby. They had this in the Hawaii one as well. Very nice because I am always thirsty.

We used the Concierge here often. They helped us find great food options, and told us many different things we could do in the city during our stay. They even helped us gat a cab SINCE THERES NO UBER IN CANADA! What!! I don't remember the last time I took a Taxi! Haha

We ended up using our $100 dining credit to have the one of the most memorable dinners together at the Arc restaurant. The food there is DEFINITELY worth the price! 

We had a fantastic time here and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Vancouver. You are close to just about everything!",2020-01-25T14:52:38Z,143
534,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Was in town for an overnight stay, this hotel was very convenient for us as we would be right across the way at Canada Place. We got there early before normal check-in time, unfortunately they didn't have our room ready just yet but could upgrade us to fancier room with view and all this other stuff....appreciate it but nah, we can wait. They will text you when your room is ready. Bellman was super helpful with holding your luggage until you check-in.

We walked around downtown, went to lunch, did some shopping, the hotel texted us earlier than we thought so since we were out & about, we didn't even check-in until late afternoon/early evening. Our luggage was already delivered to our room, what a bunch of sweethearts! After officially checking-in, we headed to the pool, it's a nice looking view, ok amount of chairs, it was pretty crowded up there and skin everywhere. We didn't check out the garden and bee farm, we didn't realize there was one until later. 

The room is nice, king sized bed for all kinds of activities, very comfy, nice soft sheets, plenty of room, nice big TV, great view, above average bathroom and shower was nice, no issues with the room and I sawed some logs when I fell asleep, didn't hear any hallway noise or any other amorous neighboring tourist next door. 

WiFi isn't free, but once you are connected, you are good to go. The hotel has a complimentary fancy car to give you a ride, but their radius is a little limited and we couldn't get a ride to the train station the next morning.

535,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"We actually stayed here the September pre-COVID before our Alaska cruise.  It cost a bit more (I did book using points), but our whole family (4 rooms total) enjoyed it. It's a nice hotel, very clean and things felt new.  Our kids enjoyed the pool quiet a bit, and there was plenty of seating area for the adults who didn't swim.  The little cafe downstairs had good food if we didn't want to venture far, or if we wanted to walk a bit we were able to get to things easily.

The bar downstairs was actually awesome so our kids could stay together in one of the rooms to hang out, and the adults were just downstairs for drinks and music.  The bar was also decently full, but you could find a seat (again, pre-COVID) so I found it to be a fun environment. 

On the day we boarded our cruise ship, it was raining just a tad, but it was very easy for each person (grandparents down to kids 7 and up) to roll our own suitcases on the short walk over to the port to get checked in.  If I'm cruising out of Vancouver again, I'd look into staying here again.",2021-04-13T18:46:59Z,143
536,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"I was greeted by a very swell gentleman who helped check me in when the other two ladies were a bit occupied. He gave me a very warm feeling welcoming me into Fairmont, even though I must look like a mess just waking up from a sleep during a short tour from Squamish earlier. 

My room was on fifth floor and the view was stunning. I was almost as high as the red ship yard crane from a distance. Throughout the stay I just let myself immerse into the city night sky and did not draw the thick curtain. I was afraid that I would not see it again after tomorrow. The room was wide and spacious, everything was well design and integrated into a lovely experience. The sockets and plugs were hidden at the end of the desk, it was an interesting find. The TV was the right size in front of the viewing angle when you lied down in bed.

I did wish I got a bathtub but a shower instead. Still, the adequately wide shower head above killed all my tiredness and refreshing. The bed was quite high due to layers. Because of these layers, the bed was made for a king, superb comforting. 

Express check-in and check-out online were available, suited me catch up with sky train in a hurry when time flew. 

I managed to go to the 3rd floor for a quick swim in the next morning. Pool was warm and the Jacuzzi had my love. Fun experience.",2021-10-31T08:09:31Z,143

Super comfortable bed and bedding, raindrop shower and an amazing view. The location right in the heart of the downtown waterfront is ideal for being within walking (or biking) distance from Stanley Park, Gas Town, Chinatown, Canada Place and wonderful shopping and eating destinations.

The staff was discreet and unobtrusive. I felt like I moved in and belonged there. Our room was spotless and little unseen fairies came and did an evening turn down service while we were out exploring each day.

We were part of a large group but felt like we got individual attention. The catered meals in the banquet room were delicious. Great experience with the waitstaff. We especially loved the tea and pastry selection offered.",2019-07-10T20:42:54Z,143

It's conveniently located across from the Convention Center Downtown, and some rooms have water views. 

It's always super clean, and rooms well lit. Rooms have plush robes and nice Rose 31 toiletries. They also have a mini bar which certainly can come in handy ! 

The beds are very comfy ( as in all the Fairmount's I've stayed at ). The staff is always pleasant to deal with. 

You do need a keycard to access the floors in the evenings ( In case you are expecting a guest, call down to leave them a room key at the front desk )",2018-01-23T05:00:15Z,143

The lobby welcomes you with several types of water flavored with citrus fruits and other ingredients. It is a thoughtful way to greet guests especially after travelling to get there.

541,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"If you're conflicted with where to stay in Downtown Vancouver... look no further.

Do you remember those special hotel stays you'll never forget? Well, imagine how good it must be if you're there only one night!

I had the pleasure of staying at the Fairmont Waterfront with my father for just one night before a cruise. 

Some might pick this hotel solely based on it's location to the cruise port. It is directly across the street. 

But the Fairmont Waterfront excels beyond other Five Star hotels in the city because of its people, accommodations and impeccable service standards.

When I stay at any Fairmont, I always get the Gold Level room. This is like a small hotel inside a hotel.

Our room wasn't quite ready, so we relaxed in the Fairmont Gold lounge. They have a gorgeous setup throughout the day. Breakfast, canapés and a dessert bar. 

The lounge here is on the smaller side, but they have a stunning outdoor patio that overlooks the cruise port and downtown.

The also have an honor bar so this is the perfect place to enjoy a cocktail and a small bite.

Rooms are beautiful and include any luxury amenity you can imagine. Their beds are sumptuous and the hotel has a nice turn down service, which is long gone from other hotels.

If you're cruising, the hotel will come and take your bags and they magically appear at your door on the ship. This is complementary and a luxury worth the stay.

So, what made my stay so special? 

When you have a Gold level room, you also have a dedicated Gold level team that will craft your stay while here.

I had the pleasure of interacting with Risa and Malia. Wow... they will make anything happen. Always with a smile and laser focused on every detail. 

Fairmont and their employees are the reason I wouldn't stay anywhere else when I have the option.

I can't say enough about how they deliver.",2019-09-28T22:34:17Z,143

If service is this good, I wonder what it's like with Fairmont Gold? ;)

If you have a happier and connect with people here, you won't feel anything wrong or not satisfied during vacation, the best experience was the guy housekeeper worked 9 pm he came to give me water bottles, slippers and toothbrush, and in-dining room waiter is so friendly and nice.

545,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Reading the other reviews, I was prepared to love my stay at the Fairmont Waterfront, but I did not. I stayed here because it's right across the street from the cruise terminal. Off the ship at 7:30am I knew my room wouldn't be ready, so I checked my bags and stopped at the desk to ask them to let me know when my room was available. They said they would text me. 

Then over to the concierge desk to see if I could get a tour of some kind to pass the time. They said they make some phone calls to see what was available. 

So I went to the restaurant for breakfast, which was pricy but ok. Then back to the concierge desk, and they hadn't gotten around to checking for me. I said I'd sit in the lobby for a while. After an hour, back to concierge and they still hadn't called. So I stood there and they finally called and found out the tours I was interested in were sold out. I did book a Harbor cruise, but the hotel valet parking desk said no transportation was available, but they could call me a cab.

So now I'm into big money for a tour I wasn't that interested in. I later found out there was a shuttle I could have taken that had a stop a half block away, but neither the concierge or parking guy never mentioned it.

So with one thing and another I frittered away the day, checking for texts to see if my room was ready. No texts. Finally I got back to the hotel about 5:30, and the front desk told me, ""oh, your room became available while you were having breakfast. We thought you knew."" Silly me, I guess.

So check at the bell station and no they hadn't taken my bags to my room. Silly me, I guess. So get into my room, finally, and there's water and snacks available for purchase and there's a charge for wi-fi, Jeez, at a holiday inn express I get free bottled water and wi-fi. But at a four star hotel, nothing's free. Silly me, I guess.

Finally, next morning I get charged the cost of a steak dinner for a buffet breakfast! And when I ask for a shuttle to the air port, I'm told there is none, but they will call me a cab. Jeez, at the Wyndham I stayed at when I started the cruise, they had a shuttle that had stops at the airport and a few downtown locations. But at a four star hotel, nope. Silly me, I guess.

So in summary, I thought this hotel was expensive and terrible. I'll be returning to Vancouver for future cruises, but I'll definitely be looking for a different hotel.",2018-05-28T18:07:53Z,143

The hotel has a reputation for excellent service and they delivered. I also received great sightseeing tips from the Concierge prior arriving on our first trip to Vancouver which we planned at the spur of the moment.

Although the location is convenient to much in the city including Stanley park, Capillano shuttle, a block from the train station, Gastown, and a half hour walk from Granville Market. The hotel is located on a busy corner right across from Canada place with lots of traffic and exhaust you can smell from busses and traffic when sitting on the Gold lounge deck or 3rd floor outdoor pool deck-so much for breathing fresh air.  I was so excited the gold lounge had an outdoor deck, but it did not have the charm as some of the other Fairmont waterfront properties like the Empress.  Once I got over that, I enjoyed it for what it was. We also stayed in the Waterfront side which was a bit noisy with a generator type noise, maybe due to being near the underground train.

Join the Fairmont Presidents Club which is free and have access to bikes which can be taken out to ride around Stanley Park etc.

550,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"This is probably THE best hotel stay I've experienced in my whole life. The fact that it's in Vancouver is an ""unfair"" advantage because I'm so impressed by Canadian hospitality. I was here for a week attending a conference at the convention center. This downtown area is central to many great restaurants, bars, and tourist adventures. This area of Vancouver is generally small, to the point where I walked miles to Stanley Park and back one day.

Anyways, back to the hotel. The Fairmont is such a fantastic, high-class brand. The rooms are clean and modern... part of me wanted to lay in bed all day and NOT go to the event. But there was so much to see around Vancouver, I couldn't waste the precious week I was here. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to experience the pool area... I need to make it a habit to bring my swim suit with me on every trip. I did, however, hang out at The Arc, which is the hotel bar and restaurant. Delicious food and drinks, which I'll rave about in a separate review.

While I'm not part of the Fairmont Presidents Club, I read about some great perks of that membership. Someday I'll be fancy enough to join. There's a special lounge and everything. Regardless, the superb service extends to all its guests, not just VIPs. Well I suppose you could say they make everyone feel like a VIP. It's always nice to get tired from attending an event or sightseeing, then look forward to coming back to the hotel, not just for the comfy bed, but for the classy community it fosters.",2017-11-19T16:00:45Z,143

The food was REALLY REALLY good. Loved the chana masala, great desserts. I was especially happy there were a lot of vegetarian options, but overall I thought the menu could be bigger. Especially the kids' menu. The veggie burgers were really good, but that was really the only thing my son would eat.

554,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Dear Mr. Flores

We just came down from staying at Fairmont Chatue/Whistler which was unbelievable with customer service and extremely pleasant wonderful experience. 

We are a family of 3 young kids plus my mother, (6 total) we were so happy and loving Canada until we arrived here at Fairmont WaterFront.

The lady at check in was pleasant her name was Victoria and it said trainee on her badge. She obviously was new and inexperienced. We were checking in at 6:15 pm.

I asked if there were any upgrades available and she said let  me check. After 25 min of waiting patiently her colleuge a young gentlemen tried to help her. ( they kept saying thank you for your patience as they realized it was taking a very long time)

They said we have the same room available just higher better views with breakfast and executive lounge access for $70/CAD/night. 

He then said "" it's the same room just with better views of the Port and Breakfast"" so I said sure why not better views of Port for my kids.

Now this is 45min into check in....I went up to room 803 which was on the elevator and the doors closed....then they said you have 802 and we will open door. Another 20 min wait with little kids. 

Then the housekeeper tells me no you have just double double beds with couch area. 

I go back downstairs this is now an hour into. Check in.

I ask to speak to GM. I see the young gentleman disappear into a room where the older man is just sitting. Another 10 min wait while I'm standing in the lobby. 

Then he comes out Craig Smith....without any apologies he proceeded to tell me they explained the diff room that it was different and no king room. And if I want a king bed then I should pay for another room. ( I assure you at check in they said same rooms just better views)  His tone of  voice was pompous, arrogant, belligerent and unapologetic at all. I am in tears this has been the WORSE check in I've ever experienced and we have traveled the world including numerous stays at Fairmont resorts. 

Instead of making the evening better he made it worse. Making me wait another 10 min for new keys to original rooms when I came down there wasn't even a rollaway bed in both rooms. It is now almost 8 pm. 

We were on such a high with our family experiencing Canada and raving about all the people at Whistler Fairmont, your guest relations manager has completely ruined it for me. I am so insulted and disgusted by his behavior. 

I am reporting this to your head customer service, TripAdvisor and Google reviews.

555,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Such a lovely stay.

I always enjoy a Fairmont stay. Do you drive an EV? You get FREE valet parking. You read that right. Free parking, for EVs! 

The water in the cucumber and orange water in the lobby is a perfect touch after you've been walking around the city the whole day. It's all the little things about this hotel. The soaps, shower gel. Such a pleasant smell. Great staff. Always do pleasant. 

For a perfect appetizer and happy hour head down to the Arc bar and visit Frank. He'll set you up in style! We had a wonderful set of appetizers, champagne (it was my Birthday!) and cocktails. Then we set off into the city for the evening for entertainment and dinner. But it was the perfect way to start the evening. Greatness definitely got started there. They have these delicious parsnip chips that are not to be missed! They're a local delicacy. You can only get them in B.C.!",2016-05-11T14:08:57Z,143

557,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"This is my hotel of choice in Vancouver! I love the  Fairmonts in Vancouver but I especially like the Waterfront. The location is perfect with direct access to waterfront station so it is super convenient. The lobby is understated yet luxurious. Great service every time too.

The rooms are modern and spacious. My favourite are the corner rooms - you get awesome views of the harbour and the city! There are floor-to-ceiling windows and two sets of curtains so you can control how much light you want coming into the room.

The only reason for detracting a star is the bathrooms, specifically the bathtubs. They're definitely from an older era and not very deep. If they revamped the bathtubs here, it would be a 5-star place for sure!

I love ARC restaurant and would recommend a visit if you're staying here (I have a review about it on here somewhere). Room service is very good too - consistently good dishes with nice presentation and fast service!

In terms of scene, it's like the self-assured older cousin to the Pac Rim's flashy adolescent crowd. I much prefer the type of people who stay here.

Overall, a fantastic hotel!",2016-04-10T05:01:03Z,143
558,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"We stayed at this Fairmont and enjoyed our time of relaxation before our cruise. Customer service was exceptional, and the room comfortable. The view overlooking the water was pleasing to the eyes, and what made our visit even nicer was how they offer to take your bags to the cruise ship for you!

560,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"It was ok. We have visited several Fairmont properties and normally they are five stars. The room was nice but really small and no turndown service. The room was clean, but the bed was not as comfortable as I would expect and the pillows need replacing. Received two free drinks for being president's club members but the fine print said they were only good for beer or wine. I guess I shouldn't complain about something that is free. Also was denied an upgrade to a room with a better view even though we pre paid at a price $100 per night higher than what was being offered at time of check in for the same room. Reception confirmed plenty of rooms were available but only if we would pay for the upgraded view.",2019-06-01T04:47:10Z,143

The management was so irresponsible and irrationally justified it, putting the blame on the airplane company which took our party of three to Vancouver.

566,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"We have never considered Fairmont hotels to be on par with such brands as Four Seasons,, Park Hyatt, or Ritz Carlton. But if you book here and stay on the Gold floors 8 or 9, I believe you will be find this hotel compares favorably with the high end luxury hotels at a more reasonable price. Breakfast alone here is worth the increased cost for the Gold floor. Beyond that, there is private concierge service, expedited checkout, snacks throughout the day and evening, plus a self service cocktail honor bar starting at 5PM, premium rooms with great views of the Vancouver sea activity and a large patio to enjoy day and night. We were impressed!",2017-06-26T04:56:42Z,143
567,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"I enjoyed staying here, and it was better than I expected it to be. The location was within walking distance of the Gaslamp area and other downtown restaurants. It's right by the cruise terminal, so it's perfect to stay here on either end of your trip. 

Weather-permitting, the pool is nice and unique. You enter the Fitness Center, and the hot tub and pool are connected. The pool is outside. It's downtown so it's surrounded by tall buildings, and you get a glimpse of the harbour. Fairmonts are very family-friendly, so expect children running around and splashing. There is an attendant who can get you drinks and pool food. What really impressed me was that they had sunscreen and chilled little towels provided nearby in the Fitness Center. The hot tub is inside, and has two strong jets. The hot tub is also open 24 hours.

In the room, they have a Kurig machine and mini bar. At night they provide you with little bottles of water that you don't have to pay for. The wifi is included, but it was spotty around 10am when everyone is waking up and reading their email/the news on their phone. 

If and when I come back to Vancouver, I would definitely stay here again. It's very nice, clean, and reliably hospitable.",2017-09-22T02:49:40Z,143

569,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"We booked a Signature Harbor View corner room, 9th floor. Checking in was a breeze. Bellhop was helpful. I needed a refrigerator so I can store my special food so they sent one to our room right away. Our room housekeeper was really friendly and accommodating, offered to ""turn down"" our sheets (we had no idea what that meant as we usually don't stay in 4 star hotels so she explained what it was) She provided extra toiletries for us (Le Labo Rose soap, shampoo, shower gel, toothbrush) which was great!
The views are amazing, definitely worth it. The king bed mattress was so soft and comfortable!
In the morning, we were able to borrow two of their complimentary , first-come-first-serve BMW cruise bikes, they proivde you with a map and helmet for safety.
Before we checked out, I had asked for my food to be reheated (I am on a special diet) and someone showed up at the door and brought my food to the kitchen and back to our hotel room in less than 10 minutes. We received superb service and had a wonderful time overall. We won't mind splurging for a room at the hotel the next time we visit Vancouver. Thank you, Fairmont staff!",2019-10-23T00:55:51Z,143

I favour this one over the one across the street because when you walk out, you've got a fantastic view of the water/mountains, facing north.  And unlike the original Pan Pacific, you don't need to climb 2 sets of stairs to get to the main lobby/check-in.

And there are several great sitting areas here.  Nice lobby to see all the action, and the restaurant Arc on the right.  Looks and feels expensive, but the real reason for me not trying is not a fan of hotel restaurants lol.  But I digress.

For the washrooms, it's not the most convenient as it's a bit of a walk on the left, then curls in.  But the stalls are nice ;)",2014-11-20T22:57:56Z,143

Service is very friendly, and the bellhop can even bring your luggage from your room and check it into the ship for you.  Rooms were clean and had a good view, even on the city side.  The bar on the first floor is nice.  I was only in the city for twenty-four hours so I don't know Vancouver well, but it seemed to be walkable to a lot of downtown, and was conveniently located on top of an underground mall as well.  Wi-fi is free, which is another plus if you don't know where you want to go to dinner or need Google maps but are from the U.S. don't want to pay for international data on your phone.

576,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Was here for the TED Conference which was amazing. In spite of TED being an invitation only event and having to ante up ten grand to attend, it is extremely interesting if you find an almost exclusive Caucasian billionaire male attendees list exciting, (yep, they gotta look at their gender and inclusion challenges a bit more seriously). But in spite of all that, TED always gets Larry's brain rebooted and challenges some of his perceptions and biases. Where was I... oh yes, the Fairmont. Sorry about that. It is located adjacent to the Conference Center and makes it very convenient for TED attendees. For some reason unfathomable to Big Larry, we received an upgrade to a VIP room which was a corner space with a great view of the waterfront and a nice big bathroom. The Fairmont is a well coiffed lady who is showing some signs of being ridden hard and put away wet. Nothing too serious, but there was some paint peeling in the bathroom - I mean how hard is that to remedy, folks? The elevator doors made opening and closing sounds that led Larry surmise they may have been steam powered and a few lights on the call board inside the elevators did not illuminate, a dissatisfaction factor as everyone who stays there uses the elevator so you'd think they would keep that space at least spic and span. One Larry gripe that had a high hide chappage factor was that they did not have a fridge. Grrr. Instead they had one of those electronically controlled mini bars that charge you if you move an item and are usually ramped up to a sensitivity that detects a mosquito landing on a beer bottle and invokes a room charge. I hate those things. Would have given four stars but the weekend arrived. The weekend staff is the second string team for sure. Didn't replace used glasses or coffee cups and did not replenish the coffee which usually starts a serious rampage as Big Larry NEEDS his coffee. Boo. Having to call for some is a huge miss for a four star hotel that the Fairmont purports to be. 

Concierge was outstanding and extremely knowledgeable about Vancouver, its environs and the restaurants with enuf pull to get reservations at trendy places that were in high demand. Good Job - no TEDaches in this area. Didn't eat in the restaurant or order room service as there was a food court accessible via hotel elevators which opened early and had a S'bucks and a Tim Hortons plus a McDonald's and a couple of other breakfast places plus a newsstand and a shoe repair and cleaners. Woo hoo. Vittles and services in the bottom of the hotel that didn't sport hotel prices. Sweeeet. Hotel had no paper delivery BTW. 

In the end, it was just a place to sleep near TED. Don't expect the height of luxury and prepare for some sadly missing maintenance. Central location is a plus, though.",2018-04-16T23:32:27Z,143

579,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"While this is probably not the finest Fairmont in the catalog, thanks to its location and age, it is perhaps the best deal.

On a last minute Expedia deal, this hotel is an upscale budget option.  Fantastic comfy beds with great linens and down comforters (a double through, means smaller double beds, meh), large spa and outdoor pool, white fluffy robes with the Fairmont insignia, and Le Labo Rose 31 bath products (heck yeah!) make this a great option in Vancouver.  Location is right on the Waterfront, adjacent and easy walking distance to Gastown, so Gastown at your fingertips, but in a slightly nicer neighborhood.

This is a faded rose, but hey, its a La Labo Rose 31, so I can absolutely deal.  Tips: join the Fairmont President's Club for free online before you go or pay ridiculous fees for your daily wifi connection, and whatever you do, do not park at the hotel.  At $44 a night, your parking costs will increase your overall costs considerably, particularly since there are about half a dozen overnight self-park parking lots within walking distance at anywhere from $20 to $10 a day (and some $4 on the weekends, even!) and many of these have unlimited in and outs.",2012-05-27T02:50:49Z,143

583,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Update review:
After posting the bad review below, a rep from the hotel sent me an email thanking me for my feedback on yelp, and then refunded me parking during my stay, a $44 value. No benefit to me, because it was a business trip charged to my client, but I am grateful of the effort. It's nice to know that they check yelp for bad reviews and still try to solve them. I can't say if the toilet, elevators or coffee pot were ever fixed, but a few good things remain, friendly,caring staff and a great view of Vancouver. So I'll add a star for the effort. 

*** 

Bad review! The view was nice and staff 
friendly but... Here's a open letter I sent to the manager (she offered an upgrade next time, even though I'm not planning on returning to Van, BC)

I can't remember what room I was in but it was on the 14th floor. The toilet did not flush, even when I held it down. It would take about three flushes before it worked. 

The coffee pot did not brew. 

I was a bit upset that someone came in to my room and closed my drapes without my permission, while I was out. 

My coworker was on the 21st floor, but I did not have access to use the elevator to go up. So I had him come down instead. I don't understand why I can't have access to his floor but he could have access to my floor. 

When I arrived initially, I parked in the self parking garage. I had a lot of gear about 4 pieces of luggage. I took the elevator up to the mall, walked to the hotel entrance, but the elevators won't open without a key card. So I used the courtesy phone to call for help. They said I could take the escalator. I explained that I could not, because of all my gear, so they said they would send a bell boy. It took him about 15 minutes to help me, too long in my opinion. But he was helpful and friendly. The whole staff was, but I expect the toilet, elevators and coffee pot to work at a world class hotel like the Fairmont. I'm staying at the Travel-lodge tonight at the Vancouver airport, and I could give this place a much better review.  

Having said all of this, the view at your hotel is great, and your staff is friendly. I guess it's all the luck of the draw.",2014-03-04T22:44:28Z,143

As far as extra pampering, the gym is nice, but I especially enjoyed their whirlpool and rooftop pool.  The toiletries are also really nice hippy stuff and they refill it daily.  Towels are nice and fluffy too.

The staff were all wonderful and friendly.  Feel free to exchange USD for CAD as needed.  They even do that without any service charges.  Then take the CAD and head downstairs to the food court if you need some food on the cheap.  

If you are here for a Disney Cruise they will take your luggage to the ship, that may have been the best part of the stay.

592,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"My family (3 adults) recently spent four nights at this hotel on our second trip to Vancouver. We had a West Coast Suite with Gold Lounge privileges. The two reasons we selected this hotel were the location and the reviews, which were spot on. All in all our stay was perfect and a few minor issues were handled promptly and to our satisfaction. The hotel is a buzz of activity throughout the day with a combination of business travelers, tourists, guests going on tours and others on cruises. The concierge desk was always brimming with activity as the concierge team was working with guests. They were very helpful to us. The valet staff were great and very hard working. All of the hotel staff were professional, outgoing, helpful and went out of their way to be of assistance. Housekeeping did a very good job cleaning our room each day and replenishing linens and supplies. 

Our room was beautiful, with a lovely view and the perfect size for a family. The bathroom was a good size with a walk in shower, which we prefer. We also enjoyed seeing the hotel gardens, as well as the beehives.

The Gold Lounge had a wonderful ambiance with comfortable seating and gorgeous views, as well as an outdoor patio area. The food offerings at breakfast were wonderful - just about everything a person would want. Our only issue was that the eggs and meat offerings were not hot and on a couple of mornings were cold. The nighttime canapés and various cheeses were delicious. The Gold Lounge staff could not have been more accommodating. It was very enjoyable and we were glad we selected this option. We had lunch at the hotel restaurant and it was delicious. The service was very attentive.

The location can't be beat - steps away from the Canada Line that took us to and from the airport, across the street from the cruise terminal where we were able to see a few ships arrive and depart. The hotel is also across from Canada Place and the Convention Center. Two evenings we took the house car to dinner, which was so convenient and a very nice amenity.

We had a fantastic stay in downtown Vancouver at this hotel. When we return to Vancouver for the third time, this is the hotel we will be staying at. We highly recommend the Fairmont Waterfront.",2015-09-14T22:38:09Z,143

The room was stunning with a beautiful view of the harbor and included the most comfortable and lush king-sized bed, slippers, robes, a stocked mini-bar, high quality bath products, marble shower, and a TV inside the bathroom mirror.  It felt like paradise!  The room was peaceful with not a peep of noise from the hall or surrounding rooms.  The Gold status 9th floor included free Wi-Fi, and a lounge that served an amazing complimentary buffet breakfast with a huge selection of food, delicious appetizers, off the chart desserts, and an honor bar with a variety of wine, beer, alcohol and mixers.  The hotel has a fitness center with all the equipment needed to get in a great workout.  Off the fitness center is an outdoor pool heated to a comfortable level that is usable during the winter and an indoor hot tub.  Not a detail is missed, and I can't wait to stay at the Fairmont Waterfront Vancouver again!",2020-02-21T20:20:20Z,143
598,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,We really enjoyed our stay! Staff was very friendly and helpful! The concierge gave us great advice on places to eat and areas to go to or avoid. She also helped us book our day trip of whale watching and visiting Victoria Island.   The hotel is within walking distance of many great shops and restaurants. The room was clean and comfortable. We had a great view of the water too! It is a bit pricey and you also have to pay additional for parking but you get what you pay for and it was worth it!,2019-06-02T07:36:03Z,143
599,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,Can anyone at the Fairmont tell me why you are keeping $290 of my money when the reservation was cancelled about six weeks before my trip?  I'll never use this hotel again...we are in a global crisis and you keep $290 of my money and then close the hotel?  Wtf?,2020-05-02T12:14:44Z,143
600,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Great location!  Across street from the cruise port.  Bell services will take your luggage and transport to the port for gratuities only. There is a Disney service desk if you had made arrangements through DCL.

Lobby area is clean, inviting and well kept.  The room was comfortable, spacious and clean.  Easy checkin, and our room was available when we got there at 12.  

Pool is great sized and the lounge chairs and towels were comfy.  

Downside - Wifi was extra charge.",2017-08-08T13:23:14Z,143
601,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"So much better than the Ritz Carlton, every need is attended to with professional dispatch and courtesy.  Stay on the Gold floors(8&9) and enjoy complementary breakfast, canapes, and desert. The Gold floor guests have a personal Concierge that is outstanding.  The ARC restaurant on the lobby floor is excellent; we enjoyed the halibut and lamb for dinner and the Beef Brisket sliders for lunch.  We ordered a complimentary chauffeur driven BMW car to take us to Stanley Park and used the always available taxi services for evening outings.  This will be our 'Go To' hotel in Vancouver BC.  OH, I almost forgot to mention the local version of a Bloody Mary, the 'Caesar'  Wow!!",2017-08-25T22:15:34Z,143
602,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"What a sweet jewel! We disembarked from our cruise ship and wheeled our luggage a few feet hoping to see the Fairmont Waterfront and sure enough, right in front of us! Not only is the location a 10, but the friendly and helpful staff are honestly sincere and so welcoming. Our bellman (Gabriel), the valet (Alfredo), the concierge (Jason), the housekeepers, etc are all well-informed and genuinely seem to enjoy taking care of their guests. This is an amazing feat for them as it's Canada Day (crazy number of people here!) and the hotel is sold out. Thank you for a blessed stay.",2017-07-02T21:58:36Z,143
603,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"I bought a night at the Fairmont Waterfront through Groupon. It was fun to leave work and play tourist for the night. My feelings about this Fairmont is mixed. 

When I checked in, I showed the receptionist my Groupon on my phone via the Groupon app, which is supposed to save you from having to print out Groupons. She told me that they needed a print out and suggested that I email her a copy of the receipt. I ended up having to get on my laptop in the lobby, which wasn't a huge deal except for the fact that they charge something like $15 for wifi. Fortunately, I had a Fairmont gold membership (sign up, it's free!) so I didn't have to pay for the wifi. I would have been pretty bitter if I had to shell out $15 just to use my Groupon, so I am glad it all worked out. (2 stars)

Other than that, the customer service is really great. My wife wanted to go swimming but forgot her suit so we inquired about buying one at the front desk. The manager came out and took us to the gym to see their selection. She was very patient as my wife tried to decide, and ultimately declined the suits. I went swimming without her in the heated pool at night and it was fun to see the downtown buildings lit up. (5 stars)

The rooms are a bit on the older side. I upgraded us to a water view, but wouldn't necessarily recommend this because it had us facing the convention centre, which has a large, flashing TV screen going all night long. Also, the phone in our room didn't work. (2 stars)

As we checked out, the woman at the front desk asked what our Thanksgiving plans were. I said we didn't have any and she gave me a coupon for a free bottle of wine at their restaurant. I thought this was a nice touch. (5 stars)

Overall, I give Fairmont Waterfront 3.5 stars. I'll go ahead and round up since I got a good deal on the room.",2010-11-10T02:55:44Z,143
604,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"The first nights of ""Parental Anniversary Trip 2008"" were spent here.  

The Fairmont Watefront is a hotel in the ""modern"" style, which I suppose means that the lobby floor is very shiny and the hotel bar is out in the open.

The hotel rooms are nicely appointed, with a minibar and cable tv.  I thought the bed was average -- but i'm a very tough customer to please when it comes to hotel beds.  (They're usually far too firm for me.) 

The staff, like all Fairmonts is helpful and friendly.  This Fairmont is out near the ""gastown"" section of the city, which is quite touristy feeling.  I think that in general our group would probably have had a better time in the older Fairmont downtown -- but that's really not the hotel's fault -- just a note if you're looking at staying in this part of vancouver. 

This hotel is within short walking distance of a float plane terminal, so if you were interested in using a water taxi to get to another part of the area it might be quite convienent for that.  

There is an underground shopping center under this hotel, so if you need a snack or beverage, quite handy.",2008-11-27T00:28:29Z,143
605,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,I just wanted to take a moment and say a huge thank you to Laura Ramos (GSA) who made our rather complicated room search/check in process a breeze.  She was outstanding to work with and was incredibly accommodating and patient!  It's staff like Laura who are one of the primary reasons that we come back to Fairmont properties over and over again.  She and the rest of the staff make the stay and experience nothing short of amazing.,2017-09-17T19:07:33Z,143
606,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"OK so here's how it works apparently...if you are a newbie business traveller or only book hotels occasionally you get the chump deals. IF, however, you are a little more savvy and/or ""complain-y"", customer service improves 10-fold!

Once another savvier than me Yelper told me that you just have to sign up for Fairmont's President Club (which is free so why wouldn't everyone!?!?) internet is gratis! You also then get free daily newspapers and can start tallying up points to get a free nights stay or move up to Gold or Premium or something.
Anyway, i was mostly concerned about the internet so... problem was solved. 

But what recently impressed me was this...while making a reservation I was asked to complete a survey. Since i actually had a few grievances (the nasty perfumy bath products and recent increase in govt rates) I decided to spend 5 min on it. 

Well did the manager not email me giving me a better rate on my next trip (although acknowledging that all govt rates increased so nothing he could do about future trips) and saying that they had recently changed the bath products and would like to hear back. MAJOR POINTS! 
Good customer service is hard to come buy these days so I really appreciated the personal touch...not to mention the discount on 5 nights! 

Unfortunately I can't stay there in the future due to the price increase but will look out for discounts in the future.   

So where should I book next Yelpers?? Coast Coal Harbour is an option as is Wall Center...or should I go boutique with The Burrard?",2012-08-05T17:06:34Z,143
607,Fairmont Waterfront,4.0,"Great hotel! Decided to stay here on a whim after visiting family in Bellingham. We had our two kids with us age 4 and 7. We actually swam in the outdoor pool in November, because it was heated! Beautiful view from the rooms of the water. We got the breakfast package buffet. It was large and yummy! The staff was super nice to our kids, which for me is the way it should always be. Felt cared for and in a warm environment. Best pancakes I ever had that the chef made for our kids. I finished them off!",2014-11-03T18:17:29Z,143
608,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"This hotel is wonderful! Amazing location at Canada place so it's a good central spot for all the things you need to see and do. There is a Starbucks at the bottom so you can grab a cup of coffee without going too far. The standard room was nice with lots of space and a desk to work. The bathroom was spacious and the shower was relaxing with its rainfall shower head and wand. The most impressive part was the rooftop pool! What a gorgeous view! Be sure to check it out at sunset. One thing to note: pay attention to the elevators since they don't all go to all the floors or down to street level, it's easy to get on the wrong one.",2023-12-29T00:32:39Z,235
609,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"The highlight was seeing this awesome vintage vehicle at the front. 

Don't get me wrong, the view is amazing, especially a different cruise ship that docks next to the resort every day.. 

However: Everything costs money, even using wifi in your own room ($5/day) - It's actually ridiculous LOL. 

Also I waited 8 hours to be checked into my room :)

610,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"Stayed here overnight before a cruise. Was a very nice hotel with beautiful views from my room. Only complaint was that we had requested late check out, received it, then got an alarming call during breakfast that they were moving our stuff cuz we hadn't checked out yet. Something worth noting- they have a gratuity based service that gets your bags delivered to your cruise ship which was super convenient.",2023-09-01T19:00:40Z,235
611,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"Hey Yelpers! The wife and I stayed here before our cruise out of Vancouver. This hotel is soo nice! The room was spacious and well appointed. We got a harbor view room that overlooked Stanley Park across the harbor. Amazing view! The staff are all very friendly, especially the bellmen (Tynan was the best!). The hotel is located right in the middle of a lot of good restaurants and things to do. See below for that list!
One awesome thing about this hotel is that if you are cruising from here, they will deliver your bags to the cruise ship for you! Check with the bell desk for details and don't forget money to tip them ($3-$5 per bag is customary and we'll worth it!)
This hotel is definitely worth it, and we will be back the next time we cruise from Vancouver! Put this place on your list of hotels to check out.
Check out my reviews for Tap and Barrel, Freedom Bike Rentals, Chung Chun Rice Hot Dogs, and the Improv Center for other things to experience!",2023-07-03T20:54:13Z,235

614,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"My family and I stayed at pan pacific on a Friday in mid August. We took the train from airport which was very cool and convenient of 30min. We got off and walked 10 min to the hotel. It is connected to convention center at the pier. So the lobby is not on 1st floor instead we had to take the elevator up to L floor. I wish there was a sign instead we had to ask the bellhop guy. The elevators are fast but small inside. 

There was a line to check in at 11:30am. It has a nice view of the pier with the bar and restaurant. Finally we reached the counter lady and she was really nice to help us get our room. The room faced the office building and the dock. Inside the room was nice with big bathroom. The hotel is convenient close to the cruise ships and across the food court. To stay here is pricey unless you use your travel points to get a free room. The lobby has escalators to take to the ground floor. The room is average in side with big bathroom. The view is the port and office building. The AC is kinda weak if you coming during the summer. The beds are firm with nice pillows. It has a small refrigerator and plenty of drawer space. 


Tip, the escalators on 1st floor on the convention side has underground tunnel to food court area. 

2nd tip, the hotel is connected to the Check in terminal connection to ships and the bell hop can send the luggage to ship with a price $13. It is very convenient. 

3rd tip, it's few blocks away from the train and the bus stop.",2022-08-15T21:11:26Z,235

616,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"This review is based on price, location, room quality, and overall experience. 
The location, right by Canada place, and right by the cruise terminal, is phenomenal. We got a room that was facing ocean view of the port, and it was also a club room on a higher floor. It was absolutely gorgeous. The breakfast provided by the club room was amazing and well worth the price of the room. They also had afternoon snacks between 5 and 7 PM which were delicious, and it was open for a good part of the day to get any type of nonalcoholic drink you want it for your room free of charge. We would definitely book this room again! 
So why only four stars and not five? I did not like the initial interaction when we got to the second floor to check in. The woman that was checking me in seemed completely clueless and literally made me very uncomfortable. I am from the USA and she had the audacity to tell me that my debit card could not be used as a credit card, even though I use it as a credit card all the time. When she finally agreed to try it, and it worked, she did not even apologize. I hope to never have to interact with her again, because I found her highly unintelligent and in no way suited for customer service at such a hotel. 
Otherwise, I absolutely love the hotel and will definitely stay here again. We are coming back to cruise again in 11 months and I plan on staying here, and I hope not to get someone so clueless next time when I check in  .",2023-09-08T18:37:47Z,235

Bad cell reception so they have you by the throat.

Severe street addicts problems working its way here. 
Woke government inviting it. 

Beware of travel agents recommendations. They get a sweet kick back.

They will bring your bags onto the cruise ship for you if you call them the morning of. The only reason I took a star off is because the wifi is an added charge, and I'm international, so I don't have mobile data. Great place and great location. If you're going on a cruise in the morning and want it to be a seamless transition from the night before to the ship, it is absolutely perfect for you.",2019-08-09T18:11:56Z,235

I paid for this with my company's intranet discount and that seemed to make it a decent value. You have to pay for many, if not all, of the extra amenities and services with a fee(s): Business room computer for internet, wired/wireless in-room internet(?), all fridge items---even the water bottles... the standard tea/milk/coffee is complimentary. I forgot the fitness area--which I wish I tried out (very clean & nicely appointed).

I do wish the garage had motorcycle-designated parking... unless I didn't find it. Lastly, I wish the bathroom had an actual ventilation fan for those hot & moist showers.",2013-07-05T17:25:16Z,235
620,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"Just had possibly the worst night I have ever spent in a hotel. 
It was my wifes birthday, so we decided to stay in the Pan Pacific as a treat. 
The room was lovely and we were upgraded to a harbour view room at no expense. 
When we arrived back after our night out(around 1:30am) we were greeted with the noise of a party on our floor. The loud music and shouting was enough for me to knock into the room to complain. They didnt seem to care that they were keeping people up all night and the party continued, so I called security and they said they would take care of it. 
I had to call a second time, as nobody turned up from my first call. 
Now 3:30 am, the music finally stops and we try to sleep, but the loud talking and shouting seems to coninue until 4:30. 
This is when i notice the other noises of the hotel. It sound like go karts in the ceiling and at times made the room vibrate. Pillows drowned the noise out enough for us to get some sleep, exhausted !
We were woken at 7:30 by the sea planes directly outside our window, something that we were not told about and extremely loud !
So after less then 3 hours sleep we were done and decided to check out early and go home to our own bed ! 
When checking out, I made my complaints and was told they had lots of conplaints last night. Thats it !! 
No remorse whatsoever. 
For the money we paid, Pan Pacific should be ashamed of themselves ! 
Do not stay here if you want a quite night in downtown Vancouver",2017-12-10T20:17:38Z,235

If you're here for a business tradeshow/convention, you won't be far off, and if you're here for leisure, you've found the right place - this hotel faces the ocean with a stunning view!

I absolutely loved my stay here - our room was clean, service was great, and our suite's view facing the ocean was just so peaceful. 

I called room service one morning because I needed q-tips. The room service guy came to my room less than 10 minutes after I called. 

Great hotel!",2013-04-25T16:41:07Z,235
623,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,This is a fantastic hotel!  We stayed here for 2 days prior to getting on a Disney cruise to Alaska.  The hotel makes it so convenient as they will take your bags directly to the port and you will see your bags directly on the ship after giving it to the bellman.  The club lounge in this restaurant also has a great breakfast and snacks throughout the day!  I would highly recommend spending the extra for the club lounge.,2019-06-15T02:19:59Z,235

Last time we stayed for Valentine's Day weekend and they told me they were all out of King beds when they told my sister in law they were all out of 2 double beds! I asked front desk for a king size bed and she immediately said there is none available. When I mentioned what my sil said, she went to the back office for like a min and came back and said there were king beds available. Seriously??? 
One thing I noticed is that the Internet is very slow in the city view side whereas the internet speed was normal in the water side. That's kind of important to us Washingtonians.",2016-03-22T04:42:03Z,235

That part of the shower was main negative of the room.  The fitness center is weirdly located in the parking garage basement next to a cruise ship loading dock.  Location was fantastic so we walked most of the time. Parking was 50cad per night with unlimited in/out when we went which was okay for the convenience in comparison to other options.

629,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"Horrible experience at the Pan Pacific in Vancouver BC!  Management has been uncaring and absent during our 3-night stay. 

Our first night we were placed in a suite (as reserved) with a king mattress that had been broken down on each side by numerous visitors. Unable to sleep. Requested a room change the next day and were given a new room, but on the second day our room went uncleaned, even though we were absent the entire day. Letter under the door from Gary Collinge, general manager, told us he regretted the inconvenience of not being able to clean our room. Trash had not been emptied, towels had not been replaced, bed not made, etc.  A call to the front desk to request new towels was accomplished by a hotel maintenance man who handed us our new towels in plastic bags and left. 

As Platinum status travelers with Pan Pacific's frequent visitor program, we shudder to image how this hotel must treat visitors without such status. Our room was $550-600 per night and this is the experience Pan Pacific believes is acceptable.",2023-08-01T03:28:22Z,235
630,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"Prime Location.

Visited Vancouver for the first time last week and had the pleasure of staying at the Pan Pacific.  The hotel is located in Canada Place and is located downtown in a PRIME location, walking distance from almost everything.  It was a little pricey but it was very comparable to all the other hotels in the area.  

The check in experience was fabulous. Normally check in is at 4pm, however I arrived in Vancouver sooner than expected (10am) and my room was ready by 11am...I couldn't believe it.  

They allow pets and were very welcoming to my pooch, even giving him a dog treat.  The staff were all super friendly and helpful, and the room was very spacious and comfortable.  

I ordered room service for breakfast and it was AMAZING.  Probably the best Eggs Benedict I've had.  (pics attached).

638,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"Stayed one night as pre cruise hotel. Part of a cruise package that included luggage transfer from room to ship. A bellhop was supposed to pickup luggages from our room after checking out. Our set of luggages, all properly tagged, ended up being loaded onto a different cruise ship. My cruise ship only realized it after sailing off and after I notified them my luggage had not been delivered. WTH!!! Not saying the bellhop made a mistake. Just that it was the origin and beginning of our luggage transfer. 
Room AC wasn't working. I didn't bother telling them because it was just one night. Convention was going on and many routes and access points were blocked off from within the hotel to the cruise terminal area. We and another couple went a very circuitous route to reach the correct area to begin embarkation process. Lack of signage and personnel to direct from hotel to the embarkation area. 
Location is the only thing going for it. Check in staff not friendly. No welcoming smile. Maybe the grumpy look is the new fad in hospitality. Certainly not worth the price that was charged for a meh room with dirty windows overlooking the the street and buildings. Weird and confusing hours for the various over priced dining options. Next time we'll stay at the Hampton Inn and Suites where we had used on a previous pre-cruise hotel stay.

What else is great about Vancouver is this wonderful hotel, Pan Pacific. There is nothing that my wife and I didn't like. The view of the Burrard Inlet, watching the sea-planes take off from the water. The most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. The large rooms and bathrooms are up to date. The accommodating and friendly staff were awesome. It's location is close to everything, and to the metro from the airport. I can't speak more highly of our stay. 

Next time I come to Vancouver, Pan Pacific will be the hotel I'll be staying at.",2019-11-12T00:08:39Z,235
640,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"Not what we expected. For the price we payed, the place is not worth it. Broken air-conditioning, confusing parking, one room cleaning for one weeks stay and overpriced breakfast are only some of the issues. The positive is the locations and the rooms are specious. Should have stayed at the Fairmont! Not recommended.",2022-08-28T03:28:38Z,235
641,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"Nice hotel overall.  Good staff and housekeeping.  Club level was very nice and worth the added cost, given the free breakfast and evening snacks (though I wish they'd offer a free wine or beer instead of a 'honor bar').  Club level floors (21-23) have also been recently 'refreshed' making them a good value in comparison to reviews of other floors.  Aileen in club level lounge is a treasure and great resource for planning the day, and the car rental downstairs is a good last-minute option (I booked a same-day car through Costco Travel online to drive to Whistler for C$50, which is affordable freedom). 

Biggest disappointment: the TV had very limited channels.  In 2019, the tv should have netflix available and built-in.  I tried to plug computer or iPad into TV to stream that way, but conceirge had no cable to do so.  As a work-around I asked if I could borrow a DVD player, but the only one he had was 8 years old and pre-Netflix!!  I didn't come to Vancouver to watch TV, but after a long day out, and with kids, this is nearly essential.

Other things we expected from a top-tier hotel: a selection of pillow type (firmness); more TV channels (there were 40, of which 10 were french, 10 were sports, so very limited!); a bedside clock with a modern phone dock (had pre-lightning iphone dock! Very old).  The outdoor hot tub was closed during my stay.  

Location was very good and central (and a short walk to the best meal I had during my vacation: dinner at Botanist).  Right next to train station, so major points for convenience and location.

And though I wish I'd been upgraded to a suite or something with a view (given my 9-day stay and several thousands spent here), I did appreciate that my city view room 2108 was extra long, to accommodate a sofa-bed which let our kids 'spread out' a little and rest easier.  If I'd gotten an upgrade to suite (which seemed available), the review would be a solid 5*.",2019-04-01T22:45:23Z,235
642,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"This is Vancouver's well kept secret - this bar/lounge/restaurant!

While visiting Vancouver for the weekend, I wanted to find a cool rooftop bar or restaurant with a great view. All the blogs listed the same places so I planned on going to one of these. However, after accidentally walking into this interesting hotel that looks like a cruise ship, I found a bar with an outdoor patio right on the water!

I came back later with my roommate and enjoyed a lovely evening with cocktails, a charcuterie board, and one of the best salads I have ever eaten!

643,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"while the service and the staff has been spectacular, including the food, we upgraded our room for a harbor view.  we landed a room directly eye level with the pool and very little ""harbor"".  the pool is exceptionally busy here in April.  the children are very loud while enjoying the pool, as they should be, but we are vacationing and don't appreciate the noise.  it's also open until 10PM!

the ice machine on our floor is broken so we have to travel two floors up to get ice.  We are early risers no breakfast is not available until 7PM for room service.  I had to walk around town to find a place open that served breakfast.

This hotel is located in the heart of downtown, so its a great stay of you want to do some sight seeing.  Tons of things to do for free or on the cheap surround this hotel. 

I've stayed in hotels all around the world, and I can't remember a more comfortable bed. Room service had nice selections.... (I was OBSESSED with their Salmon)  and the upper lobby has a nice bar where lounge singers and gifted pianists lull you into a cruise like, care free ""I'm on vacation"" vibe. 

You can catch a free shuttle tour outside, or just walk around the city at your leisure because everything is at arms length.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel! Very comfortable and peaceful!",2020-09-28T01:25:30Z,235
646,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,I would give it a 4+ for the views. The room was amazing overlooking the harbour. The challenge is there are only four elevators and lots of people staying for cruise ships. Waiting sometimes 10-15+ minutes for an elevator and then stopping floor.

We're great Rooms we're big , bathroom was big 
U comfortably can have 2-3 pple in a king size room without bumping into each other. Tv had to be a 55+ 
Quality of sheets , bed linen , towels all smelled good 
Bed was comfy, couch bed not as comfy but it is a ""couch bed"" to b expected. Panoramic windows 
U can see waterfront, cruise ships, and city all at once.
Location was perfect to Robson st. short walk or stop 3 on hop on/off. Pacific centre 10 min walk.
All ticket sales done with concierge or front of hotel

I was able to hit up the gym prior to heading to the cruise ship and I was happy with all of the gym equipment and amenities- they got the job done!!

I have to give a huge shout out to the Conceirge, Jenie! She went above and beyond to welcome my friend and I and even got us a room upgrade, which only further enhanced my stay at the Pan Pacific!

650,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"All my life the people around me have always gravitated towards this hotel. 

One of my very first fine dining experiences was with my mom when I was just in grade school. To this day I still go to their five sails restaurant. I remember how big and extravagant everything looked. The hotel is well maintained and greets you with a beautiful waterfall fountain alongside the escalators. The ceilings are high, space open, and small accents of greenery appear every few steps. 

What I also appreciate is the amazing spa inside. Everything from the service to the decor was spot on! A convenient and easy way to relax without going far.

There's also a small section filled with boutiques so you can shop in your hotel! 

The rooms are very clean but more on the classic side as opposed to modern or posh. Nevertheless-an extravagant experience. 

If you're short on time or lazy room service is available but 3/5. Hit up one of their restaurants.",2019-07-12T18:14:28Z,235
651,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"Pan Pacific Vancouver is ok. It's dated without a lot of amenities, but the location can't be beat. If you can, get a room overlooking the harbor and you'll have an awesome view, seaplanes and all.

It's attached to the convention center and a convenient place to stay if you need proximity to the downtown area. The bed was a little too soft for my liking and it was a bit of a pain to get to the fitness center, since you had to go outside to access it. 

Overall, it's an ideal location for getting around and very walkable to all that Robson St. has to offer. If you're not looking for anything super fancy, Pan Pacific will do the job.",2019-02-05T01:24:54Z,235

The location is great, the view is great. The rooms are dated and the shower curtain smelled like mold really bad which could be a super quick replacement. Initially our room wasn't ready until 4PM with Covid and a very small amount of people staying in the hotel. 

Everyone on the phone was super rude when making requests, I assume it's all new people due to what is going on.

When we checked in, we asked about daily housekeeping and were told that there is none. We were told that Canada is recently opening up and hotels in the area are not doing that. That was very upsetting. So I called the nearby Fairmont and the Marriott. Of course they have daily housekeeping, they responded. Pan Pacific is very disappointing.",2022-06-29T21:02:41Z,235

The location is ideal for getting around Vancouver, their views are unparalleled, their rooms are spacious and well maintained, their rooftop hot tub and pool is stunning, their fitness center is great, their staff are exceptionally personable, and their breakfast buffet (when it's available) is fantastic.

You don't really need to ever leave the hotel - when you're at Pan Pacific. We even ordered room service here and it was one of the best we've ever had. The presentation was lovely and everything arrived hot and cooked perfectly. 

Pan Pacific isn't cheap - but it's a beautiful classic hotel that has always served us well around the holidays.

658,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"The doorman was a little out of it last weekend. We pulled up to drop off my guests to have lunch at their restaurant Ocean 999, but the doorman refused to let us off at the front, and instead directed me to drive forward to the next spot, when there's nobody else behind me. 

So why? Is it the car? Our clothes? I'm quite puzzled by such discriminating treatment. (To be sure, I sat outside after lunch for a good ten minutes. He allowed whoever pulling up to be dropped off there.)

Oh, and the doorman needs to hem his pants. They're far too long for him, although it matches his sloppiness.

660,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"This is a great hotel!
Modern without being stuffy.
Everyone we encountered working here was very friendly.
The entrance keeps out any riff raff and the elevator up to the rooms is fast.
You are right on the water here and walking out to grab a bite or coffee is easy. What a view at any time of day. Pretty safe too.
Even the city view rooms are nice with views of the streets and high buildings.
Vancouver is clean. So nice. People here are the best!

We opted for an Executive floor and this has many advantages. We loved the lounge. The snacks, drinks, staff. Again, the VIEW! The snacks are really good. Unlimited fridge drinks. Alcohol - 1 free drink a day but there is an honor bar system where if you want more, you fill out a little sheet with your room info on it.
Free continental breakfast that goes til 1030am!
I would only stay on the higher floors now, spoiled by the lounge, the quiet environment and our own Concierge. And, free internet which for other floors, is not? Odd in this day and age.

ROOMS 
Our room was alright. 3 stars.
Oddly shaped.
COLD tile floors at entrance, closet and bathroom. Brrr. Wear the slippers they give you or bring socks.
Comfy robes.
Terrible lighting throughout. I would change this.
NO TUB. At day's end when we have walked 24,000 steps, all I want is a hot bath. I was under the impression our room had one when coming here and brought all my bath stuff. No tub.
Huge TV! The cable went out a lot but no big deal.
Microwave was brought to us upon request, no charge.
Mini fridge. We did not use anything but did like that nothing was on sensors, That is just annoying, 
Coffee maker. Good. No charge for coffee/tea. You can also make cappuccinos in the lounge if you stay on floor 21-23.
Maid service was terrific. We only had them come in 1 day out of 4  but they did a great job. We got welcome chocolates coming in and choc. covered strawberries the night before we left.
Lots of clothing storage.
Turn down service if you want it. They leave you bottled water beside the beds.

Cannot speak to parking but getting a taxi to and from the airport here was easy.

Not cheap to stay here but for sure warrants at least 4 - 4.5 stars. We had an easy, restful time with many perks.
It was between Pacific Rim and here when booking. Glad we chose the Pan and would return.",2017-07-28T18:53:58Z,235

+ Hands down best/most picturesque/peaceful location in all of Vancouver - the only hotels that beat out the Pan Pacific on this front are the two Fairmont hotels; if you can get a room that faces Coal Harbour you are bound to have an amazing stay
+ Service was impeccable - staff have incredible attitudes and treat you like royalty the minute you step in
+ Sadly everything else about it was average - the room was very okay and the bed/sheets were not comfortable at all. I didn't feel like it was a 5-star hotel based on these aspects alone",2019-05-25T04:37:03Z,235

Parking is available downstairs under Canada Place, but who knows how much one has to pay.  Better to just get here via SkyTrain.

The pool is salt water, which means that one's eyes don't sting like lesser chlorine pools.  Towels are provided.  There's also a hot tub, as well as a very large suntanning deck, for those who enjoy baking and possibly getting skin cancer.

668,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"It's an amazing hotel. Maybe that's just because I've never stayed at any place like this before (being mostly a La Quinta type of guy), but it is amazing.  Not just because of the hotel, but .... Well, my SUITE overlooked Vancouver Harbor.

Room service is great. The Breakfast I had was wonderful. Room Service coffee is about 10,000 times better than the coffee in the room - so, I leave that up to you. 

Like so many hotels I think that they need more power plugs in this connected age, but I've yet to find any hotel on the planet that meets my needs. 

The hotel is convenient to public transportation, tours (with information booths right outside the convention center), the seaplane port, and of course the cruise ship terminal which is connected to it directly. I wanted too get a boat and take it out the floating Chevron Station in the harbor and see if they had a Slurpee machine. 

If you can afford it, it is the place to stay as far as I'm concerned. 

Two quick things to be aware of - 

1: while overall the hotel is very, very quiet, the seaplanes start at 7am and that first morning we woke up to that. Me being the ""security minded type"" (ex-military police) I was like ""WHAT THE HE!! IS THAT???"" - but after you realize what it is, it's really, really cool to watch them take off (and our view was right along their takeoff and landing routes). 
 
2. the 9pm Gun - Yeah.. yah know... if the city fires a 19th Century Cannon every night at 9pm... that's something they should warn people about.... It should be in big letters somewhere in the room, ""HEY! BTW - at 9pm there will be a Earth Shattering Kaboom - it's nothing to worry about,"" or something like that. We had no clue the first night. 

The 9 O'Clock Gun is a 12-pounder cast in 1816 and was used as a time marker for mariners to set their chronometers.  Which I guess is better than Lighthouse Keeper William D. Jones tossing a stick of dynamite into the water (JESUS CHRIST VANCOUVER! HEALTH AND SAFETY - oh, who am I kidding, I'm from Texas where people stuff toilets full of tananite and shoot at it....  )",2018-09-28T20:59:36Z,235

670,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"This hotel is located right inside the Canada Place with great city views or harbor views from the rooms. But with that being said, it might be a bit confusing if you've never been here before. 

Upon arriving, if you choose to Valet park your car, just pull up to the front, but once you get inside, take ESCALATOR UP to the next floor to check in. If you choose to park your car yourself, drive in the garage, bring the parking ticket with you, take ELEVATOR UP to L (Lobby floor). If you want to park the car yourself, consider how much luggage you have, you either have to haul everything or make multiple trips to get everything from your car to your room, or maybe you can ask if the front desk have a bell man who can help you with that (we didn't cause we manged to get all of our luggage in one trip).

I put in the notes for reservation when I booked the hotel that this was my for my husband's birthday. The receptionist made sure to greeted him Happy Birthday, he made sure we knew our way around town, and also upgraded us for free, instead of the city view room, we got the harbor view room! I loveee lovee our view. It's just so peaceful and relaxing. 

The hotel is right downtown so there are tons of restaurants to eat all over the place. You can either walk to them or if you drive, it's about 5-10 minutes drive. Right inside the hotel they also have 2 different restaurants and 2 or 3 bars if you don't feel like leaving your hotel. We dined at Ocean999 for my husband's birthday dinner (please see separate review), it was a great dining experience.

They even sent a small box of chocolate to our room for my husband's birthday. 

Overall we had a wonderful experience with the hotel, their staff and their restaurant/bar. My only complain is when we requested for more towels it took forever for them to bring the towels up, they took so long that we thought maybe they weren't going to anymore.

672,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"I haven't had a chance to write a review for my stay at the Pan Pacific.  (Stayed here in August for our wedding anniversary)

Check in was quick and the front desk person was very friendly.  We also received a little chocolate gift in the room which was a thoughtful touch. The room and washroom were clean and tidy. The room looked a little dated compared to the newer/trendier hotels, but not a big deal. 

The view was the best part. At night or in the morning...it was so beautiful! The lights, moutains, water, buildings, float-planes and boats was breath-taking. If you stay in a hotel in Vancouver, you should definitely stay here.

We then went to Spa Utopia and had relaxing massages. My favorite spa in Vancouver. Gorgeous setting, wonderful facilities and amazing service.

After the spa and dinner, we decided to use their rooftop pool. Love it! It was a warm night and it was very romantic to swim and use the hot tub under the stars. There were plenty of towels out for guests to use and the whole pool area was very clean.

We had brunch the next day at Cafe Pacifica and it will always be my favorite brunch. They definitely have the best brunch buffet in Vancouver. A little pricey, but absolutely worth it.",2011-02-25T08:53:24Z,235
673,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"WOW!!! The Pan Pacific is a massive hotel that is located literally next to where all the cruise ships depart from Vancouver. That officially makes it one of the most conveniently located hotels in Vancouver if you are on vacation. Beyond that, it's insanely nice. We booked a room with a harbor view, and it did not disappoint! The view was absolutely amazing. It was completely unobstructed, and we were able to see the cruise ships coming in and out of the harbor, North Vancouver and the mountains, Stanley Park, the convention center and many of the other skyscrapers near the water. The room itself was also very nice. The bed was plush, and very comfortable. The bathroom had beautiful high-end finishes, and included a separate water closet, which was quite convenient. 

Speaking of convenience, there are lots of great restaurants near the hotel's location at Canada Place, including Miku Sushi and Cactus Club Cafe, as well as tour buses that take you around the city. Everything is within walking distance or a short cab ride away.

677,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"We spent our most recent wedding anniversary at the Pan Pacific after finding an amazing deal on Hotwire!   For $100 we had a beautiful king room with a view of the city and the bay.  It was luxurious, and came with all of the service and amenities you would expect in a high-end big-city hotel.  Best of all was that I called ahead and asked if they could have an ice bucket and glasses waiting in the room for some champagne we were bringing along; not only did we find the bucket and glasses, but they had left chocolate covered strawberries and a lovely note as well.  It was a nice touch.

The hotel itself is gorgeous - beautiful lobby area and right in the heart of the city.  You can walk to most of the downtown sights from here, take a cab from the front of the hotel, or grab the Skytrain just down the street for affordable access to the whole city.  The Pan Pacific is also an easy walk to the fun restaurants and bars of Gastown (don't miss the Alibi Room if you like beer and good food).  

If you want a high-end experience in Vancouver, or just an amazing hotel for a special occasion, it would be hard to do better than the Pan Pacific.",2014-02-16T18:49:45Z,235

I got off a cruise ship, they stored my luggage, explained the layout of the town, how to transport around, and the location is in a great spot. I would definitely stay here if I am in the area.",2018-08-07T01:10:50Z,235
679,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"Stayed here a week after New Years. Very comfortable, very clean, very spacious and staff was extremely friendly and accommodating! 

Downstairs they have a cute little cafe/bar with a beautiful view! I really enjoyed just sitting there and watching the propeller planes land and take off. The bar has a nice menu of offerings. Everything from sliders to craft beer. Waiters/Waitress were very friendly and helpful. 

We were very pleased and would stay again if ever in the area! My only complaint is wifi signal is very weak so thankfully this was a family trip and not business related.",2016-04-08T00:29:27Z,235
680,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"Decided to take a break from the mundaneness of my downtown condo and break it up a bit and go to the Pan Pacific. I remember when this got built in the 90's but I must say they are still doing a pretty good job with upkeep on the place. 
Things are still clean, fresh and modern. Prices are a little pricey but after all, it's Vancouver right? The service is still good. The location rocks, can't  really beat a better location than this. I like that if you're a tourist it's a perfect location for sight seeing too because you're right downtown and close to the sea bus and the skytrain. It's usually a decent upper scale crowd of tourists and there's also some nice shopping in the hotel as well. The view of the Northern mountains with the snow caps and ocean is quit lovely as well. It you stay on a Saturday be sure to check out the Sunday brunch!",2018-02-25T22:28:19Z,235
681,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"This place gets a 4 for the location and a 3 for everything else.

Upon check-in, the front desk wanted to charge me more than my reservation.  It took her 10 minutes to find the correct details of my reservation.  

The bed was great and good products in the bathroom. 

Had to pay extra for parking which shouldn't happen when already a paying guest at a hotel.

The room had an excellent view from all of the windows.  The hotel is right on the water in downtown, and the cruise ships port here. We could see Stanley Park.  It was a really beautiful location.",2014-06-08T11:24:49Z,235
682,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"This place is all about location.  It is optimally located on the beautiful waterfront, offering convenient access to the cruise ship terminus and DTVAN.  Out of the hotels to choose from, this is the best locale. Beauty and convenience all in one. 

Instead of repeating the same boring stuff everyone else has said about this place, here are a few useful tips no one else has posted here or Trip Advisor:

If you are taking the SkyTrain, take the Canada line to the Waterfront station; it's a 30 min ride and it's the end of the line.  

If you take the hotel escalators to the ground floor, you can take another escalator down underground to the Waterfront Centre food court and shops (shared by the Fairmon hotel).  It has McDonald's, Starbucks, Fat Burger, Tim Horton's, and other local mom and pop stands.  Here you will find some affordable eats in this ritzy part of the town.  In the food court, you can also access two ATM's -- ScotiaBank and RBC Royal Bank.  No need to go out above ground to find a bank branch. 

In the food court, you can follow the signs which directly lead to the SkyTrain, Canada Line and Expo Line.  You can also take a shortcut to Gastown via exiting the station main entrance upstairs and also find the JapaDog stand!

You can also access the Expo line as well. If you go through the closest waterfront station which is just east of the parking garage exit, it's the Expo line but you can cut through to the Canada Line and Sea Bus which takes you to North Vancouver.

There's a 7-11 and RexAll drugstore on Seymour which is a few blocks away.  I'm pretty sure you can get the same stuff in the Waterfront Centre -- there's a sundry shop next to the food court. 

You are also an easy walk away from the famed sea wall, Robson St., Gastown, and tons of cool local pubs and restaurants which service the convention center crowds.

The hotel itself is well appointed.  Our room was spacious, clean, and boasted a fantastic harbor view. We were right by the pool so we were worried about being woken up early by other guests in the morning but we didn't have this problem.  Our stay was a very quiet and relaxing one though the chilly weather might have discouraged kids from the pool. 

Service was quite good. The front desk person, Asif, was great and offered to change our rooms when I expressed concerns about the pool noise in the am. Express check out was very easy.  You just fill out the card, drop it off at the front desk, and get a copy of your final bill via e-mail or snail mail. 

The ultimate downside? This hotel will nickel and dime you at every opportunity.  Internet access is billed by the hour, day, or week. There is complimentary wifi if you ask the front desk but this is not advertised until I wrote management about the lack of free wifi options.  Considering how much money spent per night, this hotel might consider offering a service complimentary at a business motel.  Even at the business center, all services required payment including computer usage.  The only thing that was free in the business center was the airline kiosk which allowed you to print your boarding pass. 

We managed to get around the wifi problem by sitting by the front door and taking advantage of free Starbucks wifi.",2015-05-18T07:47:46Z,235
683,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"This hotel feels like a Grande Dame towering high above the cruise ship terminal with sweeping views of both the Vancouver skyscrapers and the scenic bay but it is feeling its age and has a few issues that keep it from getting all 5 stars from me. The hotel is certainly huge and it has some beautiful open public spaces with elegant decor. But it is almost too big to feel like you are getting any type of personalized service. I noticed that there were a lot of lobby level areas that were gated off presumably because they were conference rooms not in use but the stark security gating and the empty corridors beyond gave it an unfriendly feel of unused space. I did have access to their Executive Lounge which really was the highlight of the hotel for me for its cozy feel and panoramic views high atop the hotel. Watching the seaplanes take off and land from 23 stories above the bay was very cool. The odd part of the experience is that they have this weird policy of providing you with 2 free alcoholic beverages per day but ask you to keep track of your consumption and to turn in a list of this every day at the self-service bar. I understand that they are watching the dollars in doing this but the rooms at the Executive Level are not cheap and I don't think that they are going to break the bank between giving away 2 vs. 3 drinks per day to the guest that is shelling out a fair amount of money to stay here. I have stayed in many Exec level accommodations around the world and this honor bar concept with a couple freebies but no more is something I have not run into before and comes across as very impersonal. Domestically in the US, the Exec honor bars are generally pay for everything as you go. Internationally, the Exec bar is only open for a couple of hours in the evening. It just felt odd that an ultra-luxury International hotel was asking the guests to keep track of their own tab and they were not shy about telling you this requirement each time you came into the lounge. It came across as a pre-event scolding for a bar policy that you had not yet violated. One other feature that was lacking was elevator security. I noticed that just outside the front door are plenty of aggressive pan-handlers because the hotel is in a prime sympathetic foreign tourist zone and while there is a doorman at the front of the hotel guarding it, he was not always present and there are at least 2 other ways to get into the hotel ground level that I found: through the adjacent doors of the convention center and from the parking ramp level elevators under the hotel that are openly accessible to everyone. Once on the ground level of the hotel, the elevator bank is wide open and requires no room key to get up to any floor of the place. I'm not a security freak but I do have pretty good situational awareness and the ease with which anyone could enter and access anywhere int he hotel is a bit concerning to me for a luxury property. Outside of the empty spaces, the quirky Exec Bar policy and the lack of elevator security, this hotel is beautiful and deserves a stay for the views alone.",2017-04-25T12:26:50Z,235
684,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"I booked this hotel based on the positive reviews, but was surprised to find the service severely lacking. We arrived early off our cruise to find the room not ready, which was to be expected. I had booked a club suite facing the harbor, and requested a bathtub. As I was in a wheelchair and was required to soak my injured foot. As we waited, we decided to tour the city and grab a bite to eat. The concierge recommended a sushi restaurant close to the hotel. Imagine my dismay when we arrived to find that there was no wheelchair access up to the restaurant. We spent the next twenty minutes going in and out of freight elevators trying to find an accessible way into the restaurant. Finally entering from the kitchen. Amusing at the time, but not the best recommendation for someone confined to a wheelchair. We arrived back at approximately 2pm to find that a room was ready. We arrived to find the room lacked a bathtub. Back up to the concierge. They apologized but said that the only other room in the hotel with a bathtub was still occupied, but they had a rush on it, for the room to be cleaned afterwords. 3:30pm the room is finally ready. We walk in to see....  a view of the roof. I cannot make this stuff up! At this point we were ready to leave. Almost our entire day had been waiting for rooms that were not what we paid for.  Only then did concierge finally admit, that they had a suite with a view and bathtub. A suite was what I had requested from the beginning when we first checked in, and was told it wasn't available!! When I mentioned that, all I got was a ""oh I am sorry."" The icing on the cake was when she took my credit card for incidentals. She assured me that the room was paid in advance and that only the incidentals would be placed on this card. Less than a week after the trip, the full amount of the hotel was placed on that very card. When I called to have it moved, I was told that it was too late, but ""sorry!""
Also if you are looking for a hotel bar, this isn't the hotel for you, we wandered around at about 5pm and everything in the hotel was closed. The Fairmont across the street however, had an amazing bar with a very personable and attentive bartender. Next time we will be staying there.",2019-07-11T04:33:48Z,235

687,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"We went for thanksgiving dinner at coal harbour bar. 
Worst service in the whole world. 
We were waiting for main dish after  appetizer about 30 mins . Just asked Server how long will take for next dish. 
She taught us "" This is not McDonald! We make all freshly . Never been to this kinds of dinner?"" 
I was shocked. And I just told my friend If they will make whole dish ...turkey might take more than one hour? And she overheard our conversation then yelled at us "" you guys not been here for one hour yet!"" 
 
It was three course set menu. I don't want to ruin our thanksgiving night any more so we skipped dessert and even finish main dish.

I saw in the receipt her name is ""Lori"" .
I will never go this place if she works.

689,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"This is my favorite Vancouver hotel as a local to stay at when I want to be in town. Being that it is clearly a gold standard of all hotels, I will add some details that are not clearly obvious by just looking at the website.
It was clear they were really struggling with having one of 4 elevators running but they were pleasant about it and we waited . 
A few things that were a little off : to use the Internet you have to pay $10-40. Seems a little much when you are already paying $400 for the room for one night. 
It's really the most beautiful view and place to stay . The view even from the bath tub is stunning. We checked out late and got to stay by the pool until 4pm the next day . Literally the best part of the stay . 
Great service, beautiful surroundings and do yourself a favour ...the hotel adjoins to a tunnel to jugo juice . If you don't want to opt for the fancy breakfast, you can have beat juice by the pool for 7.99. 
Best hotel !",2019-08-08T02:31:29Z,235

Join their Discovery club to get free water, wifi and upgrades! They let us check in earlier than any hotel ever has, 11:00am! Amazing roof top pool and hot tub open till midnight!! 

RANDALL the bellmen was literally one of the nicest men we've ever met, he was informative, personable and honest!!!! 

Only two down falls....one was the food at the hotel whether brunch, dinner or late night was extremely expensive....we dined elsewhere. Also although the amenities were outstanding, the bathroom was disappointing as it looked like any other motel bathroom.",2017-12-30T05:19:03Z,235
691,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"This is my second stay at the Pan Pacific Vancouver. The location cannot possibly get any better. I wouldn't ever stay at a different hotel in Vancouver for that very reason. 

The hotel is practically in the water. Definitely worth it to upgrade to a room with a view. While all of the rooms have a ""view"" the designated rooms have incredible views of the whole harbor. Worth every penny. 

The only suggestion I would have, is to assure at booking that you're in their larger standard room. There are two types, one has a couch and small seating area, the other is quite small. It almost felt like a cruise ship room. It was tolerable given the incredible views, but had I known the difference in size and comfort was so significant, I would have requested the larger room. 

The pool is adorable and up a little high over the water, the staff is great and very friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel.",2015-11-27T07:32:06Z,235
692,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,After our cruise was canceled I booked through hotels.com and was looking to cancel our reservation. Hotels.com reached out to the pan Pacific hotel where they informed us that they would only switch the date and no refunds would be given. They further stated that we should've booked directly through them and they would've been able to help us. Rebooking was not an option as we do not know when the ports will be reopening for cruises and we are under a stay in place order.,2020-03-30T14:02:18Z,235
693,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,Very grand hotel in the most perfect location.  Fantastic views of the harbor.  Located literally on top of the cruise terminal making it most convenient for cruisers to park here for a night.  In room decor a tad dated but very comfortable.  Lobby bar takes advantage of the view and makes it comfortable to sit there and enjoy drinks for a long time.  Service is wonderful.   This is definitely my go to hotel when in Vancouver.,2019-05-25T18:18:55Z,235
694,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"Not to brag, but I've stayed in a lot of hotels. I've had a travel bug for 30 years now and I show no signs of being cured. I live to live in hotels. And now, this hotel is at the top of my list.

This is by far one of the most amazing hotels I've stayed in. It is huge, extremely convenient, and the views are breathtaking. It is right on the water so you can see the sea planes take off and land, or the cruise ships come in to port. The concierge is extremely helpful but there is also an information/ticket stand right outside of the hotel lobby. This is where we purchased most of our tickets for things to see/do around Vancouver. 

The sky train is literally a 2 minute walk from the hotel, or the free Capilano shuttle and free Grouse Mountain shuttle also stops right out front of the hotel. This is also a stop for the hop-on-hop-off tour bus. Everything is just so convenient!

As for the hotel rooms, they are huge. And the bathroom, wow, don't even get me started! Everything was so clean and fresh you could stay in your room your entire stay but then you would miss out on everything Vancouver had to offer!

Step out of the hotel and walk a couple minutes to your right and there are a bunch of stores and restaurants. Really everything is in walking distance. There is also a Starbucks right downstairs for you caffeine addicts.

I couldn't say anything negative about this hotel. It is wonderful and hopefully I'll be back soon!",2016-08-25T01:49:45Z,235
695,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,Great hotel the breakfast buffet is fantastic. The rooms are clean and big and the view of the rooms are incredible.

696,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"This hotel, though nice, could use some updating. The bathroom in our suite was dated and felt slightly unclean. The main room was nice--underwhelming--but nice. Excellent proximity to local transportation and the waterfront. My issue, however, is that they gouge you for simple amenities that should be standard at this point (e.g. Wi-Fi, business center use, etc). Also, most of the staff was not as friendly or warm as I've experienced at other hotels. I would return, but it wouldn't be my first choice.",2019-03-13T04:26:53Z,235
697,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"The rooms were beautiful and the facility was very clean! I stayed in a harbor view room and it had the best views. You do hear the Sea Planes as they take off, so if you are a late sleeper that might affect you a little bit.

Great location.",2018-03-01T18:31:30Z,235
698,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"My favourite hotel in Vancouver if willing to splurge. The hotel is well situated to all kinds of attractions and top restaurants. It's also always bustling with people as there is a convention centre and cruise ship port as part of the hotel. The harbour views are exceptional as you can see the whole harbour across to North Vancouver without any obstructions. 

By reserving one of the Pacific Club rooms, you have access to many extra amenities such as a dedicated lounge and concierge service, complimentary coffee, teas, juices, soft drinks, water, and freshly baked treats all day. A West Coast Breakfast and Evening Hors D'oeuvres are included as part of the Pacific Club experience. 

The attention to small details is also very welcome. Our kids had gone swimming and it appears the staff had noticed. Upon our return, we found two small robes laid out on the bed. Even the nightly turn down service was something included that I did not expect but was a nice touch!

I never thought it would be as useful as it was but having access to a dedicated lounge for snacks and drinks all day was absolutely incredible. Finish a workout and craving a banana? A quick stop for some cold bottled water? Don't feel like instant coffee and want some brewed Starbucks? All available by just walking to the lounge. I even spoke to the dedicated concierge more than I've ever conversed with any other hotel concierges. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and helpful for getting around the city and pre-booking tickets to attractions for us. 

I highly recommend this hotel if you want the highest level of service and a most comfortable stay.",2019-08-06T23:21:03Z,235
699,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"I love this hotel.  As an event coordinator I have organized events in almost every venue there is downtown.  The banquet staff are amazing. 

I have probably had well over 400 events there over the years and there is not a single thing I could say was not done perfectly.  (Or if it wasn't it was taken care of behind the scenes because I never saw it.)  

They know exactly how I like things and they deliver it that way.  

The food is fabulous, the staff are the best.  Many of them have been at the hotel for years - you can tell the management treat the staff well and respect them.  

They are always my first choice.",2020-02-14T21:53:25Z,235
700,Pan Pacific Vancouver,3.8,"The Husband and I were taking a cruise to Alaska out of Vancouver and decided to come to the city a day early to see the town.

The hotel is conveniently located a short drive from the airport (a straight shot, but you have to drive quite a few miles down a really long street through the city) and right on the waterfront next to where our cruise ship was taking off from.

When I say next to where our ship was taking off from I mean RIGHT next to where our ship was taking off. We could see our ship right outside our window and didn't even have to leave our hotel to board. They even took our baggage to the ship for us from our room!

Our room was a basic room. The bed was extremely comfortable and it had a great view of the city and the harbor. We got a ""city view"" room but could still see the water. I think all rooms have an amazing view!

I'm addition to being super convenient to the departing cruise ships the hotel is also within walking distance to a plethora of great restaurants and attractions! We especially enjoyed walking along the harbor towards the convention center and walking down a few miles to Stanley Park. Gorgeous! 

We paid about $300 for our room for the middle of the week in May. I'm sure there are deals out there to be had, but you will be paying a premium for the views and location!",2014-05-17T05:13:11Z,235

When I was told that we would be staying at the cruise ship terminal, I was expecting a run down, nightmare hotel.  When I walked into my room, I almost fell over.  I somehow ended up with a premier corner room with a wall full of windows that overlook the harbor and mountains.  OMG, I was in LOVE!  I swear, I could sit and watch the float planes take off and land all day long.  In fact, I'm sitting in my nice chaise lounge looking out the window as I type.  I'm in heaven.

Oh, and I'm also lounging in the most comfortable robe of all time, with a great big smile on my face because I left for a cruise and the hotel honored my request for the same room type on the way back.  I swear, I could live here.  Add all of this to a helpful and friendly staff, great location, fabulous pool deck, very reasonable room rates, and Aveda bath products and you've got a winner.  

I know I probably can't move in (I'm sure security would remove me), but I guess I have something to look forward to the next time I'm in Vancouver.  If you stay here, definitely make sure you get this room, even if it costs a few extra bucks.",2009-06-15T16:31:04Z,235

Pros:
1. Location is central and it's right by the water. Most touristy areas are within walking distance. We even walked to Stanley Park and Vancouver Aquarium via Seawall. 
2. We stayed on the 8th floor and the pool was on the 8th floor. The pool and jacuzzi are outdoor with fantastic views
3. Lobby and room are modern. Room was spacious and very clean. 
4. Elevator takes you directly to the cruise ship level (CS level) so it was convenient to check out and go to the cruise ship terminal. 
5. VIEWS VIEW VIEWS!!!! Great location if you're traveling with your significant other. 

Cons:
1. Expensive. Our room cost $245 a night (before taxes) for two nights in mid June 2013.
2. You have to pay for internet
3. Late night room service menu is limited. We had a late flight and wanted something to eat before bed. Menu only had quick items such as sandwiches. We ordered chicken tenders and a grilled chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and the total came out to $50 (including tax and tips). 
4. Bed is a little too soft for my taste. You kind of sink into it.

A bit pricey but you get what you pay for.  Family plan includes great buffet breakfast for four.  Weather was beautiful in August. 

Cruise liners dock on both sides of hotel and they will directly transfer the bags to the ships for you.  The Fly Over Canada attraction is also there - quite spectacular audio visual motion ride into the very majestic scenery of the country - a must see thing even if you already experienced at Disney World in Florida.

This is a great hotel in the heart of down town Vancouver. Alot of shopping a great place for dinner and drinks and nightlife. It is right next to Canada Place and the port where all the cruse ships come in. 

We got a great package off of travelocity that included breakfast buffet for both days, and passage to Victoria island via BC Ferries. 

The suite was one of the best I have stayed in and had a perfect view of Vancouver harbour. The room was very stylish and comfortable. 

The Ferrie to Victoria was a blast and between one of the numerous islands on the way we seen a Bald Eagle fly right over us on the 4th of July! That's not a bad Independence day if you out of the US.

I am a Expedia gold member so they updated my room and gave me a bottle of wine without me asking. Hotels never want to honor perks like this without you begging them for it. I suggest choosing valet parking which is located on the back side of the hotel. Everyone is knowledgeable of the area. Check out Karma lounge and Mansion nightclub if you're feeling social. We did bottle service at Mansion and it was well worth having to take a fast elevator back to you're room when you're done.,2023-11-15T07:29:52Z,23
711,Paradox Hotel Vancouver,4.2,"This hotel is so absolutely beautiful! 

Our room had floor to ceiling windows with an amazing view of the city. The room came with free water, coffee and even a iPad that you can use. Very high tech and modern room. 

We even had a bottle of wine delivered to us when we arrived!! 

They offer fresh fruit every day at the front desk. Second floor has a beautiful restaurant/lounge. 

Just a couple blocks from downtown so within minutes, you will be in the heart of everything. 

Valet was amazing and quick as well! Will definitely stay here next time we are in Vancouver!!",2023-06-26T02:44:35Z,23
712,Paradox Hotel Vancouver,4.2,"This hotel had good service, but then they had these stuffed animals on the beds. We thought they were free, but they actually had a sneaky price tag on the back. The bar was also out in the open, waiting for susceptible customers to take a drink. Then, they charge you once you check out. Overall, this hotel is scummy but the service is ok.",2024-03-28T16:24:24Z,23
713,Paradox Hotel Vancouver,4.2,"My experience at the Paradox was truly a dream come true. My fiancé and I chose this wonderful hotel as the final stop on our week-long engagement vacation, and it exceeded all expectations. Despite having stayed at two other luxury hotels earlier in the week, this one truly stood out and captured our hearts.

The staff's warmth and attentiveness left a lasting impression on us. Their kindness, accommodating nature, and genuine sense of welcome made our stay truly exceptional. It meant the world to us, especially since it was my fiancé's first time in Vancouver. Thanks to the Paradox, Vancouver will forever hold a special place in our hearts as a place of unforgettable memories.

Our room was a haven of comfort and style, complete with an amazing view that took our breath away. The overall accommodations were nothing short of outstanding, earning an unequivocal A+ from us. We will be returning to the Paradox.",2023-08-15T18:37:03Z,23
714,Paradox Hotel Vancouver,4.2,"Very Friendly - Very Classy - Very Hip ! 
We decided to spend our final night in Vancouver at this hotel ... great decision !   Room is beautiful and the location is amazing !  Walking distance to everything relevant here I. The heart of Vancouver.  You have an incredible bar/restaurant (Karma) and Mott 22 is next door ... what a fun time !",2023-05-21T20:43:21Z,23
715,Paradox Hotel Vancouver,4.2,"Well. This was a pleasant surprise. I was worried when we walked in through ""Karma"" the bar/nightclub and it was hopping. Definite meat market and hookup bar. I didn't like that vibe. Quickly walked through, and it was modern, clean, open, and reminded me a lot of Vegas hotels (without the awful smoke smell.) Really beautiful and high end. So we went to check in, and the front desk experience was also great. The guy who checked us in asked if we were celebrating anything and we said our anniversary. He gave us a free drink card for Karma Bar & it also had 10% off food. He also said they would send something special up from the kitchen which was so kind and great service!! 

So we headed up to our room. And it was beautiful. GREAT views of the city, modern, upscale and clean. There is a main control panel on the wall near the door for temperature, lighting (you can turn it ALL on and off there,) and the drapes and shades can be opened and closed there. THAT said, small aside as you can also do that IN BED with buttons on the nightstand on BOTH sides!!! 

Then there is the bathroom, heated floors y'all. I think this is SO much more common in Canada than the US but oh I sure loved them in the bathroom!!! Every aspect of the room was thought of for guest comfort. It had plenty of storage, the bed was firm and had cozy covers and pillows and it was QUIET. I say that as we were on the 15th floor, so I don't know if floor 3 gets loud because of the nightclub, or 4...but 15 was so quiet that we slept until 10:30-11 our first morning out of pure LIFE exhaustion. 

We didn't need housekeeping, so you can just hit the privacy button or put the do not disturb sign up. 

I couldn't have asked for more with the comfort and cleanliness and QUIET. I feel truly refreshed and happy checking out today. Would HIGHLY recommend!!!",2022-10-08T15:45:04Z,23
716,Paradox Hotel Vancouver,4.2,"this hotel is AMAZING. it was my first time in vancouver and i feel like i hit the jackpot. as soon as i arrived, charlie welcomed me and i even got a complimentary upgrade. i was like yassssss!

717,Paradox Hotel Vancouver,4.2,"For my husband's first trip to Vancouver, I wanted to book a nice hotel, so I booked Paradox Hotel based off the pictures and good reviews. 

For our room, I booked the Paradox King Balcony, which felt super spacious and I loved the modern and stylish interior. Unfortunately for us, it was way too cold/rainy/windy to use the balcony to its full extent, haha. Also, we were on the seventh floor, and the direction we were facing wasn't the greatest in my opinion, as it didn't provide much of a view. The room had a super neat touch pad that controls everything from the shades and blinds, lighting, and temperature. Both nightstands also had options to control the shades, blinds, and lighting. On top of one of the nightstands was an iPad for us to borrow for general browsing/Netflix/etc. which I thought was SUPER nice of them to provide! The room also comes with a mini-fridge in case you wanted to chill your drinks or keep any snacks in there. 

The bathroom was advertised as having ""heated floors,"" but in our bathroom, maybe only 1/3 of the tiles were actually heated (not sure if that's a purposeful design thing or if some of the tiles no longer heat up correctly). The tiles that were actually heated, felt really nice after a cold day out or right after stepping out of the shower. We did really enjoy the rain shower, and the hotel has complimentary Fig+Yarrow shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. I really liked that these were wall-mounted, rather than coming in small, tiny bottles. 

The only other downside of the room, is that the walls felt really thin, or at least not soundproofed well. Often at night, we could hear loud noises coming from upstairs, and if anyone is in the hallway talking, you could hear them loudly and clearly in our room. It wasn't a super big deal, but does take away the ""luxury"" feel of the room. 

Amenities wise, the pool isn't much to look at. It's pretty small and not visually appealing. The fitness center is a little better, and they provide towels for your workout. The treadmills especially look very modern and updated, with all of them having large electronic screens. The gym isn't very big however, so the treadmills are placed very close together (just an observation). 

Details about the room and amenities aside, the service here was phenomenal and unmatched to any prior hotels I've been at. You can stay in contact with them via text, and I was able to text them questions I had about the room as well as general questions about Vancouver. They were always courteous and replied promptly to any questions I had. The housekeepers did a fantastic job tidying our room, and even left a cute note after servicing the room! They were generous with supplying us with water bottles, especially after seeing how many we used up, and they even have a 
""turn-down"" service, where they came around in the evening and gave us candies and more water bottles. They had umbrellas for us to use as we trekked around rainy Vancouver, and every person we encountered in the hotel was so kind and helpful! I seriously cannot commend the staff enough for the exceptional customer service we were provided, and I would stay here again solely because of how well we were treated here! 

Is this hotel perfect? No. But the level and quality of service provided here more than make up for the downsides we encountered while staying at this hotel. Thank you Paradox Hotel for an fantastic experience and we hope to stay here again in the future!",2023-04-14T00:22:48Z,23

Mei at the front desk was so friendly and provided a great check-in experience. This hotel is new and they thought i'd everything. The room came with an iPad that allowed us to stream to the TV. A small touch screen pad controlled the lights, the temperature, shades, drapes and more. The view from the windows and balcony we're breathtaking.

729,Paradox Hotel Vancouver,4.2,"This is the second time we stayed at Paradox Hotel. The bar was set high ever since our first experience and each time they exceeded our expectations. The first time we stayed at paradox, we were a little bit hesitant as they were still under construction. What caught our eye was that the hotel was pet friendly which allows our furry friend to journey with us. Upon checking in, the hotel staff had been amazing! Valet service was top notch as they were courteous and speedy in assisting us. 

The check-in process was immediate and there was no wait whatsoever. Special thanks to the front desk staff who also offered tips on local hotspots to enhance our experience. There were several restaurant and dining area which was hidden beneath our noses. 

We thought the hotel might have been loud as our first stay was during their renovation, but our room was on the 19th floor which kept us away from all the noise. It was so tranquil, we completely forgot it was under renovations. The room offered a city view which oversees Downtown Vancouver. During the evening, the city lights up and offers a breathtaking view. In addition to being so high up, the noise posed by the bustling streets of Vancouver was absent. 

Fast forward to 2023, we booked another stay and was expecting top notch service. To our surprise, they exceeded our expectation and offered another amazing experience. Similarly to the first experience, valet was immediate and took our luggage's to the room. The front desk and staff (there were about 3 this time) and they were extremely courteous. I wish we caught the name of the front desk staff who checked us in, as she was extremely helpful and courteous! The local spots she recommended at Granville Island was stellar! This time we booked the executive suite with our puppy Meeko. The room was spacious, well kept, and offered amazing breath-taking sights of the city. One of the highlights was having a balcony on the 19th floor which let us enjoy the crisp air Vancouver had to offer. The morning time coffee on the balcony with our puppy was one of the most peaceful we've had when we traveled. Although it rained on the second day, the positioning of the balcony still allowed us to stay dry and enjoy the ambience the city offered. 
We especially enjoyed the that the room was spacious enough to have a dining area separate from the bedroom. We enjoyed having dinner together and keeping any scent of food in another area. The bathroom was especially well kept and well stocked. My wife and I especially enjoyed the tub which was spacious enough for 2. What caught us by surprise was and brought out our inner child was the rubber ducky. 

Our puppy travels with us on a constant basis and our hotel selections primarily consist of pet friendly lodging accommodations. Seldom do we highly recommend a hotel or find a hotel worthy enough for a review, but this hotel set a new standard in luxury hotels in the city of Vancouver. Even then, they exceeded expectations and we look forward to our next adventure here. 

Meeko especially appreciates the treats during his stay (Salmon flavor), having a large bed, and all the pet the amenities offered.",2023-03-21T05:28:58Z,23

731,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"Our family has made Blue Horizon our home base in Vancouver for years. It's a good location if you want to explore Robson and the West End/Stanley Park areas.

They've done a nice job updating it, especially the little pool/sauna/spa area. We appreciated the Nespresso machine, too-- but we had to buy our own creamer at the London Drugs across the street.

This visit we upgraded to a one-bedroom suite and it worked perfectly for our two teens and my husband & I. The kids each had their own space in the living room (daybed and sofa bed), and my husband and I had a nice bedroom with a king bed. The bonus is that these rooms are only on the 29th & 30th floors, so we had a nice view. 

The wet sauna was something my husband was looking forward to, and it's very nicely updated. Unfortunately, it just gets too hot rather quickly. The other guests in the pool area agreed with us. There's no shutoff switch or temperature controls, so once it's too hot-- not much can be done except to wait. The spa was perfect, and the little lap pool was also a nice refresher.

There's also plenty of gym equipment available, which seemed updated but not brand new. 

The room was very comfortable and well appointed. Easy to relax and unwind and enjoy city/harbor/bay views depending on which side you're on. Water pressure was a bit weak, but we're wondering if that's a 30th floor thing? It wasn't terrible, just took longer to rinse the shampoo out. 

Glad to be back to familiar experiences again, and the Blue Horizon is still quite pleasant.",2022-10-18T16:42:02Z,137

First night we arrived at 10 PM since our flight got delayed for 3 h and there were problem with the toilet in the room, they tried to fix it until 12 midnight but they couldn't so they changed our room to double queen. I didn't like inconvenience that it caused also we couldn't go to bed until 00-30 am because of packing & moving to other room. They charge us for queen room first night which was 20 CAD cheaper. I didn't like how it was handled but in the end of the day they gave us our room back. A lot of packing and unpacking & moving to the rooms just wasted too much time. I was upset that they didn't reimburse for that in any way. I think it should be handled much better. Also the fact that it was my birthday and I didn't received any card or any note from the hotel... But otherwise everything else was good. Was surprised steam room still wasn't working.",2022-07-25T22:20:37Z,137
734,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"""Memories""

'Blue Horizon Hotel' provided my lodging during several stays in downtown Vancouver when out this way on work and pleasure trips from my homes in Atlantic Canada at the time.

The Robson Street area of the city was a big favourite of mine during these times, and the 'Blue Horizon' so convenient and handy t0 everything, and just an easy walk away to other areas of the city.

My first discovery of the hotel was made via a business trip.  I called ahead for a reservation, and so enjoyed the  room and view, and the hotel's location, made a point of seeking out the same view each time I stayed there.  Back then, Robson Street and other nearby streets had not been crammed with high-rise condos, blocking the views to Vancouver Harbour, and the north shore mountains.  I always caught rooms on the back side of the hotel, they were quieter than those out front, and when I was in my room, I was able to enjoy the wonderful views and sights of the seaside of Vancouver at that time.  Some real ""picture postcard"" scenes.

Several of my stays were during mostly pleasure trips, and I really enjoyed staying there at these times.  My Mother and friends became part of my stays, and we enjoyed several get togethers downtown.  At that time Robson, Davie, and Denman were our most-enjoyed streets, and we had places we enjoyed dining, drinking, and such, along with walks to English Bay and Stanley Park.  The hotel made for a handy base to these activities, and such a great spot to relax at the other times while in the city.

Service was friendly, and always very accommodating.  The rooms were clean and comfortably furnished, and each had a kitchenette, which was always a used and much-enjoyed aspect of my stays.  I shopped at nearby stores, markets, and such, and always found some great take outs for dining back at my room when desired.

The 'Blue Horizon' was 'my' place to stay on a good number of occasions, and such a fond favourite during several years of travel.",2020-12-04T16:27:57Z,137
735,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"Great location with (paid) parking.  The hotel is in the heart of Robson St, which is a vibrant and bustling higher end street. Lots of cool restaurants, bakeries and shops just outside the hotel.  Also outside the entrance is the shuttle to the capalano suspension bridge (a must see) and hop-on-hop off bus.  Most rooms have a decent view.  We were on the 14th floor and the view was magnificent and the balcony was a refreshing retreat with a cup of Nespresso (included in the room).  The room itself was nothing special.   For the price, kind small with a desk and TV chair.  Bathroom was quite small and luckily we're small people so we had no problem getting in and out of the very narrow shower entrance.  My biggest complaint was the transition time from hot to cold water at the sink.  Usually it's the other way around, but for this place it took several minutes for the water to go from hot to cold.  Weird...and annoying.  I think next time I will find some places with better value.  However, I would still give this place 4 stars.",2022-09-06T22:04:27Z,137

737,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"I'm giving this place four stars because we booked a Superior room and ended up on the 26th floor with a killer view. The views were so amazing we had booked two nights but stayed for a third. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom is updated. The internet is free. The location is fabulous (there are oodles of cheap, authentic diverse restaurants right outside your door). But the views--the views (of the city and the ocean from the side we were on) make it a four star place.

Here are the drawbacks:

1. We had to pay $3.99 for a toothbrush
2. Parking is $18 a night
3. No rollaway beds

It's also loud, but we ran the a/c and brought a noise machine/earplugs so we slept soundly.",2018-05-07T04:15:41Z,137
738,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"Blue Horizon is a little bit of heaven! Great staff, starting with all the tips and coupons offered by Kartier at the front desk upon check-in. The 26th floor room was large and had a mind-blowing view. Three elevators minimized the wait time to get to the palatial heaven.

Good location. Convenient, with great sites within walking distance, including Stanley Park. Good restaurants nearby. Incredible gelato directly across the street! Great breakfast and service at the hotel's restaurant, Abode. If you're a shopper, you'll be in heaven. There's even a money changing spot one block over. Reasonably priced parking with convenient spots available. 

Not inexpensive, but this felt like a great value at the price. Especially compared to everything I saw while doing comparison shopping on several sites. I got a good rate on Booking dot com.",2017-07-30T07:33:45Z,137
739,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"Clean rooms and an excellent location right in the heart of Robson Street so you can shop, eat, and drink til you drop.  The hotel itself has a shared public parking garage but it isn't very big car friendly.  I drive a 17 honda pilot and managed to squeeze into a tight space.  Anything larger than that would be a struggle.

Staff is very nice and informative - the room we had, had a view of the parking lot on the 3rd level.  It was a handicap accessible room so everything was very spacious.  Biggest gripe is that from the top floor parking lot, to get to the rooms, you have to go down a short flight of stairs in a very tight hallway. so it's not handicap friendly or stroller friendly. 

Overall - i love this place for the location more than anything else.  Room rates are reasonable for it's location as well.  As it is mentioned above, right in the heart of it all, shopping is outside your doorstep, the indoor shopping centre is about half a mile down the street, plenty of night life over on Granville is a few blocks away.  And the nice part is its not loud at night at all.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Vancouver BC!",2019-08-30T05:04:24Z,137

While it physically is a nice hotel after booking in advanced they were not able to accommodate us as we asked and only told us after we arrived that we would not be on the same floor while being rude about it. When I complained to the front desk staff about not calling me back when I was trying to contact them from my room. I was threatened by the lady at the front desk that she would call the police on me.

Our room was very quiet and the bed was extremely comfortable. We arrived at 10am and, knowing that check in was at 3pm, we planned on parking our car in the lot (which is open to the public but patrolled regularly) and wandering around until then. When I went to the reception desk to get a parking pass for the weekend, I was told that our room was ready for us, which was a nice surprise! I don't understand what people are complaining about in regards to the speed of the elevator. We stayed on the top floor and had no issues with wait times. We had breakfast in the restaurant downstairs one morning, which was the only let-down in my eyes. Though, we really shouldn't have been surprised by what we received for $8. There are a ton of great breakfast options within walking distance of the hotel, which I would suggest you take advantage of instead of the sad breakfast that we had.

Oh, they will send someone up to ""re`set"" the thermostat, but it will only be a couple of degrees, and not sufficient.  Our friends traveling with us had to eventually change rooms due to the excessive heat in their room.  Reception suggested they sleep with their balcony door open, but the street noise was too great making it impossible to get to sleep.  It is irritating to pay what we did and not have control of your AC.  Shame on management thinking they know what is a ""safe level of cooling for the guest"".

Stayed there a couple of weekends ago. We got the family suite to get the 2 bathrooms so didn't stay in a standard room. I like the hotel and definitely the location is great.

Pros: 
1. Every room has a balcony and awesome view. Be sure to get a high floor to get the best view.
2. Room was nice and clean. Had King size bed. frig and flatscreen tv.
Being eco/recycle aware, they had the soap/shampoo in a dispenser stuck to the wall. If you want to use your own, be sure to bring your own. Otherwise it's ok for the 1 night we stayed there.
3. Right on Robson street. Can walk everywhere to stores, restaurants and Stanley Park. Red Trolley is right outside the hotel if you want to take it to other areas. 
4. Gym is ok for me but it is small (1 bike, treadmill and an elliptical) with the pool right next to it so if chlorine bugs you, you might not want to exercise there. 
5. They held our bags since our room wasn't ready and held it the next day until 3pm. Parking is $15 and can stay there til 3pm the day of checkout.
6. Staff were all very pleasant.

Cons:
1. We arrived around 2:30. Traffic was insane because of some construction work going on. Our room was not ready. Check in is 3pm but the front desk told us to come back at 3:45pm so we walked around a bit. Really????
2. Elevator is really small and slow. Have patience.
3. When we checked in, there were alot of people in the front lobby. The lobby is small and there was no system or method to the madness. A guy cut me off and the front desk couldn't tell who was next. someone should have taken control once they saw the lobby was jammed.
4. Ok as mentioned everything is walking distance but be prepared to walk. Stanley Park is about 20 minutes to just get to the perimeter of the park, also another 10 minutes to hit the Aquarium and don't forget all the walking you may do when you hit the park trails or the aquarium or if you take a wrong turn which we did.
5. Don't leave anything in your car if you park it in the hotel. There's even a sign that warns you of break-ins.",2012-03-29T04:42:55Z,137
748,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"I would like to give this place more stars, but unfortunately 3 is probably the most accurate.... I'd like to give it more stars because the staff was very nice, helpful, and accommodating. BUT, unfortunately, my stay was not a 4-5 star experience because I did not sleep well. Let's just say, this place is NOT a good option for the light sleeper. The walls are very thin, so on the first night of our stay in Vancouver, we heard EVERYTHING going on in the room next door. Fortunately, this was not anything that would give me nightmares, but we did hear the people next to us putting things down on their tables, going to the bathroom, and watching TV, etc. On the up side, the hotel staff was very apologetic the next day when I went to the front desk to vent my frustrations (this was my first time telling a hotel that I wanted to leave after the first night). They ended up upgrading us to a larger room on a different floor, and we decided to give it a try because our stuff was already there and unpacked....it was a better experience, but still a bit louder than I would like. 

The negatives: 
-there are only 6 or 7 rooms per floor which means everything is near the elevators. 
-Room walls are thin
-Beds, bathrooms, other accommodations are pretty good, but not great
-WIFI worked for only the first few hours of our stay

The positives:
-reasonably priced ($110/night)
-great location on Robson downtown, near lots of shops and some good places to eat
-hotel staff was friendly

Unfortunately in the end, I don't think I would stay here again during my next trip to Vancouver (which I do plan on taking, because I loved the city itself)!",2011-08-21T18:55:27Z,137

There is an extra $17/day charge for parking.We checked in after waiting for a bit while the customer service staff were too busy on the phone with other customers without any acknowledgement of us waiting. Perhaps they were short staffed for that shift. The lobby is pretty nice, contemporary style and has a nice coffee shop. The room was nice and clean as advertised , with nice view of Vancouver.

751,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"This hotel is right on Robson Street centrally located to plenty of shops and restaurants. Checking in process was smooth and staff were able to check my whole family in with our multiple reservations seamlessly. Many of the local taxis know this hotel which made getting around easier. This hotel is a tall building and sometimes may take a while to get an elevator on you floor, especially during checkout. 

Our room had a balcony overseeing Robson Street which is beautiful day or night. The shower is a dream with dual shower heads. Provided shampoo, lotion, conditioner, and body wash. The body wash is a bit exfoliating and didn't use it on our stay for that reason. They have Keurig and tea kettle in the room! They also have robes which i didnt notice until our last day here so didn't use them :(
The closets are extremely spacious and can fit various luggages. 

They have an attached restaurant which is very convenient (and a bit overpriced). Wait for Happy Hour!

753,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"Upon checking in after a very long drive from Seattle, WA we were assigned our room with 2 queen beds. We asked for a room with a king bed and were informed they ""upgraded"" us. The hotel is a maze to find the rooms after parking in the structure with what is likely the world's smallest parking spaces. After arriving to our room and drawing back the curtains we were extremely disappointed that our view out both sets of windows was the top of a dirty roof. We then decided to rest a bit after such a long drive and were unable to do so because the rooms are so loud and what sounded like construction was going on the entire time. 

The beds were extremely uncomfortable and both my husband and I experienced back pain after sleeping in them. Every time someone opened or closed their door, walked down the hall, or got off the elevator we were disturbed because the rooms allow all noise to penetrate the walls.

The bathroom is probably the smallest bathroom I've ever been in. I'm very tiny and had trouble showering. My husband, who is 6 foot, had a horrible time trying to shower.

I would not recommend anyone stay in this hotel and in fact while exploring the city the Holiday Inn seemed to be a better choice which in my opinion is sad.",2016-04-18T19:01:10Z,137

The first night we came back for our long and exhausted outing and we came back with unclean room. 
They are 2 side of the sign "" do not disturb"" and "" please make up room"" And they argue both side was the same when we called front desk for towels.
The house keeper came up and we showed him the sign and he said ""ooo"" not even apologized.

758,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"One of the best--if not THE BEST--places I've ever stayed! 

I went during off-season, so was warned well in advance that there was construction going on, but was reassured they'd make it as unobtrusive as possible, restricted to the hours of 9-5. Frankly, I hardly noticed. 

When I arrived, not only did they give me the least expensive pricing possible, they upgraded me for free to a queen-double-bed corner room, meaning almost two wall's worth of windows for a WATER view. (28th floor.) Stunning.(Thank you, Paul!!) 

The room itself was neat, had a Kerug coffee maker, refrigerator, and my best friend, the water kettle. I ended up spending an entire day working out of the room and it was the perfect place to get everything done, while not going stir crazy. Housekeeping politely left me to my own devices, but did check in on me later in the evening just to ensure I had everything I needed.

The day I checked out, I had a few hours to kill before my flight. The concierge (a lovely, lovely Asian woman whose name I didn't get, but whose level of customer service and sheer amazingness must be noted) held on to my luggage for me and said they'd be happy to help me call a taxi when I got back. Well, when I got back, not only did she remember my luggage and had it ready to go without me saying a word, the taxi was already waiting for me curbside, too. Seriously, AMAZING!

The place itself is perfectly situated on Robson Street; close walking distance to Gastown and tons of food and shopping. They have a pool and gym (two places I never actually made it to, but thought a lot about), and there's a restaurant inside. 

I had such a great stay here and highly recommend it!",2017-02-12T04:37:44Z,137

The staff is friendly. The rooms are clean and big. Our rooms had a great view of Robson. We would definitely stay here again.

I know that there is no complimentary breakfast, which is something a lot of hotels do, but don't stress. Just grab breakfast at the hotel restaurant OR simply walk outside to numerous breakfast joints.",2019-12-30T05:59:52Z,137

I called the hotel ahead of time to learn the rates if each room and when I mentioned the offer on Yelp, the gentleman at the front desk advised me to come in and negotiate the rate in person. 

Sadly, this gentleman had left just minutes before we arrived and I was faced to deal with two inexperienced front desk clerks with zero awareness of customer service.

When I presented the Yelp offer, they looked at us strangely and said, ""we've never seen anything like this before."" ... Well... We didn't make it up. 

We spent 10 minutes going back and forth on why they should/shouldn't honor the price. They tried calling a sales rep who knew nothing about the offer and concluded that the best price they could give us was $280 CAD. It was too far a stretch to be considered a deal and for that price, we wanted to stay at a nicer hotel. Needless to say, we left disappointed.",2016-08-31T13:05:59Z,137
764,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"I love this hotel.
Not the newest or nicest.
But my favorite.

Clock is ticking on my 100 reviews in 2013, so I am going back into the memory banks for this one (and probably a couple others here soon).  Stayed here twice now when I was a broke student,  so never on my dime. But if it was on my dime, I don't think it would have broken the bank as bad as some other places which would not have been as good. Nowhere near as expensive or fancy as the Fairmont Pacific Rim, but I imagine that the views at the Blue Horizon are better as you are smack dab in the heart of the city here.

Location on Robson Street puts you right in the best part of the city.  Think I was on the 17th floor once and the 19th floor the other time.  The views are absolutely amazing!  Every room is essentially a corner unit, if memory serves me correctly.  You are surrounded by high-rises and mountains and water.  Vancouver is the way a city should be.  Dense and compacted with growth going up rather than out  The Twin Cities are built like people running away from each other, whereas Vancouver is built like people coming together (yes, I know I live in River Falls and work in MSP).

Can't recommend the Blue Horizon highly enough!  Stay here when you go to Vancouver.  I would be surprised if you say that it sucked if you get higher than the tenth floor with your room.",2013-11-23T23:42:51Z,137

766,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"We stayed for a couple nights here right at the end of December 2016.
We were told by the hotel in advance that there was construction taking place during our stay, and we were willing to overlook that fact. I'm thankful to say that we only heard them working for about an hour during an afternoon during the week and nothing during the weekend, so no construction noise impeded our stay. 

The rooms are nice. They seem to be mostly be corner suites which means they have their own balcony, but also that the room was nice and bright. At the same time, the blackout curtains did the trick to allow us to sleep in until a reasonable hour. 
The view from our 16th floor balcony was overlooking Robson street, but also provided a really nice view towards the water and mountains. 

My only complaint during our stay would be the ""Aquatic Centre"" which although had an adequate sauna and half decent hot tub, the pool was tiny and often filled with kids.

But in the end, compared to what other places were charging nearby, I'm happy with what we paid and got in return. The room was everything we needed it to be and was walking distance from Coal Harbour, Gastown, various Vancouver Transit stops, and of course the Robson shopping areas.

768,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"We started our BC--2010 vacation by spending two nights at the Blue Horizon.  Located on Robson Street, we were in the middle of dining and shopping central.   We heard that the traffic can be bad on Robson at night, so we got a room on the 28th floor overlooking English Bay.  There was still plenty of motorcylcles to be heard, but that's something that be expected staying in the big city.  Having a balcony overlooking the city reminded me of the skyline in Honolulu.  The room was nice and the bedding/linens/pillows were awesome.  Slept like a bebe.    

Can't beat the view.  Being a high up as we were, it was easy to understand why the water pressure of our shower was lower than perhaps the lower floors.
The elevators are small and slow--not good if you are claustrophobic.  I thought that they added to the charm of the place.

Plan to pay for overnight parking (~$15 CDN/night)  if you have a car.  They have a garage that is open to the public, so don't leave your valuables in your vehicle. 

The staff was friendly and willing to answer questions.  Most importantly, great location.   The best thing about the Blue Horizon: being able to open my balcony to feel the breeze and the bed.",2010-06-13T02:23:16Z,137

770,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"Loved it! This hotel has been recently remodeled, but you can still tell it is an older building. The lobby is bright and open, but not terribly big. There were lots of people checking in/out when we went through each time. I think they were tours. Anyway, elevators aren't super fast and they are pretty small, so frequently we'd be full up and have to turn people away on other floors. The hallways are narrow and not terribly modern looking. When we first checked in, I was like, oh boy, what have we gotten ourselves into.... then we opened the door to our room and my son said ""holy crap, this place is NICE!!"" So it seems they kept the halls narrow in favor of keeping the rooms large and open.

Each room is a corner room, with lots of light and great views if you're on higher floors. The bathroom is pretty small with a low ceiling - I wish they had taken a bit of the space near the ""kitchenette"" (fridge and counter and coffeemaker) and added a little space to the bathroom, but oh well.

Rooms were quiet and private, and truly had space to move around. Huge closet, robes, a safe, all the things you expect from a nice hotel. Staff at the front desk was courteous and quick.

Prices were very reasonable, and I would definitely recommend and stay here again.",2013-07-18T23:32:17Z,137

772,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"I booked through booking dot com and got the room for 143 a night excluding tax.  We were arriving early so I requested an early check-in at 12 noon.  When we got there at noon, our room was ready and they upgraded us to the 28th floor.  Happy dance!  The location is great, lots of shopping on Robson and surrounding areas.  

The rooms are so roomy (5*) but the bathroom is small (3*) and dated compared to the room.  I think someone else reviewed the hotel as 5 star rooms with 3 star amenities.  That's a pretty accurate description.  Beds are big and comfy with down pillows and comforters (5*).  The Keurig coffee maker is a nice touch but the coffee that I made from it tasted off (3*).  I think the machine was new so it had that weird chemically taste.  It wasn't a big deal though since I could get coffee at any number of nearby places.  I also bought Japanese ice coffees from Konbiniya across the street.  

They don't supply individual toiletries like shampoos and conditioners for ""green"" reasons but they do offer it if you really want it.  I didn't mind that either since I bring my own anyway.  They do have a liquid soap dispenser in the shower that you can use for shampoo or shower gel (3*).  They provide bath robes for use (5*) but no slippers (3*).  They do have a pool, sauna, and exercise equipment but everything is minimal and in one small area (3*).  The exercise equipment is 1 stationary bike, 1 elliptical, and 1 stepper.  

I read other reviews of it being noisy but I didn't hear anything but the kids above us stomping around every once in a while.  The views were spectacular (5*).  I'm not sure exactly what Matthew's title at the hotel is like is he a bellman or like a concierge but he's a very helpful young man in the blue polo shirt.  He's a little over eager but sweet.  We missed him when he wasn't around : )",2014-05-11T11:32:44Z,137

I love love love the views of the city while looking out of this corner room.  The two walls with windows opens up the room.  The floor space is not compromised by this room quality.  I thought that the restroom & closet areas were of normal size.
I did not have a problem finding any parking spaces during my stay, although they may look limited.  There might be a problem for huge vans and trucks fitting into the spaces. The spots were not too far from the hotel lobby, so lugging my luggage up down all around from the car to my room was not an issue.
The location is ideal with many shops and dining options a short walk away.  I would say that the area was safe enough to stroll along the streets during the evening.

777,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"We stayed here for a long weekend trip up to Vancouver. It was the first time to Canada for my husband and I - and we poured over different travel tips and reviews of hotels and where to stay before we decided to book at this hotel. For us, the biggest plus was the location of where the hotel was - right on Robson Street - and it was nearby to all the different things/attractions what we wanted to check out. We took a red eye out to YVR and when we got into Canada, it was quite early in the morning. Front desk was very friendly and knowledgeable - and more importantly, they hooked it up as there was a room available for us to check in to early in the morning. My husband really appreciated it as he didn't sleep much on the plane - and we were really tired as we had got on the plane right after finishing work for the day. We took a long power nap and began our trip well rested. Also, throughout the trip, the front desk employees were knowledgeable and quite helpful in helping us plan out our days and which activities to go for.

The room itself was a nice size, with a TV, desk, chair, balcony and queen size bed. The bathroom was newly renovated - so it was done up real nice and there were organic amenities for you to use. The only reason why I took off a star, was due to the fact that we were at an end corner room near the stairs and ice machine - and unfortunately any time someone was walking to the stair well or getting ice, we could hear everything right int our room. Minor inconvenience as I'm usually a heavy sleeper, but my husband's a light sleeper and he would wake up each time. The hotel has a restaurant in the lobby - we didn't check it out, but it seemed pretty busy whenever we walked by. There's also a gym and pool rec area in the hotel too which was a nice amenity to see.

Overall, we would definitely stay here again when we visit Vancouver. Was in great walking distance to many places - and there's restaurants, bakeries and a supermarket across the street so it was very convenient.",2017-05-12T07:47:54Z,137

The views are great.  Convenient parking.  The staff are always professional and friendly.  The rooms are clean.  The hot tub and pool are decent.  Rooms and facilities are a little out-dated, but it's not that bad at all.

To me, the bed isn't the most comfortable, but it's definitely not the worst.  One time when we stayed, we were in a room right next to the housekeeping's storage closet.  They were opening and closing the door constantly, making a lot of noise.   

One morning, I went to buy a coffee from the cafe downstairs and he only had small to-go cups for $4.  I thought this was weird.  After that, I just went to Blendz on the corner.  I think they're just trying to do too much in this 'cafe/bar/restaurant/diner'.  It gets confusing.

Then questioning me and told me they need to go through all the emails to see if I actually book the correct date.  They also told me there is no room left so they can not do anything about it.  I had to be very firm about my booking and refused to go somewhere else to find a room.

First of all, great central location to downtown Vancouver. Sure you can find better hotels and probably pay way more to stay there, but for the price and quality of this hotel, it was just what  my friend and I needed. The front staff was very friendly and we were immediately greeted at check in. We got a room on the 14th floor with two queen beds. Not too bad of a view but we didn't come for the views. The room was clean, well organized and the bed was comfortable! Definitely got a good night's sleep after eating, drinking, and walking all day. 

The price for overnight parking was $17 in their covered garage. Even though they had reports of break-ins, it's extremely important to lock up your valuables or cover them up. They have staff members that walk the garages on rotation, so I felt secured that my car would be in good hands all weekend. 

We didn't take advantage of their food and beverage services, but I heard good things about them.

Overall we had a positive experience,  we enjoyed our stay and even extended it for another day. Won't even check other hotels for our next trip to Vancouver.",2014-10-09T02:40:06Z,137
784,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"I have to admit. This place has been a treat since I got here. Now as a traveler from New York City I'm always paranoid about Bed Bugs but from what I've seen this hotel is very clean & has not shown a since sign of them. 

Once I was comfortable being here my only regret was the fact I didn't get a bigger room with a guest to share it with. The hotel is close enough to English Bay Beach to get a tan with a view. The buses are located all around the hotel so access to the popular areas of Vancouver is easier than I ever expected. 

The best part to me was the staff. They go out of their way to make your stay pleasant. This one girl named Jordan was very friendly and sweet whenever I needed something. She was kind enough to help me order some Dominos when I had a craving for it. 

If your planning to save a few bucks and get a tour of the city I would recommend this place. Next time I come to Vancouver I may stay here again but with a bigger room.",2014-07-30T00:21:50Z,137

We were there in July so Air-conditioning was key to our picking this hotel but the balcony and room were so amazing I highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to explore Vancouver.

788,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"This boutique hotel delivers on value, with a terrific location, great views and clean, comfortable rooms for a good price. Surprising quiet despite being on a busy stretch of Robson, this hotel is so close to so many eateries and bars you never have to venture far to fill your stomach or quench your thirst. If you need groceries, Whole Foods is only a few blocks west and the cute Japanese grocery is across the street. Fresh bread in the morning? No problems. Go to Cobb's breads so close by. Shopping? Head East and only 10 minutes away you will find many high end and reasonable retail shops. Because of the numerous eateries, we didn't use their outlets but I noticed the prices were quite reasonable. We were worried after reading Tripadvisor reviews that the bathrooms were small. Our anxieties were baseless. Coming from New York, I can say the bathrooms are a normal size, though there are only showers. The brand of amenity, OrganiQ, was wonderful enough to persuade me out of my ""haul light"" policy to take some of the lotion and body wash with me. WIFI was free. The beds were comfortable, and better after the second upgrade. We were upgraded to a corner room upon check in and upgraded again after an incident with a strange odor permeating our room  and the hallway one night.(security checked in and came to speak to us and the situation was handled).There is a small pool and the hot tub here is actually more powerful and hotter than the one the Westin Bayshore. Unlike some reviews that complained of bad service, we had courteous, knowledgeable service from Kartier during our stay. He was also quite patient during the entire horrible smell incident(which was no fault of his and was resolved in a few hours), even when I was threatening to call the fire department! We both were quite happy with our stay and we would both definitely stay here again.",2016-05-07T03:35:55Z,137

790,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"A perfectly adequate hotel for our first trip to Vancouver.

Great location, friendly staff and immaculate rooms.

As many others have said, most rooms have great views of the city and despite its central location, the rooms are well-insulated from the loud hustle and bustle of the surrounding urbanity.

The gym and pool area feels a little cramped and the restaurant could be better but overall a great place to stay, especially for the reasonable prices they charge.",2015-02-22T00:08:04Z,137
791,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"The hotel was nice as expected.  We booked through a third party so we only got a 5th floor room, which was fine.  The workout center had one elliptical and the pool was too short to swim laps but the hot tub was hot and the steam room didn't disappoint.  The location was good for tourists with easy walking to plenty of destinations.  The people were nice enough and the price met expectations.",2019-10-23T22:59:25Z,137
792,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"I was visiting the great country of Canadia from Seattle for a one night excursion. The location was fantastic being that it was right smack in the middle of the city.

Positives:
The rooms were surprisingly spacious with a big screen tv, a desk, a balcony (with an explosion of bird poop that made me not step outside), mediocre beds, nice long closet full length mirrors, soft robes : ) 

Negatives:
Ah here we go... Check in was at 3pm. I arrived with my friend at 3:30 after a grueling day of hiking, ziplining and the normal tourist activities wanting to take a nap and freshen up before dinner (because who like's going to a nice dinner smelling of sweat and Canadian dirt! I don't). The concierge said in a frantic manner that they were really busy and that the room wouldn't be ready for another 30 minutes. After a half hour jaunt around the surroundings of the hotel, we were fully ready for some rest and they still weren't ready! They were making excuses that they were completely booked the night before... maybe have more staff for a busy weekend? They told us to come AGAIN in 30 minutes...

GUESS WHAT! We got a key and was able to go to the room!... GUESS WHAT! The maid had just got to the room  for cleaning by the time we got up to the 19th floor.GUESS WHAT! We had to leave again and come back in half an hour! We were only using this hotel for one night and they were finally ready 2 and a half hours after their check in time!! 

I've stayed at Motel 6 and I've stayed at Pebble Beach. i completely understand you get what you pay for. But this kind of service was ridiculous and it wasn't the cheapest hotel around the block.",2011-08-26T08:45:38Z,137
793,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"This is a great hotel. It's not a luxury hotel or anything but it's by far better than chain hotels. If you're trying to figure out what hotel to stay in, here are some pros and cons about Blue Horizon:

PROS: 
1. fast check in
2. garage parking
3. fast elevators
4. fast wi-fi (impressively fast!)
5. cleanliness
6. good water pressure
7. all rooms are corner rooms
8. very private 
9. located right on Robson 
10. free internet
11. every room has a balcony
12. shuttle to Capillano is right in front of hotel

CONS: 
1. no security in parking garage and warnings of break-ins 
2. no room service
3. shampoo/body wash dispensary is not good for hair (bring your own!)
4. 11am checkout 

For the price, location and cleanliness, my husband and I were very pleased. We will definitely consider this hotel in the future!",2013-01-02T21:18:36Z,137
794,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,We booked the room over 6 months in advance for a special weekend away. We made a simple request to be in the highest floor possible the same day that we booked the room. The type of room that we booked was available between the 4th and 14th floor on a 31 floor hotel. When we checked in the lady at the front desk told us that she saw the note on the reservation about being on a high floor. She then told us we would be on the 4th floor. When we asked about being higher she stared at her computer screen for about 10 minutes and told us that was all they had. All we could see from our room was the top floor of the parking lot attached to the hotel. It was completely pointless staying at this hotel as we wanted a high room to have a view of the city as we do not spend much time in the city. They could not fulfill a simple request that was submitted over 6 MONTHS in advance. Next time I will take the advice my friends have given me and book an airbnb instead.,2019-10-20T22:37:11Z,137
795,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"I'm definitely a fan of the Blue Horizon. My husband and I stay here each time we come to Vancouver. On our last visit we were considering several pricier hotels but ended up coming back here because of the great location and fair prices.

The rooms are very clean and have super comfortable beds and pillows. The views seem to be great from just about anywhere, but I would recommend asking to stay on the highest floor possible. The only downside to this is probably the wait for the elevator. I swear we waited almost 10 minutes for the elevator one day. A couple did come, but there was not enough room for us to fit. I recommend not trying to catch it during checkout time.

Obviously, the location super convenient. You can walk to many places like Stanley Park and Gastown. Also, if you're looking for some upscale shopping this is your spot. Parking is cheap at $15/day but the lot isn't secure and it's open to the public. We paid $110/night for our room.

Bottom line: nice hotel, good prices, good location, cheap parking.",2012-06-04T20:27:20Z,137
796,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"3.5 star for being in the middle of Robson St. Where you can spend the day shopping and eating.

Be careful **** added $200 Security deposit fee****  on top of your bill 
but will be not be charged when you check out.  

The bed was a king size bed, very spacious.  The bathroom eh, eh, eh... not so great TINY!!!  Bring your travel size shampoo / conditioner.  All they have is bath gel like the one you see in the gym, which lathers from head to toe.",2011-09-19T03:08:02Z,137

2). Terrible service, the stereotypical forgetting-drink-order/didn't come around often enough eventually made us leave. We would have easily spent $100 more if she'd come back more.

3). Overpriced. A double caesar (pre-made mix) was $11.00. For Sunday brunch in Vancouver, as a consumer you can do much much better.",2011-08-18T20:13:37Z,137

It had to be one of the second most beautiful view I have ever seen in my life right behind the top of the eiffel tower. It was simply amazing and when you catch the sun set, it's perfect for a photo. The room was clean and I just loved the balcony.

The semi panoramic windows behind one of the beds which is extended to the other wall where the deck is is pretty sweet. 

We got a room at the end of the hallway, so you could hear the door to the stairs open and shut. It was a tad bit annoying. The bathroom was also super tiny.",2014-10-14T20:36:54Z,137
801,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"Such a great stay. I had a junior studio on the 32nd floor. Really roomy with a small balcony with unobstructed views of the bay. The bathrooms are small. When the door is open in the bathroom it basically takes up all the space. That's fine however.

AREA
Great area. I got by boba across the street, other food places in the area. I was here for the Lululemon half-marathon and there's a Lululemon across the street (maybe a block away)! 

FRONT DESK
Front desk can be overwhelmed sometimes during check-in and check-out, so just be ready for that. Elevators do get crowded especially when everyone is coming back or going out. I did have to wait a few minutes sometimes. Front desk is polite, fast, and helpful.

NO ROOM SERVICE, solution below
Breakfast/brunch at the restaurant that is connected was really delicious actually! No room service, so I went downstairs and ordered my food. I told them I'm staying at the hotel, so they gave me salt/pepper, ketchup, forks, etc. 

Will stay again next time for sure!",2013-08-20T01:35:57Z,137
802,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"Yep.  Five stars.  

Vancouver is pretty expensive.  I had trouble finding a room for under $200 per night so I was skeptical when I ran across the Blue Horizon Hotel.  ""How can they offer a room for $179 when they rest are charging $210 or more?""  I was mystified.  I was even more mystified when I read the reviews online.  People seemed to like the place.

So I booked the room.

When we arrived in Vancouver we were fresh off an Alaskan adventure full of hiking and kayaking and glacier viewing, so we were pretty beat up. We got to the hotel at 9:30 am under the assumption that our room wouldn't be ready and we'd have to store our luggage and drag our unshowered and unrefreshed butts around Vancouver.  We only had one day there no time to waste!

Not only was our room ready, but we were upgraded to a ""superior room"" which was humongous. King sized bed, balcony, clean and awesome shower.  Our one day in Vancouver was made so much better just because our room was ready for early check in.

The front desk staff was amazingly friendly.  In fact everyone in Vancouver was really friendly.  

I recommend the Blue Horizon a million times over!",2010-09-09T16:02:28Z,137
803,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"Spacious rooms, reasonable rates, breathtaking views, and a great location make the Blue Horizon Hotel an ideal choice when visiting Vancouver. Because of the hotel's shape, any room basically above floor 10 will get fantastic views. The restaurant in the hotel is great, but if you'd rather head out, there are numerous pubs and restaurants within minutes. I will definitely stay at Blue Horizon again when I revisit Vancouver!",2008-08-13T03:16:38Z,137
804,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"2 nights there cost approx a little over $300 with fees/tax/parking included. We got a king room but upgraded to a double queen but larger room.  Strange but it was a spacious room and beautiful view so whatever. 

Location is great in the heart of Robson street. Filled with shops and restaurants around all within walking distance.  

Steam coffee machine in the room and extremely plush soft terry robes as well.  

Helpful staff. 

Coffee shop/restaurant/bar on the first floor with TV.  Wifi included and pool. 

Highly recommended.",2014-04-30T21:47:40Z,137
805,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"I'm definitely a fan. We stayed here a few summers ago and were quite pleased. Our room was extremely spacious and had an extraordinary city view. In fact, although it was an anniversary and we were in walking distance to just about everything you could think of, we opted instead to swim in the pool and lounge in the hot tub, then ordered in some Chinese and kicked back in the hotel. I believe we paid $120 in the summer for a superior room too, which is an INSANE rate considering the location.

All in all, a clean hotel room in a great neighborhood, perfect for both those looking to hit the town AND for those in need of a quiet or romantic night in.

I would definitely stay at the Blue Horizon again.",2008-09-01T05:47:46Z,137
806,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"Overall, I think Blue Horizon is going for an upscale feel but falls a little short in some areas.  But for the price and location I would say Blue Horizon is a good deal.  I was able to book the day before through hotels.com and got a decent rate for a standard corner room.  

The hotel is located in a prime location downtown and lots of things are in walking distance.  Although I didn't partake most of the tourist sightseeing buses stop at the hotel.   A nice bonus was being able to keep our vehicle in the lot until 3pm (you do pay $15 plus taxes for parking), even though check out time is 11am.  

The room itself was decent in size.  The bed was incredible and I slept amazing.   I liked most of the decor, but it seems like the hotel has had a recentish remodel.  For instance, the bathroom had a really sleek modern vanity and faucet but the tub was I don't match 1983 rose colored.   Each room has a balcony, but we were on the third floor and overlooked the parking lot.  There is free internet but no WIFI and the ethernet cord stretched just enough to reach the end of the bed.  

There was a fridge, electric kettle, and coffee but no microwave and I wish there were more tea options than English Breakfast (most places that I have been to that have tea also have a mint variety or something decaf).    We didn't have a chance to use the pool or exercise equipment but they are there.  

The staff was super friendly and I would possibly stay again if I wanted a good bargain and had a room on a much higher floor.",2011-09-06T19:17:55Z,137
807,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"Terrible service, mediocre food. 
Alas our favourite Vancouver breakfast joint, Forage, was jam packed, so we wandered down to Abode. No real expectations for this place, but the appallingly bad service is notable.  
We were seated right way and sat for twenty minutes waiting for some to acknowledge us. Finally our waitress showed up, reeking of stale cigarettes and no apologies. I had to grilled her to get the breakfast special as the hostess bolted before telling us. 
I had the two egg bacon thing. Potatoes were ok, a bit greasy, the bacon greasy and limp, the soft boiled eggs were medium hard. The sourdough bread was buttered both sides with some sort of margarine stuff. 
The earl grey tea was excellent. 
Won't be returning and would recommend people go somewhere else for breakfast; this place is not worthy if your custom.",2014-05-25T23:32:02Z,137

809,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"I was recently reminded of this hotel 'cause I saw a recent front page review by another Yelper about it. In celebration of the Yelp 30 day challenge I figured that this was better late than never. This review is based on a stay that occurred about 6 years ago, however, judging from the most recent reviews...nothing has changed. 

I booked a staycation for my then finance and I. The lobby and the outside look nice, however, the rooms were not worth the price. I paid 5 star price for the location and what I thought would be nice rooms but instead got standard rooms that screamed 3 star room rather than 5. 

The service at the front desk was neither here nor there, very impersonal. Check out that day was a pain in the ass. The restaurant downstairs was pathetic in menu and service, most of which was pre-made.  

Thankfully we spent most of the day shopping in and around downtown, specially Robson.",2012-10-26T19:19:57Z,137

2.  Nice balcony with sliding glass door that opened!
3.  Great large windows with views in two directions!
4.  Helpful front desk staff.
5.  Central location near shopping, restaurants and a few blocks from Sky Train stop on Burrard.
6.  Comfortable beds and pillows.
7.  Very reasonable price.
Cons:
1.  Bathrooms are dated.  We had a broken light fixture which took 2 days to repair.  Carpet dated -- I prefer hard surface/wood floors.  BUT -- great shower water pressure and hot water!!
2.  Very slow and small elevators -- we were on the 24th floor and last night only one of three elevators was working, and we had to wait for three trips as hotel had filled up.
3.  Parking was tight when hotel was full.
4.  Maid services for our room was always late afternoon and several days we were back in our room relaxing...so skipped getting our room cleaned.

We had a corner room on a high floor and it is probably one of the best views I've ever had from a house/hotel/apartment or anything. Really spectacular. The location was amazing, right on Robson st. downtown. There is a free shuttle to the Suspension Bridge park right from the hotel. The skytrain is only a few blocks away and can get you to the airport. The staff was friendly and helpful. For a hotel downtown, the prices were all similar but I'm glad we went with this. For $160 US, it was on the higher end of my budget, but for one night and that view, I was happy with it. 
I don't think you can find a better price and location downtown if that's where you're looking.

There is actually, no information on how to solve the parking problem, until you get to the lobby. If you ask something, the answer is going to be no satisfactory or incomplete, sometimes they would over the phone""come the front desk and I will show you"" then a crappy answer... The noise on the hallway you would feel it like they were inside the room. Almost forgot, they make emphasis on the fact that is a non-smoking place, and there were people on rooms smoking....

824,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"This hotel is in a fabulous location, and our room was spotlessly clean. The bathroom fixtures - tiles, sink, shower, toilet - seemed brand new, and we loved the sleek, European design throughout. I'm fairly certain that each room at the Blue Horizon has its own balcony, and the views from every direction are breathtaking, especially at sunrise and sunset. Due to the hotel's design and the emphasis on exterior views, the elevator shaft is the central backbone of the building, so waiting outside the elevator feels a little cramped. To me at least, this was a very small price to pay for a room that is light, airy, and relatively inexpensive. Before booking, I checked all the nearby Air BnB's and realized that once the BnB cleaning fees and taxes were added, it was easier and at least the same price to stay here. I would definitely book at the Blue Horizon again.",2016-07-03T00:44:54Z,137
825,Blue Horizon Hotel,3.8,"HORRIFIC. Made our reservation in Feb '14 via booking.com, with a plan to drive up from Seattle to meet friends from the Midwest running the Sea Wheeze marathon in August.  Traffic on the drive up was horrible, so I texted my friend at 5pm (already at the hotel in their room) and asked her to go the desk to tell them we wouldn't be there to check in by 6. She did and confirmed everything was set with our res. 

Arrived at 6:45 after an exhausting 5 hour drive. The boy at the desk took my id and cc and immediately became evasive and said he would be right back. Wouldn't tell me what the problem was. Several minutes later, he returned with the ""manager"" Andrea. She introduced herself, and then proceeded to tell us our reservation was canceled because our credit card was 'invalid' (note, it is NOT invalid.) We explained our friend had confirmed our res at the desk less than 2 hours earlier (and the clerk she talked to was standing right there). No matter. Andrea repeated again and again ""We reserve the right to cancel reservations."" Never an apology, never a hint of remorse. We were dumbfounded. There was nothing she could (or should I say, WOULD) do. Closest affordable hotel room we could find was 5+ miles out of the city. So we had to turn around and drive back to Seattle. Of course we first asked Andrea the ""manager"" if she could comp us a glass of wine in the bar. She said no. Then we asked if we could leave our car for an hour to grab a bite to eat before leaving. She said yes, if we paid for it.  

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. We are well-traveled, have stayed in countless hotels of all types around the world, and have never ever EVER experienced such deplorable customer service. You couldn't pay me to set foot in this hotel ever again. And to add insult to injury, Andrea called back two hours later, as we were in line to cross the border into the US, to tell us she was able to make a room available to us. No thanks.

Incidentally, I spoke with booking.com this morning and they confirmed our reservation was completely in order, no invalid anything, and Blue Horizon violated their policy by canceling our reservation, which was secured by a credit card. 

Do yourself a favor and stay away.",2014-08-23T18:19:29Z,137

The bathroom was VERY small and I'm not tall or large by any means, the front desk people where clueless, asked them some questions on the area they had no idea. They didn't have recommendations on food, they couldn't tell me instructions, and seemed very unorganized. Next time I will be staying somewhere else.",2016-03-25T00:46:25Z,137

Your right in the heart of Robson with lots to do. My room was clean and spacious.  If I had to say anything negative is the bathroom was really small and they require a 200 deposit on top of the room rate. I'm on a budget and could have used that money to spend.

831,Empress Hotel,3.7,"The Empress Pub is a quiet respite that seems like another world compared to the corner of the DTES that it's located on. They have a decent quality back bar with cheap specials on beer, spirits, and doubles. There's 5 TVs, a jukebox and a busy pool table. The crowd is mostly over 50, but also mostly friendly and ready to share a story or two.",2019-12-03T09:37:52Z,6
832,Empress Hotel,3.7,"This is the poorest, toughest postal code in Canada.  The people on the streets are down-and-out.  The neighborhood is notorious.  This is an SRO hotel.  The age of the building is obvious like the rings in a tree stump.  A reasonable person would describe this bar as lower than a dive.

With a warm heart and a quirk for adventure, we enjoy the sense of community (don't sit at the bar stools unless you ask), the humility, the human characters and the low prices.  The staff is gracious and the atmosphere is humble.  These are good hardy souls and the more I think about it, the better the room looks.  I see that it is unchanged in decades.  Through the back door and across the alley, I see the police station.  I see people watching hockey.  We talk to people that don't live in a neighborhood like ours or dress like we do but, we all have the same interest in TV sports, pretty girls, and stiff drinks.

Pour me another and keep the change.",2011-01-19T21:49:26Z,6

I've been here a few times with the BF and some friends. The drinks are strong and the price is right.. No one bothers you except to give you a compliment (drunkenly so, but still funny and heartfelt!!)

There are regulars here that have their seats, so beware.. but they'll be nice about it. They have karaoke on Saturdays I think, as well!

The other nice thing, is that it's right behind the police station. The owner has told us that because of that, a lot of the judges, cops, etc come here to have a drink. So bad things don't really happen here..",2010-10-27T21:50:55Z,6
834,Empress Hotel,3.7,"Dive bar alert! 

The lovely Gina and I came here after a Yelp party for some drinks. We were dressed to the nines and cozied up at the bar. Apparently the stools at the bar 'belong' to regulars, even if they are empty, but the staff and regulars insisted we sit there. We felt pretty special! The patrons were friendly and really chill. And the drinks? Cheap! We had amaretto & cokes, but the funny thing was, they were super stiff because they came in child-sized glasses! It turns out the normal sized glasses always got stolen, so they had to resort to a more undesirable size. Well, it was quite the novelty and we loved it!

This place is right on East Hastings and inside an SRO building, so you can imagine that the decor is um... minimal. The bones of the building are beautiful though. This is no place to take the family, but a fun cheap stop for drinks if you're in the hood!",2010-10-25T23:06:05Z,6
835,Empress Hotel,3.7,"If you have to read up on a review of the Empress Hotel, then you obviously have never heard of this place - because anybody that has, will never have to read a review.

This place is the best place to commit suicide, if that's your thing.

The heroin here is not the best in the world, but I'm sure that it will help you do the trick of becoming close to death.

The hookers here are well past the ugly looking stage, in fact UGLY looking hookers are still good looking in comparison to these hookers.

The watered down beer doesn't even taste as good as putrid stagnant water and the decor is that of World War 1 and 2.

If you love the stench of foulness lingering in the air, then this is the place for you.

The check in process was super easy and the front desk people were great. Actually, all the staff we encountered were great. 

They have on-site parking for an additional fee but youight as well spring for it because it's pretty convenient and affordable. 

The room was clean and well stocked. I was a little worried the bed was going to be uncomfortable because it was bouncy but I ended up getting a great night's sleep. The view from the room and the balcony were beautiful. 

Our stay was perfect and we would stay here again.",2022-03-27T21:32:31Z,34
838,Holiday Inn Vancouver-Centre,3.6,"I am surprised why I have never written a review here. I am just surprised! I have been to Holiday Inn before for Seminars and other events. As well, the CPA Chapter association loves renting the venue here for several reasons:
1) price is very reasonable and is cheaper than other venues like Sutton, SFU downtown and etc.
2) food tends to be better. More than enough food
3) free wifi provided
4) services available upon request. No nickel and dime customer like the other venues.

They have a parking garage but its not free. There are free 2hrs parking nearby but that is a hit and miss. As well, the location is close to downtown but not in downtown. If you are a tourist and you want a reasonable priced hotel than Holiday Inn might be a pretty good option else I say stay downtown. 

Overall its not bad here.",2018-06-04T01:39:53Z,34
839,Holiday Inn Vancouver-Centre,3.6,"I was here for an event which was held in one of the function rooms on the Lobby floor. The room was ok, and the sound system was working well.

What surprised me was the ladies' washroom. It was tiny with only two cubicles. It was not sufficient, creating long line and a wait when there are events going on, and the place was full.

Maybe there are more washrooms further away. I did not ask and I did not see any visible signs indicating that.

Parking is available within the hotel which is convenient. It is a flat rate after 5 pm ($7+). I will say to keep things out of sight in your car as I saw a dodgy person trying to open the car door parked next to mine, and then moving away when it did not open. I was not sure if the person was waiting for the owner (who may be a friend) or was really just waiting for an opportunity. There were also a few people in the car park when that happened. As with many other car parks, there are signs indicating all cars are parked at your own risk. 

Or you can park along the street. Free 2 hours parking can be found a few streets away.",2019-08-12T17:26:04Z,34
840,Holiday Inn Vancouver-Centre,3.6,"The hotel is beautiful the clerks at check in were lovely.  The bed was so comfortable best sleep I've had in a long time.  The room was clean and well appointed.  The balcony gave us an awesome view of the harbour and all the boats and barges.
I was a little surprised we had to pay $23 for parking, we have never paid for parking before.  
We had an appointment at Vancouver General Hospital, a 3 minute walk, they let us keep our car there until later in the day, but then we hadn't even been there 24 hours.
We were hungry and tired from the long drive and so much construction so we chose to eat in the bistro/lounge.  Very nice server, beautiful room.  As it's on the ocean we hoped for fresh fish in our fish and chips but it was frozen, shock!  I had the salad, it was very big full of avacado, nuts, cucumber and tomatoes and beautiful spring greens, well at least the top was beautiful.  I poured the dressing from the very small container mixed it a bit and started eating, I needed more dressing so she charged me 50 cents for another, oh well.  I mixed it all up make sure it was all dressed and then it begin I picked out a large handful of slimy yucky lettuce out of it, I picked what I could out as I was hungry and told the server and she said nothing, I expected some or all taken from my bill but no.  The Caesar's were very good as was the cheesecake, I needed something besides half a salad.  $78.00 was way to much for a bowl of guck, frozen fish and chips dessert and 2 drinks.  We went for a short walk after and found so many restaurants next hospital visit we will not be eating there again not for dinner.  The free breakfast was very good eggs, sausage, bacon, porridge, fresh fruit toast muffins, and croissants.",2022-07-24T00:06:12Z,34
841,Holiday Inn Vancouver-Centre,3.6,"I think this hotel is rated three stars on a major booking  site.  I think for a three star hotel it doesn't get much better than this, although I am sure there are nicer hotels in the city. The price was attractive and the location is pretty good. 

It is in a rather odd area next a large hospital, but it is only two blocks to the train. I decided I really didn't want to be on a train, but most of the things I did want to look at were 3km away, in various directions except, of course,  the mattress store. On the corner near the train station there is a shopping area with a Winners/ Homesense, a HUGE Canadian Tire, a Home Depot, and a giant (if slightly disappointing) Whole Foods. 

The rooms were pretty nice for the price. Flatscreen TV, refrigerator, coffee maker.  All the standard toiletries you would get in a four star hotel. The bed was comfortable too. The room wasn't very large, but it was clean and the decor was modern. I did not have a particularly nice view, but some of the the rooms do, and I booked at the  last minute. 

The staff was  extremely professional and helpful. They answered all my dumb questions and gave out maps with directions to places I wanted to see. I really appreciated that because if there is a problem I have with staying at a ""reasonably priced"" hotel,  it is that sometimes they are just really not into answering my  dumb questions. It has been my experience that when they don't want to talk to you, they aren't likely be that helpful anyway. Also, when I called, they were honest about the time they could have the room ready. I  really appreciate their honesty over telling me what I want to hear feeling disappointed. (I hate the restaurant thing where they tell you half and hour, but  an hour later you are  still starving and dizzy from drinking cocktails.) I would rate the desk staff here five stars and I would  consider staying here again. 

****After another stay I upped the rating to 5 stars. I like the location and I got a room a side not overlooking Broadway, which was somewhat loud due to the hospital. The staff was really pleasant. Overall, for the price, I think is it an excellent value.",2016-12-28T03:12:48Z,34
842,Holiday Inn Vancouver-Centre,3.6,"Good price, clean rooms, I would definitely come back.

Parking/Location: About $20 a day for covered parking, but there's no security.  Located right on Broadway around the nicer area with tons of popular restaurants.

Ambiance: It's not the Fairmont, it's Holiday Inn but definitely one of the nicer ones I've been to.  Clean, smallish lobby area with a few comfy seats.  First level is lobby/restaurant, above that are the parking lot levels then conference rooms and bedrooms above that.  

Service: Front counter was very nice and accommodating.  I heard them deal with some more difficult guest with lots of patience.  Our car battery died and we asked for help and they recommended cabbies - just pay them $20.  It bugged me at first because I felt like if I were them I would have helped out, but they probably have procedures and policies about that.  Cleaning lady was very sweet and did a great job.

Food: $17 breakfast buffet with Chinese items: chow mien, congee, Chinese steamed buns, Chinese Siu mi (like in dim sum restaurants)
Western hot items: tater tots, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, small roasted potatoes, pancakes
Pastries: toast, scones, muffins
Cold items: Cottage cheese, yogurt
Coffee/tea
They also serve other meals but we didn't try any of it.

Bedroom: We were in a corner room with 2 queens - I think it's one of their bigger rooms.  Small sitting area with sofa bed and coffee table and long counter/desk area and another small comfy chair+mini coffee table.  Balcony was nice touch.  Very spacious.  Clean, tidy.  Bath & Body works shampoo, etc. and I really like the slippers they give you.  The only thing that bugged me was the shower drain was slow and it just got slower and slower (minus 1/2 star).  I had to stop the water several times to let the water drain.

Misc. They have 3 different types of monopoly, 2 of which require batteries that aren't there.  Pool there - didn't check it out though.  Very tiny ""business center"" which was basically 2 computers and printers and just enough room to turn around in it.  Elevators were a little wonky - you have to keep pressing it to make it go, otherwise it just sort of turns off (minus 1/2 star).

Recommendation: I really like this place - if I need a place to stay in the area - I'd definitely come back.",2018-01-28T06:14:10Z,34

We made a reservation last night to stay at this property so we could see a family member at Vancouver General Hospital. This was a non refundable reservation, we had no reason to think we would need to cancel.
Woke up this morning to head out, come to find out or family member was moved back to her home town over night unexpectedly.
I called the hotel to see if maybe we could have a credit for another date. We don't live near by so it would be a financial burden to drive to Vancouver without a reason.
Miles was wonderful, handled our situation with care and understanding.

844,Holiday Inn Vancouver-Centre,3.6,"Stayed here during a Christmas time visit to Vancouver. I selected this hotel primarily because of it's close proximity/walking distance to the Enchant Christmas Light Maze. We stayed there for 2 nights. 

I do like the location of the hotel - it's close enough to downtown, yet at a great affordable price. It's a few blocks away from a sky train station (Olympic Village) and there's lots of restaurants around (there's a dim sum restaurant right outside of the hotel's main entrance) and lots of stores like whole foods, a michael's and a drug store. It's also not that far a drive to Metropolis at Metrotown mall. The hotel has self parking (which was i think 20 CAD a day). I did like that it had a touch screen in the elevator (didn't realize it until someone actually touched their floor lol). 

Great staff - check in was a breeze, and the front desk staff gave us room options: either a room with a great view, could be kinda noisy, or a room behind the elevators and is very private. We ended up going for the private room instead that was on the top floor (16th floor). 

Our room had a queen sized bed. I loved that the pillow cases had it sewn on indicating if the pillow was firm or soft. Room decor was ok - nothing too fancy but it wasn't bad either. There was a flat screen TV, a fridge, kruig machine, and lots of places to plug in and charge our electronics. Bathroom was very clean. 

There is a restaurant located in the hotel as well. I did do the breakfast buffet one morning. Good selection of food and i liked how they had a couple of dim sum options and congee as options. We also ate there for dinner and overall, i thought the food was alright.

The best part of this location is that it's only a few blocks away from the SkyTrain station, which makes it way more convenient to go Downtown or to the airport. Lots of bars, restaurants and convenience stores nearby. 

Parking is twenty dollars in their private lot. They offer a free continental breakfast but I did not partake in it. I do like that they offer free wi-fi.",2016-11-16T22:54:52Z,34

The last time I checked in, the lady at the front desk gave me a welcome bag of potato chips and a bottled water (maybe that was part of the Priority Club perks).  They have recently renovated (last year), so the lobby looks nicer.

They have free wifi, but the internet can be pretty slow.  There's no microwave or fridge in the room.  There are plenty of sushi and Thai restaurants nearby.  Tim Hortons and Shoppers are a couple of blocks away.

There's a restaurant inside the hotel that I've never tried.  I did stop by next door at the Golden Great Wall Szechuan Restaurant and their beef noodle soup was pretty tasty.",2013-03-20T01:48:14Z,34

850,Holiday Inn Vancouver-Centre,3.6,"2.5 Stars in reality 

We picked this Holiday Inn because it isn't very expensive and is conveniently located.  The room was a decent size and clean.

PROS: 
-- Recycling bin in the room. Go Canada! 
-- Easy to get downtown; we did it by car and bus. 
-- Nice view of downtown skyline and mountains in background. Well, we had a room with a view, but everyone can see it from the parking garage. 
-- Sink in the bathroom, not separate and facing the bed. Read my hotel list and you'll see how much that means to me! An Extra Star just for that! 

CONS: 
-- Our room was by the elevator and we could hear it beeping all the time. I guess it's the usual cheap hotel thin walls. 
-- Slightly scratchy sheets. 
-- No fridge or microwave in the room. In this day and age?  Come on! 
-- 75 cents to make a local call. Which of course I didn't know till we got the bill. 
-- The adjacent parking ramp is not actually owned by the hotel (see Mandy H's review for an elaboration of the confusion). I think it is a public garage also used by the hotel. Having to use the garage added to the cost of the trip but it was nice we didn't have to deal with trying to park on the street. Also, when you pull up to the hotel there's not really a good place to leave the car while you check in. 

The hotel is connected to a restaurant and lounge that we did not try. Broadway is a busy street and there are several restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and a drugstore within walking distance. There were free water bottles in the lobby one day. No issues with staff. Overall my experience with this Holiday Inn was OK. Not bad but I don't think I'd want to stay here again.",2009-12-24T03:52:55Z,34
851,Holiday Inn Vancouver-Centre,3.6,Stayed for a medical appt and hotel is so conveniently located super close to hospital and cancer clinic. Hotel was clean....everyone followed the COVID protocols (even the few guests I seen) and staff were amazingly friendly. They let me checkin early and checkout late to accommodate some last minute appts. Beds are a bit soft but still comfortable and it's nice to have complimentary bottled water in the room. I also really appreciated the hair products being of normal scent (a coconut lime) instead of sandlewood or musk 2-in-1 products many hotels are using these days. Will definitely recommend and be back!,2020-11-20T02:40:59Z,34
852,Holiday Inn Vancouver-Centre,3.6,"I showed up about an hour before check-in time and was prepared to wait in the lobby for awhile. I also considered going up the street for coffee or food or doing something else to kill time if need be. I had a question for the front desk though first and even though I was early they found a room that was ready for me so I was able to check-in right away. I was grateful for that especially since it was pouring rain out so I was happy to be able to unpack and dry off right away. I saw a lady from housekeeping in the hallways and she gave me a friendly smile and head nod saying hello as I passed by. The room was nice and clean. There was a no little kitchenette with microwave or utensils or anything like that. There was a keurig with tea and coffee and a tiny fridge. I made a seagull friend who was oddly fascinated by me and stuck around for quite some time. (Even after I closed the blinds so I could change in peace. haha) I called him Sammy. There's alot of great food places nearby and some other convenient stops are within walking distance. I did a tiny bit of shopping and went back to my room. At one point, Sammy and I were watching tv and the signal went out. I called the front desk and they had someone already on their way up as the signal came back itself after a couple of minutes. Any time I talked to the people working here they were all extremely nice and helpful. I slept well as the bed was comfy and it was quiet all night. I didn't try the restaurant. I was given the impression there would be a balcony before my stay and there wasn't but the view was nice. If there was a balcony, more of a kitchenette, or even breakfast thrown in to make up for lack thereof that would have been awesome. I still had a nice stay though and I appreciated the quiet, cleanliness, and great service.",2016-11-09T03:52:25Z,34
853,Holiday Inn Vancouver-Centre,3.6,"Meh. Not overly impressed with this place. The rooms were clean and the staff were all very friendly. So I'll give it that. But one of the elevators wasn't functioning properly when we were there. Then when you go to use the stairs they don't lead to the lobby. You have to go to the parking garage, then the the elevator from there to get to the lobby. This seems very strange to me. Not to mention annoying after climbing up and down the stairs one night just to find this out. I told the people at the front desk that there should be a sign on the stairwell door indicating this. Hopefully they take my advice to save future patrons the trouble. Overall it was a good experience and I would stay there again. Checkout is 12 pm, which is really nice.",2017-02-23T07:03:39Z,34

It's also very close to the Subway, which is very convenient. It's about a 1.5 mile walk to Granville Island too, which is nice if you follow the parks along the river.

The staff there almost go OUT OF THEIR way to make the guest feel stupid and uncomfortable. 

We parked in a pay lot under the hotel that said, ""Holiday Inn additional guest parking"" -- when we told the guy at the front desk, he says, ""oh, yeah, hope you don't get a ticket. he, he.  that's not our lot."" And we're like, 'umm, it says 'holiday inn additional guest parking... how is this NOT your lot?"" and he replies, ""yeah, that's just the name of the parking company that owns the lot, as well as the name of the hotel. it's just a coincidence."" 

(mind you, the logo was the same on both, also -- WTF????)

Hunny and i ordered room service breakfast (NOT included -- it was 27 dollars for toast, juice and fruit! wow!) and my toast came soaked in butter when i requested it be 'dry'. not a hard request when it's one of 3 things included in the breakfast. When i called down to room service to get it replaced, the ""gentleman"" on the phone replies, ""well, you didn't ask for it dry, so, ugghh, i guess, well, this is the only time I'll do this.""  I WAS SHOCKED. isn't customer service your JOB?! 

At check out, we brought up the fact that the dollar's value had really slipped, and how terrible the US economy is right now... and the guy at the front desk actually had the nerve to say to us, 'what, so you think the dollar should be worth MORE than the Canadian one or something?' like ACTUALLY picked a fight with us!!! holy hell!

The ""queen beds"" are glorified twins -- hunny and i were so crowded sharing a bed it was RIDICULOUS. it is NOT downtown -- a ten dollar cab ride to the middle of the city (Granville street and Robson) and it's still priced similarly to some of the finer places in the city.

I HATE giving one star to anything -- truly, check my other reviews, but i canNOT in my right mind give this hotel anything higher, after the experience we had. I left feeling dirty and mistreated. A hotel stay should be an EXPERIENCE, and this was just that, only an extremely NEGATIVE one. 

My advice -- spend maybe ten bucks more a night to be downtown, and get the amenities like inclusive breakfast and parking, actual glass cups in the bathroom (not Styrofoam), walking distance to hot spots (Yaletown!), and quality customer service. This place is the PITS.

(oh, and it smells of manure. sorry, but it's true.)",2008-08-12T16:57:27Z,34
857,Holiday Inn Vancouver-Centre,3.6,"Upon check-in, I found that the rate they were charging me $10 Canadian over what I was quoted during reservation.   The manager reversed it but it did not make a good impression on me.

There was no business or club lounge - which I usually use  in the morning as Priority Club Platinum member in other hotels for coffee in the morning.   As result, I had to rely on their restaurant for breakfast and paid for it... not very happy about that.    The restaurant opens at 6:30 am and kinda late for the east coast person...  

They were doing construction there at the time of my stay so the only elevator was very slow.   

This is not your luxury hotel and don't expect a lot of extras - but it is okay with fairly clean room.  Nothing to write home about.",2011-05-27T02:25:43Z,34
858,Holiday Inn Vancouver-Centre,3.6,Wow. I won't stay there again. First of all...the price! One night was way too expensive for the quality of room I got. Second was the wifi it kept cutting out and when it worked was slow I ended up just using my data. Third the noise from the rooms on either side was loud plus the hallway noise kept me up all night.  If you are looking for a place to stay in Vancouver I'd suggest someplace else.,2016-08-14T17:24:51Z,34
859,Holiday Inn Vancouver-Centre,3.6,Fantastic hotel if you are near the hospital. My check in was fast and efficent. The front desk clerk was so helpful. The lobby was spacious and you get free Globe and Mail papers to read. I love this. I can't stand when a hotel is so cheap they won't give you a paper. The room was very clean. The room service was a bit slow. It took about 45 min to get a piece of apple pie with whipped cream. I really liked the breakfast buffet. They had some Dim Sum items on the menu. Delicious. Lots of fresh fruit. Overall I had a fantastic experience here. Would highly recommed them.,2017-03-17T18:34:26Z,34

864,Holiday Inn Vancouver-Centre,3.6,"I stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights prior to a cruise. Although the hotel is not right near the cruise terminal, the hotel does have a cruise package with a shuttle bus, or you can very easily get a taxi or take public transportation. Our room was in good and clean condition. We were right near the elevator but never heard it. Internet was a little slow for our iPad. There are many restaurants in the neighborhood. I felt safe walking around even at night. The staff at the front desk were very nice. They broke our bills for change, they made a reservation for us for a city tour, and they gave us directions to our other touristy spots. I was a little annoyed when I asked for a recommendation for a restaurant for dinner, and the staff member rambled off a list of every restaurant in the neighborhood, and I did not know if they were actually good or not. In-room breakfast was expensive for a the cheap ingredients.",2014-08-12T00:13:01Z,34
865,Holiday Inn Vancouver-Centre,3.6,"We had a totally nice experience here. While the outside isn't very modern or overly appealing, it was in the process of being power washed and there were plenty of signs indicating when it was happening. It honestly fit right into the neighborhood around it anyway. Just make sure you don't put money in the parking garage box in the elevator lobby. You'll pay with your bill. Our room had been renovated so we did have a refrigerator and everything was neat as a pin. Bed was comfy and no hotel noise for us on the 16th floor. There's a restaurant attached in the lobby and we ate breakfast at the buffet. No problems there. The staff were very friendly and made recommendations for us as well as tips on parking in the city, etc. I would stay here again without any hesitation but if you're looking for uptown curb appeal you may want to look elsewhere.",2012-06-13T22:17:29Z,34

870,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"I stayed here for 6 days for my NYE Holiday and I have to say it was a really pleasant experience here.  I can't think of anything here that went wrong or needed to be better, everything just turned out really well during my stay.  

So I needed to find a hotel in Vancouver after Christmas and into New Years, because I was fed up with Seattle (spent Christmas there) and was eager to get to Vancouver for the first time ever because I've heard such wonderful things about the city.  I surfed Tripadvisor and everyone loved the Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier.  It got rave reviews, and they were doing a deal, so I did some research on it.  

One picture at this hotel caught my eye - - the swimming pool.  It looked just like a regular lap pool that I'm used to at the YMCA.  It is very rare to see a regular large lap pool at the hotels in the States. I know sometimes they ""stretch"" the pics out to make it look bigger and better, but this looked like a 25 meter pool - - so I just called them up to find out.  She confirmed - yes - ""it's Olympic sized"" she said.  Wow!  Turns out it's 25 meters with 5 lanes.  Well you had me at Olympic.  I'm sold.  No reason to search around for other hotel deals, let's stay at the north pier for the rest of the year.  

So the drive out there is about 35-40 min from the Canadian / US Border.  I was a little leery as I got close to the hotel driving by all the Port and Industrial areas, concerned about the surroundings and offerings.  But once you get there it's like a whole new town.  There's a night life, restaurants, some shops, hotels, bars, you name it.  Looked really good so I checked in.  

Parking was $29 a night, and it's garaged and gated below the hotel.  You can go in and out as many times as you want and I never had issues finding a spot.  Very happy that the parking situation - it was seamless. 

The room was perfect.  Had everything I needed.  A nice tub with shower, good water pressure, updated bathroom and decor, a small fridge and a microwave, TV cable works well along w/ the wifi.  Had plenty of room, the bed was firm and everything was clean.  No complaints at all.  

I swam at least 4 out of the 6 days during my stay and it was great.  They also have an awesome steam room that works well, a sauna, hot tub, plenty of workout space for yoga, stationary biking, and weightroom.  I was really impressed.   Pool water was a consistent 82 degrees.  The only downside was there's no lifeguard on duty and that means the patrons can do what they want - so there's definitely a lack of pool etiquette.   I swim my laps but people will not ask to share the lane with you, they just jump in, along with the kids, you have to deal with it - - but it's not everyday.  The views of the harbor were nice too.  

An 8 min drive east of the hotel is Strong Grocery Store - which was perfect for me.  Of course there's an A&W nearby, in fact I think their offices were a few blocks away.  I was really pleased with the surroundings.  It won't fill your entire week, you'll have to drive to experience other areas of Vancouver, but it certainly met all of my needs.  I was really pleased with my entire stay here and will definitely come back.  Customer service was always responsive and attentive, helped me with all of my questions and a big help in my extending my stay for 3 extra days.",2024-01-11T16:58:01Z,71
871,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"This was our first trip to Canada when we stayed here. The hotel is very nice and clean, the rooms have a lot of space, the hotel lended us umbrellas, and was overall, a good hotel. 

I had one problem though: The bathroom. If you look at the photo, there is a literal window looking into the bathroom. You could easily watch whoever is in there. The design is just so stupid. At least there are blinds, but they are on the outside, so people (even though they may be your friend or family) can still watch while your on the toilet or showering.",2023-10-11T03:17:33Z,71
872,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"We had an amazing stay at Pinnacle that started with an upgrade to a harbor view room. The front desk staff is efficient and kind. The room was just the right size for lounging and resting between activities. This is actually the first hotel we've stayed at in a long time where we just parked the car and didn't see it again until we left. There is so much to do in this area, yet (at least in the winter/off season) it's a chill place to walk around. Not much going on after hours, yet it doesn't feel unsafe to be out at night. 

The hotel is adjacent to condos and another hotel. Across the way you'll find an area that is an ice rink in the winter and a water fountain park in the summer. There's a promenade that's great for a long stroll. You're close to the Market at the Quay and tons of eateries. And on the north side, you'll find more restaurants, salons, spas, and shops, including a pretty nice Salvation Army for thrifting. 

We took full advantage of the Olympic-sized pool, wet and dry saunas, and hot tub. There's also a well kept, good-sized gym. Note that the pool is divided into lanes for swimming so it's not necessarily a good place to splash around with kids. Also, for some reason the showers are super hot--I couldn't find one that was cool or warm. 

We capped each night with drinks and dinner at The Lobby where personable, attentive Josh took care of us. The angus burger was killer. The truffle fries, addicting. But the drinks... the drinks were much better than what I thought I'd find there: I especially enjoyed the Empress Lavender Lemonade (Empress 1908 gin, lavender, wildflower honey, lemonade) and To Build A Fire (Beefeater gin, ginger beer, rosemary-demerara syrup, lime juice). Happy Hour (Mon-Thur, 2pm+ | Fri-Sun, 2-6pm & 9pm+) is a little sparse, but at least there is some savings if you decide to go during those hours. 

Parking was easy and felt secure, although it's not gated. Every place we tried (be it Larry's Market's kombucha slushees or Anatoli Souvlaki's delectable lunch) was a pleasure. We got tons of steps in because the area is so walkable, there's a lot to explore. The pillows were fluffy, the bed comfortable (if a little on the soft side), and everything was clean and well kept. We can't wait to come back in better weather, although it's delightful to stay during the off season when everything is relatively quiet.",2023-01-10T18:28:16Z,71

877,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"You can't tell me there's a better location for a hotel in North Vancouver, and if you did I'll call you a liar. Because there just couldn't be. It's right there at the water, just a stone's throw from everything. A short walk to great restaurants, a brand new museum, and of course the Lonsdale Quay Market. 

You are right there in the thick of things, and that's pretty great. Sure, right now there's a little construction going on outside and they're making even more attractions, but it seems there's a real renaissance of sorts, and the Pinnacle is at the heart of it.

The hotel itself is pretty tidy, top to bottom. The front desk was really nice, there's a small bar/restaurant there on the bottom, and the room I was in was all I needed--comfy bed, and a view of the big hill going up into the city. My guess is the Vancouver skyline rooms are great, too.

One of the quirks is that you have to enter from the river-facing side, and not from the top corner of Lonsdale and Esplanade. The address is on Victory Ship Way, and my driver's GPS (side note: C'mon Vancouver, get with the program and get Lyft already!) could not locate the address as written. It's a cute little stone paver street but it's not obvious from the main drag up above.

I spent a couple of nights, sat at the restaurant, and feel like I had a good 101 tour of the place. I didn't get into any of the amenities (there's a pool?) and so I can't speak about them. But everything else was fine, I slept well, I showered, and I even watched HGTV because I'm told that's what you do when you're in Canada.",2017-12-11T06:49:37Z,71

879,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"Wonderful hotel in a great location.

Visited this hotel in early August 2019 and loved it.  The location was perfect for us as it was close to public transportation and the Lonsdale Quay market.

The hotel itself was modern, clean, and in good condition.  The room was spacious and bright.  Upon arrival, the room was clean but smelled musty like it was wiped down with an old towel.  After  a good wipe down (by me) and a few hours with the AC up high, the most of smell went away. 

The amenities were nice.  The gym was outstanding compared to other hotels in the area I checked.  It was a full gym complete with a large exercise room that they hold classes in.  The view from the modern gym of the water was beautiful.  Equipment inside the gym included: 5 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, a few stationary bikes (in the exercise room), full dumbbell set, cable machines, exercise balls, and a few weight machines.  There was also a big indoor pool large enough to do laps. It was great not having to travel anywhere to get a gym workout in.  A decent restaurant and a small shop for snacks, toiletries, and a few other general items, were also on the premises.  We did have one big bummer.  The bikes the hotel was supposed to have available for use to tool around the area were not available the week of our visit.  My daughter was really looking forward to using the bikes.  Wish they would've had some type of notification of their unavailability prior to our arrival.  

Customer service varied from good to outstanding depending on who was helping us.  

Overall, an outstanding hotel with a few glitches but I would book again.  Rounding up from a 4.5,  I gave it a 5 for our stay.",2019-09-04T21:53:13Z,71

The location is amazing as it's right on the water with lots of eateries (including Lonsdale Quay Market) in walking distance. The staff is very friendly and a giant bowl of apples greets you when you check-in. There's a fun restaurant/bar in the lobby, along with a small assortment of grab and go sundries as well.

The rooms were nice and big and I loved the giant walk-in closet. But the best part of this hotel? The GIGANTIC swimming pool with jacuzzi which my kids adored! It kept them busy while I worked an event and this was the most amazing help because it was time they didn't spend watching TV. I unfortunately didn't have the chance to workout in the gym, but the jacuzzi was wonderful!

If you have the chance to stay here I highly recommend it as we ended up finding a great rate and you can take the ferry to see the attractions across the water if you'd like to make a fun day trip out of it.",2018-01-17T07:47:02Z,71
881,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"For $132 per night USD, my work colleagues and I each had a king room at Pinnacle by the Pier. The best part beyond the price was the location - a few steps across the street from a party venue where we were helping set up and host.

I wasn't expecting much but was happy when I was the lobby, the amenities and overall accommodations.

Rooms were spacious by big city standards, with a large bed, well lit vanity and sexy shower/bath combo within. Free Wi-Fi worked so I didn't have to put my phone on roam. Plus CO Bigelow bath products. 

There's a pool but I didn't bring my suit or have much time for recreational activities. 

The lobby bar was fine for morning hot chocolate or a pre dinner drink. So many good restaurants in North Vancouver to try, I wouldn't commit to anything at the hotel for sustenance unless you are exhausted and can't walk a few blocks.

My friends and I checked in a little after midnight. We literally came straight from the airport and we were exhausted from flying all day but Trevor and Americo were so genuinely welcoming right from the start. Trevor even went out of his way to suggest places to eat, printed out restaurant menus and provided pamphlets of activities and sights to see in Vancouver. The hotel itself is very clean and modern which is just the way I like it. :)

We locked ourselves out of our room safe on the second night and we called the front desk to see if they could help and Trevor came to the rescue within a matter of minutes. On my last night, I mentioned to Trevor how I enjoyed hiking and later that evening he slipped a note under our door with a list of hiking trails for us to check out if we ever returned to Vancouver.  Wow, I was thoroughly impressed! Two thumbs up experience in my book!

Sidenotes: 
1) We stayed at the top floor ocean view but there is ongoing construction outside the hotel at the moment so you will see a big yellow crane front and center. The view didn't really bother us though since we spent most of our days out sightseeing anyway.
2) There is available garage parking at the hotel for about $25 CAD a day.

884,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"I was checking my credit statement after staying at the hotel. I noticed a $50 charge and called to see what the charge was. It turns out I was charged for two bottles of wine form the mini fridge. Turns out they were filled with water. Now I had been violently ill during my stay and was in no place to be thinking about, let alone drinking two bottles of wine. It is clear that no one properly checked the mini bar from the last customer who stayed in that room. I am now wondering how much they are actually cleaning as the items in my mini bar were clearly handled before my arrival. I am glad that I did not handle anything in the mini fridge. I was not offered anything for the inconvenience. 

The hotel should be checking in with the customer before they start charging random incidentals to the room. I will never stay in this hotel ever again.

Pros:
- beautiful boutique style modern rooms
- bed is comfy with lots of pillow and no comforter, which is good since they're gross
- free wifi
- fridge with plenty of space and keurig 
- pool, hot tub and workout space with huge yoga room
-hotel lobby and rooms are very clean
-close to lots of shopping and dining
-reasonably priced (on Expedia at least)

Cons:
- mountainside is really a nice way of saying that it's a view of the street. Pay extra for the water view
- parking is $18

Misc:
- I am laughing like crazy at the shower in our room (see pic). It has a sheet of glass for one wall. The blinds to give the person showering some privacy are in the bedroom. I am detecting the opportunity for lots of peeping and or scaring your roommate 
- parking is on the waterside of the hotel. It is garage parking

I liked being close to, but not right in, the busy part of town.

The decor was modern, and the king bed was sooo comfortable. Probably the best sleep I've ever had away from my own bed.

The amenities were nice -- free red delicious (and boy were they delicious!) apples in the lobby, as well as free wifi, coffee, pool, hot tub...and I read that there are free bikes to borrow, but we didn't take advantage of that.

This hotel demonstrates how to nail customer service and experience as my husband and I enjoyed our stay and could not stop raving about the staff.

Everyone was friendly, informative, helpful, honest and overall they seemed like they enjoyed their job! Smiles everywhere :) That really sets the atmosphere.

How about the rooms? Very clean and neat. Good sized room and we had a lovely view of the harbour. Bathrooms are roomy and modern! 

The restaurant at the hotel is delicious and they have specials each night and even LIVE music a couple nights a week it seems. 

We had a GREAT time in Vancouver and Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier is one of the main reasons why! We were well rested. 

Getting to DOWNTOWN VANCOUVER couldn't be easier as the walk to the Sea Bus is literally only a couple blocks away. There are lots of shops and cafes near by the Sea bus stop as well.

Then, you can jump on to the Sea Bus which is clean and only takes 15 minutes across the harbour and you land right in downtown Vancouver.

If you want a water view, get an odd number room up a few floors. 

Check out the pool and hot tub - w outdoor seating on a deck overlooking the water. 

Bar was nice - good selection of single malt and a very friendly barkeep who is, of course, an actor!

Good free wifi. 

Friendly helpful staff. We would stay here again for sure!",2015-09-11T18:51:13Z,71
890,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"This is a very nice and cozy hotel with great service. It's great value all around. Rooms are great and clean and people who clean the rooms do a great job. Restaurant's food is great but service could be better, having said that the people who work there are very nice.",2019-12-09T04:07:05Z,71
891,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"Parking is trash here, is more expensive to park here overnight than downtown! That being said it was somewhat climate controlled which is nice and was super convenient as you could park literally next to the door up to the hotel. Nice gym area and small steam room and sauna to boot! Lobby is pretty minimal but generally had an excellent stay here.",2019-12-19T18:59:09Z,71
892,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"Don't give 5 stars much but The Pinnacle is really awesome!
Down by the quayside, close to the Seabus, lots of touristy shops and a brewery (Local brew Bridge IPA!!!) within a few hundred meters, North Van ~ the quiet Vancouver side, parks, and epic mountain biking mecca!
The coffee is The Lobby Restaurant (on site) is really good!  Great food too!  Breakfast ~ salmon omelette  and excellent potatoes! 
Folks were friendly and warm, too!  Our room was very comfortable, housekeeping kept the Starbucks K cups stocked, and room service dinner was reasonable ~$50 CAD.

Bank was nearby to convert American $ to CAD, too!  $1 = 1.23 CAD !!!  Woohoo!",2016-07-29T22:04:47Z,71
893,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,Breakfast/brunch at the Pinnacle Hotel in North Van.   I can see me coming here more often.  The Crab Cake Benny was just the right size for me.  Add a cup of tea and it hit the spot for a Saturday's brunch with family.  I'd like to try more dishes on my next outing there.  I'll just have to make the time.  Especially when you can relax and enjoy conversation and you don't feel like you're going to get out out.  The place is comfortable and relaxing and perfect for get togethers.,2018-11-25T07:05:08Z,71
894,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"Had a Saturday night dinner with my husband. The food was good. Right near the pier that has a night market on Saturday nights. 
Service was great. Nice selection on the wine list. Very comfortable atmosphere. 
I would definitely recommend visiting this spot for dinner.",2017-07-16T19:13:17Z,71
895,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"If you are planning to stay here, ask for the harbor side view because the street side can be quite noisy with trucks and cars zooming by all night long. Street side also gets you a full view of the condo across the street. Yes, they can see you walking around your room naked right from the comfort of their living room couch. Then again, you get to see them walking around naked too.

The hotel seems fairly new with a lot of modern touches to it's decor. Clean and comfortable is my impression and that's how I like it. There's not much of space to each of these room, but if it's just for two people, you should be fine. One thing to note is the glass viewing window between the shower and the bedroom area with the blind/shade control in the bedroom side. I guess you can view the other person taking a shower while you're in bed. Kinky.

The cleaning maids are pretty quick at cleaning your room. We left for breakfast one day, and came back within an hour, and our room was made. Fresh towels and soap daily.

Here's my complain:

- Our TV reception sucked. All the channels were fuzzy and nothing seemed clear.

- Water pressure sucked. It's constantly low. At least the hot water was consistent. 

- Paid daily parking $11/night in underground garage.",2011-10-12T22:00:04Z,71
896,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"Our room with the harbor view was beautiful! Unfortunately we had the double beds which felt a bit small. Nice balcony. Beautiful bathrooms with curtain that opens up to bedroom. Very romantic (too bad daughter was with us on this trip). But very detailed amenities. 

Swimming pool was excellent!! Lap pools, jacuzzi and both steam room and sauna. We loved it! Good sized gym.

It had underground garage parking with elevator linking to lobby. Didn't like having to walk past lobby when going in/out or grabbing something from car. Everybody looked a bit dressy-uppy so I feltl self-conscious walking in/out with my sweats...Overall nice fancy hotel and short distance from nice walk out to pier or nearby shops/restaurants.",2014-01-09T07:40:45Z,71
897,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,What a great hotel!  The location is walking distance to so many restaurants and activities.  The market is so close and has a great variety of shopping and food shops.  The rooms are large and very spacious!  We also got to use the pool and the hot tub was so relaxing after a busy day around Vancouver.  We rented a car from a nearby Avis that is also walking distance to the hotel.  We would definitely stay here again!,2019-06-15T02:49:18Z,71
898,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"This new hotel on the North Vancouver side couldn't be in a better location if you want to stay in the Lower Lonsdale District. Situated just 100 meters from the daily ferry terminal, you don't have to drive your car to get downtown. Also, the Lonsdale Quay Market is literally across the street so you can enjoy this little market for all its worth.

The hotel itself is very new and every room it nicely appointed. Free parking in the underground garage came with my Travelocity package for the duration of your stay and we easily found empty spots each time. Call the hotel to make sure you have this included or not. The staff are professional and very eager to make sure the new hotel keeps their reputation for being attentive. My wife and I didn't experience any lack of experience from the staff even though they are less than a year old (opened in 2010 for the Winter Olympics). 

We had a harbor view room which is worth the higher price for the nice view from the small balcony. A nice assortment of toiletries are provided. Wi-fi and high-speed LAN are readily available for free in your room and throughout the hotel.

The 3rd floor is dedicated as a health and wellness area with a full weight room, cardio equipment, yoga studio (run by an outside fitness company) and olympic size pool and jacuzzi. The shower rooms have lockers and are very nice.

The lobby restaurant and bar was very accommodating to my guests who came nightly for drinks. They have a very good breakfast, lunch and dinner menu that gets good reviews overall. Again, we had attentive service that was friendly and appropriately casual while remaining professional. We ate there twice and had drinks their twice.

The downsides: This is not a destination hotel unless you want to be in North Vancouver but perfect if you want to be in Lower Lonsdale. Their is construction going on across the way (as of August 2010 at least) so you will encounter noise if you're trying to have a relaxing morning/afternoon in your hotel room. There is no on-site massage/spa so you'll have to go elsewhere if that's what you're looking for. Getting to the lobby from the street is a little awkward since you have to enter on a side street via car that does not allow U-turns to get into the driveway. I either had to drive around the block or do an illegal u-turn. Their is no pedestrian entrance from the main street either. A little odd. We did have water leak in our closet and we were immediately moved to a new room. They gave us complimentary breakfast for our trouble. 

Pictures and reviews you'll find online on Travelocity, Expedia, etc. are accurate and you can call directly for more information. I find their website a little sparse for details but I'm sure that will improve as time goes on. Call for specials as they change weekly (I missed getting a free 3rd night since I booked before that promotion was online). I even emailed their sales director who promptly emailed me back and sent a nice note and gift in our room prior to arrival. They truly aim to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable.

I will stay there again when we return next summer. We had perfect weather and couldn't think of a nicer place to stay. For $189 a night I think this was a very good deal for such a new hotel that was near the water.",2010-09-02T03:48:54Z,71
899,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"Great place!   Excellent location, great rooms, pool, gym, nice lobby bar and reasonable price.   What more can you ask for.   We were on the top floor overlooking the Vancouver City side.   The gym was good size, the pool was probably the biggest I've seen at a hotel.

Only drawback was shipyard lights are bright all night (really bright) so you have to use the blackout blinds (sad for not being able to sleep and look out at City lights).",2016-04-06T00:17:34Z,71
900,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"Stayed here during Victoria Day weekend and it was an amazing experience for several reasons.

1) The view. Yeah it was the best part of staying here. It was gorgeous during day time and night time. And I love how every room has a balcony so that we can sit outside and enjoy the view. 

2) The room. The bed was soooo comfortable!!!!! I did NOT want to get up the next day. And the bathroom, was gorgeous. The glass window/wall kept my kids entertained.

3) Room service was DELICIOUS!!! We placed an order and before the order arrived, we realize we should get something else. Instead of bringing up our first order and do the other order later, they were able to bring both to us at the same time. I thought I will have to watch my husband eat before I get mines but they made it so we can eat at the same time. Amazinnnnng!

The Friday that we went, there was also a night market right in front of the hotel. There were lots of food trucks and local vendors. So if anyone is interested, definitely coordinate your trip/stay to when night market is happening. It was so fun and filling. 

My one complain is parking. Because of the night market that was happening, their parking was very limited. I think when there are things going on, they should close off a floor, just for the hotel guests.",2015-06-10T21:01:30Z,71
901,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"The rooms are nice and comfortable. The front desk staff is stiff and does not go out of their way to be helpful or friendly. There were several missed opportunities in our experience customer service wise. The pool and fitness center are really nice, but we found a swim team practicing in the pool when we went to use it.  I read some reviews about construction, and did find the building below are room under construction,  but the noise was actually not that disruptive in the morning. This hotel is not super convenient to the airport and the hotel does not arrange any shuttle services. I would not suggest the location for a quick stay if flying. There are a ton of fun restaurants within walking distance of the hotel though and the night view is really beautiful.",2018-07-13T16:05:37Z,71
902,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"Lots of perks at this hotel!  If we ever visit Vancouver again (and I hope we do) we will stay here.  The price is right (much cheaper than the hotels downtown) and it's a short walk to the sea bus station that for $3 takes you across the bay and to downtown Vancouver.  Super easy and convenient.  The rooms are very nice, new, and modern with lots of great amenities.  They have a nice gym and a huge indoor lap pool that overlooks the city skyline.  Also, on Friday nights in the summer they have a market where they sell local goods, have music, and have plenty of food trucks for dinner.  It was really fun! 

Props to Pinnacle!",2015-07-08T23:52:41Z,71
903,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,Great hotel. The bed was plush and comfortable.  I loved the setup of the room and deep bath tub. The fluffy towels and robes added to my after bath experience. Lovely water views. Excellent value for the money.,2017-03-26T05:11:07Z,71
904,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could. It wasn't perfect, but overall this stay was pretty great. It's a beautiful building located on a beautiful (albeit industrial) waterfront.

I chose this hotel for our 1-night Memorial Day stay mostly due to the fact that it has an indoor swimming pool (very important for my 8 year-old), but also for the great ratings, price, and just to try something new.

The drive over Lions Gate Bridge was beautiful and impressed my son, who isn't that easy to impress. The hotel is tucked away from the city (it's in North Vancouver), but I think that's part of its charm. I hear that it's very conveniently located to the Sea Bus that can take you straight into DT Vancouver, but we didn't ride it.

I do wish there were more food options that were close by (see my review of The Lobby), but that's the price you pay for not staying in Richmond or Vancouver, I suppose.

The room was beautiful, the bed was super comfortable, the bathroom setup was amazing (full glass wall looking into the bedroom). The showerhead sputtered quite a few times, so it was a little concerning, but nothing malfunctioned.

Parking was reasonable (although I would expect free parking since it's located outside of the metro area).

My only gripe is the hair dryer. I wanted to dry my son's hair after he showered, and someone (staff???) had wound the cord so tightly and looped the HUGE power plug into the cord so that it was impossible to undo, so I couldn't even plug it in, much less use it. Who does that?

Anyway - for the right price, would stay here again. A bit far, so we might stay in Richmond or downtown Vancouver next time, but this is a super nice getaway from the hustle and bustle. The pool deck and views are pretty amazing too.",2015-05-26T02:58:17Z,71
905,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"The location of the hotel is beautiful! My partner and I got a room facing the harbor and we got to see the Pier all lit up. The room was spacious - we got a king bed for our stay. Sheets were nice and the mattress was very comfortable. Usually I complain of a sore back in the morning due to the softness of the mattress, but this one was wonderful! The bathroom had a lot of light which was great - very clean. The range of snacks offered in the room and the coffee they provided (complementary) was awesome. They let us check out a bit later when we gave them enough notice. I would definitely stay here again.",2018-01-03T04:10:06Z,71
906,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"I stayed here with my twins, almost 13 years old.  I'm giving it three stars for a few reasons.  Basically, this is a construction zone, and from the looks of it, it will be for a very long time.  Even though it is a water view, it's hard not to notice the huge mud pit below, where they're constructing another building eventually.  And a ginormous crane is smack dab in the middle of your city view.
The second reason for the three stars is the pool.  While it is an Olympic-sized pool, what they don't tell you when you book is that they rent the pool out to swim teams and other locals.  You'll be lucky to venture down at 7 p.m. and get anything but one measly lane to swim in.  The other lanes have either lappers or a very loud, obnoxious swim coach yelling instructions for an hour.  The next hour is another group of swimmers.  By 8:30, they will clear the pool for only the hotel patrons, but that's a bit too late and we were tired.
On the plus side, the rooms were very clean, the beds were very comfy.  BUT (and this is a HUGE BUT) the room and the bathroom are separated by glass and wooden blinds.  While that may seem okay, the problem is that the blinds are on the outside of the bathroom.  Every time I was in the bathroom either showering or changing, I was nervous that one of my children would think it funny and draw the blinds or peek in.  Good thing that I have well-behaved children, because that didn't happen.  Who would even put this glass wall setup?  The only thing I can think of is so that people can view the water/city while taking a bath, but honestly, I think you'd be too far down in the tub to even be able to see anything.  I wouldn't stay here again for those reasons.  There are too many other Vancouver hotels to choose from.",2017-04-16T02:26:25Z,71
907,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"I had the privilege of staying here. I loved it so much I ended up staying for about 4 months while I was on business in Vancouver for an extended period of time. They made me and my yellow lab feel right at home and made every accommodation for us. The bell desk even got treats for my dog once I explained to them that the reason he sniffs behind their desk every day was because our doormen in Manhattan had treats at their desk. A gorgeous incredible view, fantastic pool and workout area, great food. Located close to a fabulous market and great restaurants. The ""scene"" is fabulous.",2019-09-22T01:55:58Z,71
908,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"Very noisy!  There is construction happening right outside my window...cranes, saws, jack hammers starting at 7am.  Not pleasant at all and the hotel does not disclose this on their website.  This is a huge project and will be going in for many months.
The beds are not very comfortable, quiet hard in fact.
And they staff is not very accommodating.  I could not check in at the regular checkin time so I asked for a map of the area to walk around.  They did not have one and no one had any suggestions for me.  Then the night before check out i asked for late check out.  They told me I would have to ask in the morning.  Really odd, and actually changes my plans for the day knowing when I can check out.
There is no reason to stay here verses downtown Vancouver.  I should have continued to stay there as there is a free shuttle to the sights on this side (no shuttle at this hotel).",2017-10-11T16:50:00Z,71
909,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"We stayed here for 3 nights and it was wonderful.  This was our first time visiting Vancouver and initially I wanted to stay in downtown Vancouver, but I am SOOOOO glad we stayed here (wife made the choice).  

The room we had was extremely nice and well appointed.  I guess Keurig coffee machines are the ""in"" thing as this one also had it (see my review with The Maxwell Hotel/Seattle).  It was facing the street, but our view was really nice still.  The bathroom is huge and very nice.  Their is a mini-bar and the normal bar food stuff..but no need..there's a marketplace and supermarket just down the street..(see below)

They have an AWESOME gym on the ""P""ool level.  They have a gorgeous 25M lap pool..think around 5-6 lanes.  My kids swim competitively on a swim team so it was really nice to keep them in shape.  They also have another room where they were doing Zumba and then a nice fitness room.  

This hotel is located in North Van(couver), but don't let that turn you away..at all!  The SeaBus operates every 15 minutes AND it is truly much mellower and SAFER place to stay..it is just 500 meters from the hotel.  Downtown Vancouver is like any major downtown an I wouldn't want to walk around after night, however, North Van is mostly residential so it's a lot more quiet BUT they have EVERYTHING you need.  Plenty of restaurants and marketplaces.  Nice place to take a stroll..extremely safe and quiet.

An important thing for us, when we travel, is that there is a supermarket (IGA) right down the street and plenty of quick meals (Lonsdale Quay Market is fantastic..and literally 500 meters from the hotel).  

Another plus is that the local bus station is right outside the SeaBus station (Lonsdale Quay) so you can take bus 236 to go to Grouse Mountain and Capilano Suspension Bridge..it was perfect!  It is a loop to both places and takes you back to this station..how perfect is that..no way to get lost.

If you are a first timer to Vancouver, skip the hustle and bustle (take the Seabus at the Waterfront Station) and stay in North Van at the Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier.  We look forward to staying here again next year!",2014-04-27T03:03:56Z,71

Kinda want to go there for dinner now to try out the other items on the menu.  They served a wonderful encrusted rack of lamb that was amazing!",2015-03-18T22:57:18Z,71

I felt it was better than many hotels that are actually downtown at much higher rates. Its conveniently located near the seabus terminal, which made the commute to downtown easy.  

Also  in the room were a microwave and a mostly empty refrigerator.  

The lamps could stand to be updated.  Bedside lamps didn't have USB ports which was inconvenient.

Overall we were pleased and would recommend this hotel.",2017-02-25T13:32:49Z,71
915,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"This hotel was very classy and sophisticated; there are times if you're wearing jeans and a T-shirt you feel very under dressed but it's because there are weddings and other special events held at the hotel.  Everything was so easy and convenient to get to - there was a pool, gym, workout classes, wifi, and room service offered to hotel guests.  If you don't want to pay $4 CAD for a bottle of water there is a Market and the Lonsdale Quay just a few blocks from the hotel. 

The view from the the hotel is amazing, you're able to see across the bay where Canada Place and the Vancouver Skyline sits.   Other views include Stanley park and Grouse mountain; it's amazing being able to see everything so close.  

One thing about the hotel is there is a mountain side (street side) or pier side.  The pier side has the wonderful view of bay and the skyline.  The mountain side is mostly the view of the other building in the area and possibly Grouse Mountain the back, but it's also very noisy if you leave the door open and occasionally in the middle of the night you can hear trucks drive by.",2012-05-29T16:55:59Z,71

Great views, we were upgraded slightly for free to a room that had the view of Vancouver and the water.

Stay here! You won't regret it!

There's some free parking right on Esplanade, but it's a long walk to the front lobby.  Nice sit-in lobby area on the right, but washrooms you'll have to sneak around to the back, even with the front desk on the right, after their in-house restaurant.

In a very safe area so tourists, not to worry.  Plenty of good restaurants all around.  this would be my first choice if you want a spiffy hotel, it's the best in North Vancouver IMHO.",2014-03-11T10:49:02Z,71

Very convenient to seabus (5 min walk to hotel) which crosses the harbour every ten minutes or so, and leaves passengers at the downtown waterfront station where both skytrain lines are immediately accessible, and where Gastown and lots of other interesting attractions can be found. Also on the hotel side to the north, it's a lovely area near lots of shops and restaurants surrounding the hotel.  Enjoyed the bike ride, compliments of the hotel's bike lending.  And enjoyed the fitness experience, compliments of the hotel's fitness room.  Lots of nice areas to walk along the waterfront.  Very helpful and friendly staff.  We had a fine breakfast too in the hotel restaurant, with really good marmalade.  Just all around lovely.  Nothing negative.",2018-08-10T00:39:49Z,71
921,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"If your looking for a place to stay in Vancouver that has easy access to the city, but don't want to be in the city proper then this is the place for you.

This was our first visit to Vancouver. We got in a few days before our cruise to enjoy what Vancouver has to offer. The location is excellent. We were only 2 short blocks from the Seabus which was our mode of transportation to the city proper.

Checking in was a breeze and they ladies at the front desk were very quick and helpful as our flight got in pretty late.  The lobby was nice and clean. They also had a restaurant there to grab a bite. They also have free WiFi!!!

The room was clean and spacious. Furnishings were nice and well maintained. We had a balcony room facing the water and even the balcony was clean. The bed was very comfortable. There is a nice size cooler in the room, so we ended up going to the market which was a short block to but water and some food.

Even though we didn't use the pool or the gym this visit, I did take a look at both as I wanted to see how the photos did compared to the actual location. The pool was pretty large and indoor. The gym was larger than what I have come accustomed to here in the U.S. even compared to some of the top brands here.

Can wait for our visit again! We will definitely be staying here!",2016-07-02T02:33:56Z,71

All through the stay they were very attentive to our needs. Even though it is middle of winter they were still more than happy to open their bike locker to allow us to borrow some bikes to go riding!

You can upgrade your room to overlook the water-side view. Food in the restaurant is very good. Never been disappointed. A five minute walk to the Lonsdale Quay, which is not what it use to be but is perfect to walk to for some fresh fruit etc. There is a movie theatre, grocery store, salons, and various yummy eateries all within a couple city blocks or a 5-10 minute walk.

The coffee and tea service was exquisite and the staff were friendly, professional and competent.  I tried to stay there later as the event left such a favorable impression on me, but they were SOLD OUT.  Plus they have taken an old shipyard and redeveloped it into a beautiful retail space adjoining out onto a pier with stunning views of downtown Vancouver.  living on the north shore it is the perfect destination for a week night, where you can grab a drink at Tap 'n' Barrel.  I would recommend the Pinnacle to anyone looking for hotel on the north shore.",2015-10-17T05:18:37Z,71

The customer service is the worst I've experienced in a while.

Friends of mine got married and there were a few people that were staying over at the hotel...(a few, I mean probably 3 or 4 couples at the most).

We were dropped off at the hotel at about 2am in the morning on a Saturday night and proceeded to say our goodbyes, etc.  (Please keep in mind that we were not that drunk and are most of us are in our 30's)...One of the front desk staff came over to tell us that he had gotten 2 complaints (in less than 10 minutes, really?) and that we needed to break up the party...

We were all so unimpressed with the place that I will NEVER stay there or recommend anyone else to.  I understand that if there was a crew of 30-50people and everyone was yelling & drunk it would have been a different story, but come on now, really?

930,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"My boyfriend took me here for a late birthday getaway-slash-Canucks preseason game. A little shopping for me, a little sports for him - that would've been fun in and of itself, but staying at the Pinnacle definitely tipped our little mini-vacation into the ""awesome"" category.

I've stayed at some nice hotels, some crap hotels, some quirky hotels... and this hotel qualified in my top three. Location was great - North Vancouver itself may not be the snazziest, but the Lonsdale area is lovely, and the SeaBus terminal is a 3-minute walk away (without dragging the hotel into a seedy touristy sort of feeling), making it a snap to run over to Vancouver proper (for the aforementioned shopping and sports). Our room was a 6th-floor ""mountain view"" (read: the nifty little area of Lonsdale and the condos/apartments across the street). The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, and though it did take them about an hour to bring up a toiletry item from the concierge, they apologized profusely when we called to remind them, and gave us two. :) Parking was $10/day, with come-and-go privileges, and for the convenience it was absolutely worth it. We didn't avail ourselves of the bar or restaurant (which I've heard & read are great), but will look forward to that next time.

Best of all, we got a great deal. :) WIN. Definitely recommend this place for a getaway - romantic or otherwise.",2011-10-04T06:25:39Z,71

933,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"My husband and I stayed at the Pinnacle a week ago, and I can admit that I am a fan. Here are the good stuff of the hotel. 

 

The Good Stuff:

1. Free WiFi in the hotel rooms, letting us surf our phones without having to pay LD surfing charges.

2. 2 free computers in the Business Center to use anytime. (Unsure about printing capabilities but I'm sure they would allow)

3. Room was beautiful, however a little scared when taking a shower if I was being looked at from the other side of the harbor. Eeek

4. Room textures were awesome and definitely took tons of photos with the room ambiance. Room even had a microwave which you don't see often, and we enjoyed popcorn while watching late night TV

5. The King size bed is extremely comfortable, but the pillows are a little too soft for my liking. 

6. Room was cleaned every day, and left in great shape. Though I have been places before where they will actually put your shoes back in the closet, or fold your clothes neatly for you. I may be being picky, though that is the reason that I tip them, so it would be nice to have something more than the bed done.

7. 100% non-smoking, which makes me feel very clean when I am in the room. I also like the fact that the balcony is non-smoking as it makes me feel I can walk barefoot and not worry about ashes on the ground.

8. Lobby bar is convenient to get to when you want to grab a bite and drink. I like the fact that there are different type of seating (table, bar, lounge chairs) to make it whatever style of sitting you prefer.

9. Hotel is in the best spot of N.Vancouver cause it is so close to transit. Easy to get to the city and a lot of different options for daily meals during your stay. 

10. Incredible views of downtown. If you are visiting when the fireworks are happening in August you will be able to see them from the harbor facing rooms

All in all, we enjoyed our 5 day stay at the Pinnacle and will for sure recommend it to others. I will definitely be back also when I plan to visit Vancouver, it really is the best place on earth!",2011-08-23T14:44:52Z,71
934,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"First let me give you three notes:
1) I travel a decent amount.  Typically once per month, and I stay in your typical Hyatts, Hiltons, and Marriotts when I do, for business.
2) My boyfriend and I drove from Washington to Vancouver, and were stopped at the border for him having a common Spanish Name.  He's from Boston, and is parents are from Puerto Rico, but we still had to undergo a 30 minute screening on the chance that he might have smuggled up through America from Mexico...  The Canadian border police let me (an average, 30 year old white girl) on through without a second look...  \Sigh for Canada.  By the time we got to the hotel it had been a 4 hour drive, and we were grumpy and tired and hungry.
3) It was my birthday weekend, where I would be migrating from 30 to the deadly 31, so I was a little more on edge than usual.

Now - On to our stay:

Checkin - Easy.  I had booked through Travelocity and it was a simple, card for incidentals and ID scenario.  We asked if Room Service was still running (We were starving!)... The answer was no, but he gave us a list of local places that delivered and let us know that even more info was in the folio in our room.

Ordering from outside places - Don't do like me and dial the area code like we have to do in Washington state.  You get charged long distance if you do... \Mefail.

Room - We were booked into Room 801, top floor overlooking the water.  It was gorgeous at night, and beautiful by day.  Yes, there is a crane.  I knew it was art before I got there, but I could see how others would mistake it as ""construction""...  That said, beyond that one bit of art that most travelers don't really get, the room was clean, comfortable, and well-maintained.

The main quirk is the shower window.  Essentially rather than having a wall between the room and the bathroom, there is giant glass pane (with blinds) giving you a full view access into the bathroom.   Because the blind control is OUTSIDE the bathroom, you really have to trust whomever you are staying with you respect your boundaries while showering.  I could see it being great for sexy time... (Honeymooners - stay here!) but it would be weird if you were staying on business with another member of your work, or with friends.  If the person controlling the blinds was the person in the shower, it would be no problem.

Amenities - We didn't use the gym, but since it was my birthday, the staff gave us complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries.  THEY WERE AMAZING and went a LONG way in amending the Canadian Border Police Nonsense.  They set the stage for a wonderful time.  Room Service Yam Fries are the bomb!  Also FREE WIFI!  Note: Parking is $10.  Not a big deal if you expect it.  Just know it. :)

938,Pinnacle Hotel at the Pier,4.2,"This is possibly the most courteous staff and great rooms that we have stayed at in years. We usually stay across the bay in Vancouver proper, (Marriott Pinnacle where we had a few issues with mold), but a 10 minute Sea Bus ride is all that it takes to really make the stay in BC quiet and slows down the hustle / bustle pace of the city. The room was very clean and housekeeping on the ball. The Lonsdale Quay Market (Mall) is a 2 minute walk away and Pier7 restaurant also just a short walk away. We have just planned our cruise for 2014 and are currently booking a room at the Pinnacle. The cruise pier is a short 5 minute walk from the Sea Bus ferry and shopping directly surrounding the pier. I highly recommend this hotel. If you purchase the Sea Bus pass, it lets you ride all the local transit and Sea Bus trips you want for the day (seniors that is $7.50 US). I recommend exchanging US dollars for Canadian dollars as many of the merchants in Vancouver will 'surcharge' for using US $.

Accessible to public transportation, restaurants, and grocery stores.

941,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"This is THE place to stay at if you are visiting Vancouver. The prices are reasonable and provides great value. The staff and service members are extremely professional, helpful, and quick. Always greeted with a smile and immediate assistance when required. 

The hotels itself felt new and in great condition. As you enter through the lobby, see if you can find a little treat inbetween the seating area between the restaurant and the check-in counters.

Parking is relatively effortless. A quick tip: parking in P1 is easier and probably safer since you have access to the elevators directly where you are parked. Just go in the garage, turn left to the end and take the ramp down.

The gym is small-ish, the pool has full changing areas and there is a hot tub on the far end. They are a bit of a walk from the elevators, almost a bit like a maze. Access on the 5th floor, you go to the end of the floor, go through multiple doors and down a flight of stairs to get to it. But hey, just getting more exercise in right?

Platinum+ members always receive complimentary breakfast and kids too. Also included are non-alcholic beverages throughout the day. Food can take a while to come out though if you go during morning rush hour. Either a bit under staffed or a small kitchen, but the food is always excellent.

Lastly, a quick shoutout to Pedro the front office manager, who was able to help us with an issue we had post-checkout easily and made us feel appreciated. We've stayed here a few times and have enjoyed it tremendously each time. We'll be sure to come back for our future visits as well.",2023-12-31T17:57:47Z,89
942,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"=== 1. VERDICT/VALUE 
Pretty solid choice of hotel: relatively new, good service, good accommodations - definitely worth considering if staying in Richmond/Vancouver!

=== 2. ROOM 
Modern decor and potentially good views await you:
 - Carpet was being replaced in December 2023.
 - Modern LED light fixtures.
 - Potentially views of planes taking off and landing (if facing north).
 - Plenty of desk space and power outlets (but no USB outlets) at desk and bedside.
 - Relatively quick responding TV with full selection of HD channels (with at least three channels for those traveling with kids).
 - Spacious shower and separate bathub.

However:
 - Closet can be a little small for those with 2 or more in their traveling party.
 - I wish there was a place to put your suitcase - or a stand-up rack for one.

=== 3. SERVICE 
Front desk staff were professional and quick; the requested towels came up in a reasonable amount of time.

=== 4. ENVIRONMENT 
Overall, it's a relatively new hotel built within the last 10 years with two reasonably-fast elevators.  I did not see the gym, but Marriott patrons will not the lack of any sort of lounge or place to meet except for two small to medium seating areas in the lobby.  A treat seems to be offered every morning/evening, from shortbread cookies to Tim Hortons Timbits.  Parking is a little odd - it's underground, though one must enter/exit via the ground-level gate area unless you're parked one level down on P1, as there is no door between the parking and the hotel.",2023-12-23T02:12:00Z,89
943,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"A group of us stayed here two weeks ago for work and we really enjoyed our stay for the most part. I can't say this place is great or bad, because it was just okay! I think this is not your typical Westin for sure, because they are quite small for a Westin and things are not very conveniently located within the hotel. 

First off, it is a trek to go to the pool and gym, it is in a separate building.

Second, regular Westin you would get bathrobe an slippers, but I found out that here they don't give slippers and for bathrobe, you have to request it. Even though, some rooms already have bathrobes. We only found out because half of our group had bathrobes already in their rooms and half of us didn't!

They also have parking but parking spaces are limited and they share with the residences next door. 

There is also no lounging area except the lobby. There is no recreational activity rooms/space, or just hotel living room to sit. Everything is quite small to thing of it. And, it is not located at a very convenient area, as in everything around the hotel is under construction... You can walk, but it's not scenic to walk at all... Maybe this is why their rate is much lower than other hotels...

One last thing, we spent everyday a good hour at the gym so we could keep up with our workout routines and I think 3 times I had to message the hotel to get more towels and water. Their gym has a nice view but they have really old free weights (dumbbells) that are super big so it's hard to do workouts with them unless you just use it to lift. Their hot tub/jacuzzi is not really hot at all and it was not working one of the days we were there. Once it was working, it was not really hot..

*CRISPY BEAN CURD (Foraged mushrooms, succotash of spring vegetables, yellow capsicum agro dolce). Nope not crispy, in fact, it was even hard to cut the skin. 

*AAA BEEF TENDERLOIN (Port wine-braised shallot, pressed potato, Espresso jus, tender vegetables). Love the beef and the shallots. Potatoes could use more seasoning/salt but this dish is good overall.

Pedro, the manager, helped us to make our anniversary so very special.

946,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"This is the best hotel in Richmond. The building itself is great, the beds are comfortable, it's clean and the location is convenient. But all of that is eclipsed by the staff, and the little things they do to make you feel welcome. I have stayed at about 10 different hotels between yvr and downtown over the past year. The Westin Wall Center has by far the most attentive and thoughtful staff I have come across. They greet me by name with a beaming smile, i genuinely look forward to coming ""home"" after a days work. They do little things like putting fresh baked cookies in the lobby in the evening, and theres always fresh coffee and tea in the morning to get me going for the day. I love that i can walk a few minutes to the beautiful dykes, or stroll across the river to some great paths and bike ways toward the designer outlet, or just to see the birdlife on the water. Unlike Vancouver which has some nice places to stay, youre not assaulted by non stop sirens here, for being near the airport it is actually quite peaceful. The Canada Line is very close if you need to go downtown. I just hop on a lime scooter parked just outside for a fun 3 minute ride and Im at the station. The hotel also has a shuttle to the airport which runs regulalry and its a pretty short drive so you wont be late for your flight. This is just a nice place to be, if youre into the gym thing or like going for a swim those facilities are excellent too. Finally if you like plane spotting like me, it doesnt get any better.

948,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"Good hotel deserves a good review. This Westin is better than most hotels I've stayed. The building and the room are new and modern. The elevator is fast. The pool, although pretty small, has a very impressive view and feels clean. We were warmly welcomed by the front desk upon arrival. The bed as one of the most comfortable one in hotels I've stayed. The bathroom was neat, clean, and bright. They offered large bottles of body wash and shampoo which are much better than the personal sized small ones in most other hotels. We didn't hear any noises and I believe they have impressive sound insulation, although this could due to the fact that we were in the club level and we didn't have many neighbors. The parking was reasonably charged.

So why not 5 star?

1. We wasted like 30 minutes and other guests were also delayed due to that undertrained front desk staff. We were told that we had free breakfast for two (which was also stated in the room description). In the morning we double checked at the front desk, but the staff said we didn't have. She took very long time checking, making the line at the front desk very long. She wanted to unblock other guests so she decided to help others first and made us wait there. While we were waiting, another staff came out helping us, and after checking for like 10 seconds she could confirm that we did have free breakfast. 

2. The parking lot was not full, but all the empty spaces were either reserved for residents, or had a cone blocking for valet parking. It is like they offered self parking, but reserved all spaces for valet parking to force people pay more for the service.

950,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"I'll be honest, I came for a quick trip to finalize my Trusted Traveler application, and finding out there was a Westin near the airport? I had to see what they had to offer.

Less than a 10 minute drive from the airport, the hotel is spacious but still feels tucked away. If you're staying here hoping to be near some of the nightlife, or to walk to some fun things to do or eat, this probably isn't the hotel for you. Also, since it is Vancouver, Uber/Lyft still isn't a thing so hailing a taxi or walking will be your modes of transport. There is a Starbucks up the road, if you're willing to walk about 15 minutes.

For me, the hotel was perfect and I loved the views from my room AND the gym. Yes, the gym was fanastic and had quite a bit to offer for those who prefer a varied (cardio and free weights) workout. There's also a swimming pool across from the fitness center. However, getting to the fitness center is literally a trek, and the first time you go you'll feel like you're getting lost. Just be sure NOT to go outside (doors are marked with a warning) as they will lock behind you, and you'll need to make your way around to the front of the hotel.

Side note: there were so many rabbits of all shapes and colors. I've never seen so many in one place. Is this a Vancouver thing? Were they just a fluffy gang I stumbled upon? I may never know.

Since I was only in town for 2 nights, I went with their room service options, and the food was really good. Favorites were the bolognese and creme bruele. Even with the additional fees (tax, gratuity, etc.), with the conversion each meal was at most $20.

An airport shuttle is offered, but double check with the front desk. I left before 7am, so the shuttle was still on their consistent rotation, but they did say after a certain point in the day guests must inform the front desk that they'll need shuttle service.

Airport shuttle took at least 20 minutes, as it stopped at another hotel en route. Depending on how many people and bags those travelers have, it could be lengthy. Plan accordingly/leave yourself enough time to get to the airport, through check-in, and security. Also, the shuttle had to drop us off in a separate section for passenger drop off (from the stop to the check in will add at least 15 minutes of walking).

One negative was the WiFi wasn't the strongest, and I had to resort to using my portable WiFi. This could be a break it for anyone depending on connection for a work trip.",2019-10-03T03:29:17Z,89

When we arrived to the city, I decided to send them a message them to see if my room is available but I was told housekeeping was still working on it. Got to the hotel about 45 mins later and my friend and I checked in at the same time but separately.  A room was ready for her and not for me. Normally I wouldn't have cared but she is not an Elite member and I am. So I kinda felt being a Gold Elite was no big deal. And checking in early on the app was no big deal at  this hotel. When I asked the gentleman why my friend got early check in and I didn't, I was told that they were getting me a top floor. Well guess what. My friend was on the 10th, I was on the 11th.
So they weren't working too hard on getting me a top floor.

The room I was in was a corner room and it had a view of the construction across the street. Thee was a Thank You  note on the bed with two pieces of white chocolates.

The room is well appointed and well kept. Location though maybe a problem as it is though walkable to Skytrain  Stations and Richmond Business Area for Chinese Food but it is quite far if you walking in the rain on a cold fall night.... 

Getting downtown is quite convenient using Skytrain. But if you going to spend most of your time downtown, I would suggest forget about staying here.

Their heavenly beds and robes made our stay super comfortable. Plus, such modern and chic decor! The gym and the pool were beautiful! Lots of treadmills and huge windows so you can look out into the sunset while you run/swim. Really nice sunsets, by the way, especially since you can see airplanes landing in the horizon. 

We had the option to opt out of housekeeping, and they would give us back $5 per day. Good for the environment.

My kids love using their pool and hot tub, always try to swim at least once during our stay. Usually for 2 or 3 nights per trip. Downside is the walk to the pool is quite far.

960,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"This hotel is great!  Located near the airport, but only a 20-30 minute ride the Granville Island. 

The staff- so kind and welcoming. 
The rooms- super comfy beds. So ""heavenly"". The bathroom had a really great soaker tub and a robe to put on after. They have a garbage can, recycle bin, AND a compost bin IN THE ROOM. So awesome that they do this!
The pool/gym- it's a little bit of a maze to get there, but a fun one. I'm not sure how you do it if you cannot climb stairs since the doors on the 4th floor don't have a key fob. The gym is a weird shape but has tons of equipment and a great view. The indoor pool is a pretty large size and there is a hot tub too. Both offer a great view of the city. You have to enter through the locker rooms to get there. 
Room service- yes, we tried it. Then we did it again!  The staff running it was super kind. All of the food offered is healthy and all sounded delish!

What we ate: since we were o it there for the late afternoon and dinner time, we had a cheese pizza which was fine for our two kids to share. It was a thin crust and tasty. Then e we ordered the kids prawn rice roll which was three rice paper rolls with shrimp, cucumber, carrot, and rice noodles. It came with dipping sauce, but the sauce was a bit too spicy for the kids. We also got the kids hummus and veggies plate. The hummus was a little on the chunky side, but tasted fine. It came with pita, carrots, and celery. We also got the prawn and arugula salad off the main menu which was light and tasty. Honestly, I could have eaten a bunch of items like the veggie risotto and whole wheat pasta with mushrooms and spinach. I just wasn't that hungry  we also had some local IPAs which were crisp and flavorful as well. 
Airport shuttle: we had to take the 4:05 AM shuttle. Super early morning. The shuttle was on time and roomie. We picked up from one other location before heading to the airport. Super easy.",2020-01-02T14:04:44Z,89

Not a big mistake to us-- we just went down and asked to be moved.   We then went out to lunch and came back about 2 hours later and were given a new room. The new room was wonderful- clean and on the corner of the building with a wonderful view of the river and the airport itself. Even better was the wine and macrons that the front desk sent up to apologize for the mishap. A true class act. 

The hotel itself is pretty new and clean.  The fitness center and pool are gigantic and super bright.  If you like Asian food it is within a 10 min walk of Aberdeen ctr which has lots of great restaurants and food courts. If you need to be close to the airport and the Asian food this is a fine place to stay.  Just be aware that you're a good 10 min walk from the light rail stop and the mall.",2016-04-26T02:03:19Z,89

968,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"I enjoyed my stay here as a getaway with my sisters. 

Price: I scored a good deal on this hotel from Priceline--$80 plus tax, totaling approximately $106.00 a night.  However, the parking brings it up a tad bit more--$20 for self-park in the garage or $30 for valet. I supposed when you valet, your car would be parked right in front of the hotel. =)

Check-In/Out Service: 10++ everything was smooth sailing, just as I love. 

Amenities: Negative star for the gym.  I had high expectations on this gym after viewing the pictures. The machines weren't functioning well.  We weren't able to use the setting as selected. Grr. It was quite a workout, getting the gym because it was tucked away in another corner of the building. They don't have a sauna, but with the windows and hot sun beaming in the woman's locker room, it sure feel like a sauna. =P Free complimentary wifi in the room. *woot woot*

Surrounding:  This hotel shares a common area with the condo next to it--and it's located next to Comfort Inn and it's in an industrial area, full of auto body shops.  Kind of out of place for a 4-star hotel, but whatever, it works. 

Room: AMAZING! the bed was super comfortable. LOVE the bathroom, it has a bath tub and shower. Super cool.

971,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"This would be 4 stars if you don't have a pet, but 3 stars if you do, and since this is billed as a pet-friendly hotel, I'm judging them as such. If you're pet-free then it's a decent luxury hotel with gorgeous extra-deep tubs and comfortable beds. 

If you're bringing a pet, however, you won't find it particularly well designed for pet use (or at all, in fact). It's just a standard hotel that's decided to accept pets, but without apparently making any accommodations for them. 

- the paving outside the main door is lots of small tiles, which means if you have a pet in a rolling carrier, they are subjected to a very loud, scary, and bouncy ride over the tiles unless you pick up and carry the whole thing.
- the check in process wasn't particularly efficient and didn't prioritize pets in any way, if there's a line you have to simply wait with your scared, unhappy pet in a loud crowded foyer.
- the rooms are not pet friendly. The beds are about half a foot off the floor, which is quite enough room for a scared pet to hide under them and not enough room for you to be able to fit under and get them out again. I wonder how many people have been late checking out because they couldn't extract their pet from under the bed?
- carpets are never ideal when you have pets, and I can't imagine they are well vacuumed regularly under the bed since it's hard to move and low to the ground. 
- no offer to supply bedding for your pet, if desired
- no offer to supply food/water bowls, a litter box or pee pads for pets, or even to make them available for purchase on site
- no cleaning implements provided, so if your pet DOES have an accident or spill food or litter or whatever, what are you supposed to do? Clean it up with a towel?? All rooms hosting pets should have a dustpan and brush, cleaning wipes, and paper towels available.

Not well designed for pets at all, really. I'd call this a ""pet tolerating"" hotel, definitely not a ""pet friendly"" one. 

Other non-pet-related things I disliked:
- not very environmentally friendly: they kept the room blasting 18C air conditioning just so they can put 2 layers of duvets on the bed to look luxurious. How about thinner covers and then you don't need to chill your guests quite so severely?
- snacks available in the main foyer but you had to pay at the front desk, which frequently had a line of waiting people 
- the breakfast buffet is way overpriced at $25 for the pretty average quality of food available. Definitely not worth this price, order a la carte instead unless you're after sheer volume.
- ordered an eggs Benedict ""medium"" softness and it was so runny the whites were still partially soft. If this had been any less cooked it would still have been in the shell. (Pointed this out when the server asked how things were, and she was nice enough to comp it.)
- at the bar on an early August evening they did have a bit of a fruit fly problem. Little gnats flying around and committing suicide in the wine. I realize these are hard to eliminate entirely at this season, but I hadn't seen it this bad in any other restaurant of bar I've been to recently.

On the plus side:
- beds were comfortable (once I got rid of the ridiculous second duvet and set the temperature to something reasonable)
- bathroom was very nice, with an extra deep tub for soaking that was super luxurious
- I didn't try this, but a sign in the room said they'll provide workout clothes/shoes in your size to use during your stay for about $5, which seems very convenient
- ""healthy"" food and snacks menu, if that's your thing

Overall: fine choice if you have no pet, but be prepared for the above if you do; a pet-friendly AirBnB might be a better option if one's available.",2017-08-13T01:22:40Z,89
972,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"This hotel has been built in an area of the city that is in the infancy of its development, and thus is surrounded by empty lots and construction.

HOWEVER, I wouldn't let that stop you from booking here.  It's very close to YVR, and despite the empty surrounding locations, there are still a number of restaurants very much within walking distance.

Public transit (Canada Line) is about a 5 minute walk in either direction, and the River Rock Casino is as well.

We stayed in a corner room and it was very well laid out, and we were left with the impression the room is bigger than the square footage would suggest.  Incredible views (180 degrees), and very quiet.

Service at the front desk was excellent.

973,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"I really enjoyed my quick stay at the Westin Wall Centre. OMGosh.... The beds are so amazing.  Feels like sleeping in a puffy cloud. I totally need to make my bed into their signature ""Heavenly"" bed. There is a fresh feel with the Modern décor and relaxing calm color scheme all around the hotel and in the rooms. This hotel is a close and easy drive from the Vancouver International Airport (less than 4km away) and also reasonably priced. 

Free Wifi is a great plus. Nice desk area in the room as well, with easy accessible plugs. (If you do a lot of business travel, you can appreciate the need for easily accessible plugs... lol) The radio/alarm clock was super easy to use and offered a dock for your iPod. The Coffee maker with free Starbucks and Tazo tea is a great morning welcome. I also enjoyed the lighted Make-Up mirror in the bathroom, funny how these little things make the stay more delightful.  

They have a nice size gym offering cardio machines, free weights, machines, heated pool and jacuzzi open anytime. The equipment is in great condition and high end. I liked being on the elliptical and having my personal touch screen TV console.  They also have a small restaurant and lounge onsite, which is nice because there is not a big selection of restaurants you can walk to from this location. Parking is around $20 per day. The hotel representatives were all so professional and friendly.

974,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"This is the latest addition to the Starwood hotels family in Richmond area, and this is also the brand new building opened right before the winter Olympics back in 2010.

Location - This is perhaps the worst thing at this hotel.  This hotel is close to the airport but not close to everything else within the walking distance.  Airport shuttle runs about every 30 minutes and its shared with the comfort inn next door. Its about 10-15 minutes walk to the closest sky train station.  If you don't plan to rent a car, this may be a bit difficult for travelers on foot but the parking is also expensive at this property ($20/day) while other hotels in Richmond charges less.  

Lobby - small but clean and inviting.  I got into my room quickly after check in.  The view that I received was the side facing adjacent apartment complex, where you can see your neighbors across the street and others will be able to see you too.

Room - very nice and modern feeling to it.  This is the newer Westin room design.  Heavenly bed is heavenly as usual. Wifi for a fee except in the lobby area.  Separated shower and tub but only one sink. Quiet yet strong AC is always appreciated.  HD TV channels provided.  Housekeeping worked hard to keep the rooms in the new condition.  Good soundproof even its close to the airport but you can not hear much noises.

Gym - have a pool and a gym but they don't have sauna and steam room.  The gym is shared with the apartment next door but clean.  However, they don't seem to clean this area often as you can't find the clean towels at night and the used towels are everywhere on the floor.

Restaurant - tried for their breakfast.  The servers were very friendly, one of the best I have encountered in BC, but the breakfast quality were meh.  Average at best.  Richmond have literally one of the BEST Chinese food options in North America so if you are here, go out and explore the town!

Club Lounge:  They discontinued the food services at club lounge so its still there, but only soft drinks, and that is the only difference at the club floor other than discounted coupon for breakfast and dinner appetizers.  I do not recommend to pay the premium to upgrade to the club floor at this property. 
  
I have chatted with other fellow travelers while at this hotel and seems like you can easily score this hotel on priceline/hotwire when you bid for 4* hotels in BC area.  If you don't mind the location, this is a great place to stay but if location is everything to you, then this is not the place to be.",2012-06-10T18:01:46Z,89

976,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"There are a lot of hotels in Richmond because it's right by the airport - most of the hotels are on the lower price points so nothing spectacular. For me a hotel has to be clean...it has to ""feel"" clean and look clean. This place is definitely clean, partly because it's still a fairly new hotel (opened in Jan 2010). Highlight of the stay and I am being serious, is the bathroom! There's nothing worse than a small and gross looking bathroom. This one is very clean, modern and spacious! There's a separate shower and soaker tub in the bathroom with decent counter space (see my pics)!

Location is a little industrial as it's near some car repair shops but as a young female I felt safe walking at night. Noise was not a problem for me despite being close to the airport. My view was part of the marina and a real close up of the condos next door (make sure you close your curtains before you change!)

Stayed here for vacation in mid-July 2011. Hotel per night was $167 and after taxes was $190 per night. I think it's definitely cheaper in the off season. But even at the rate I paid at, I would definitely return here on my next visit to Richmond/Vancouver.

Pros:
- Bathroom (see my mention above). Good hair dryer - unlike the weak kind you find in some hotels.
- Rooms have modern designs - clean and fresh feel. Sheets were clean.
- Safe area despite being somewhat industrial in immediate area. Close walk to shopping and restaurants on No. 3 Road, though it is nearly all Chinese except for the handful of national chains.
- Complimentary bottled water and Starbucks coffee and tea.
- Staff are friendly. The bellhops were fun to chat with and informative.
- Free shuttle to and from the airport (5 min ride). 
- Rated high on trip advisor.

Cons:
- You have to pay for wifi in your room (~$10 for 24 hrs). Free wifi is only in the lobby area (ask staff for access code). Too bad that the lobby has seating for about 5 people at one time.  I just find it odd that they don't add more seating in the perimeter. 
- Parking is about $22 for valet and $15 self-park. I opted to park on the street (just watch the loading zones and fire hydrants) but otherwise, no time limits but just slightly time consuming on the odd night when the area is busy. But it's well worth the effort to save some cash!
- Room is pricey compared to other hotels in the area but this is higher caliber hotel.

Miscellaneous:
- Transportation - about a 10-12 min walk to the sky train (Canada Line) on No. 3 Road and Cambie. Not terribly close if you are carrying lots of things.
- Re: airport shuttle, after you pick up your luggage at the airport, just follow the signs and go to the lower floor to the shuttle waiting area. Shuttle came approximately on the hour and half hour to the airport. Shuttles from the hotel to the airport comes by the hotel at 15 mins past the hour and 45 mins past the hour. 
- Closest gas station is Domo on No. 3 Road also the lowest priced one compared to the Chevron I used on Garden City Road and Cambie.
- Tim Hortons and Starbucks are about a block or two away from hotel but in different directions.
- Walkable distance (5-10 mins depending on destination) to Yaohan (grocery store and Chinese food court) and T&T in the President's Plaza, and Aberdeen Centre (Asian mall).",2011-07-24T08:09:31Z,89
977,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"Don't stay here if you're looking for a good sleep. 
First off, the check in staff was really friendly. That's what this hotel has going for it. But it went downhill pretty fast from there. 
When we arrived in the room, it was extremely humid. We opened a window to dehumidify, and that worked for a while. 
The bed was awful. It was hard and noisy. Because it was hard, it meant that we rolled over frequently throughout the night to prevent getting sore. But because it was a noisy bed, it would wake the other up. That, mixed with the fact that the doors are extremely loud (they sound like they're getting slammed), meant that we barely slept at all. 
Because the night market was a block away, it meant we couldn't keep the window open throughout the night, so it meant it kept getting hot and humid. 
We ended up ""sleeping"" late because we were so exhausted, and that made us get to breakfast around 9:30. Don't get the buffet. It felt like everything was sat out for way too long. The chicken was chewy, the pancakes were stale, the hash browns were soft. 
When checking out, the person at the front desk asked how our stay was, so we explained everything. They didn't seem to care. Their response was simply that it's probably time to change out the mattress. In my opinion, it's probably time to change out a lot about this hotel.

Now that we've dispelled the rather aspirational name of this property, let's do that review thing.  This is an actual, modern Westin hotel with proximity to YVR.  The rooms, facilities, and staff are all of a very high quality (certainly top tier in the Richmond area) and I enjoyed my stay here.  The major downside of this property is the location. This hotel really has the suburban pioneer spirit going on as it is smack dab on the middle of some very industrial looking real estate.  It IS walking distance to most of main drag in Richmond and to public transport as well, but I did here more than a few rumbles and grumbles from my fellow guests.  Frankly,had I not scored such a major discount on the room rate, I may have joined in on a chorus or two.

I didn't actually sleep here as I booked it for my Aunt and Mom, but enjoyed the amenities.

The hotel itself is only a few years old. Check in was fast and friendly. Beds were ultra soft and comfy. Bathroom had a massive 4-person glass shower and overall designed well.

The pool/fitness centre is pretty wicked. You can watch planes land and bask in the glorious sun facing the river.

From the moment we walked into the lobby, the carpets, the seating in the restaurant, the lobby restrooms, the hallway and hotel room floors, bathroom and even bedding were all neglected and filthy. Disgraceful! It's an airport hotel, so we were there just to catch a morning flight, but it does not live up to basic expectations of Westin. The hotel has potential, with new materials and finishes throughout but all so very neglected (not from age but from poor maintenance).

990,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"How can you go wrong w/ a Westin.  Built just in time for the vancouver olympics.

A 2-tower complex, one for residential & other hotel.

Can vouch for the rooms, despite good bedding & all, the rooms were not as spacious as Bayshore's by Stanley Park.

Washroom-wise, it's a nice treat here: clean, 3 stalls, double counters & it's a great emergency stop when you're in this area where there's no shopping mall nearby.  

A bit tricky to go undetected since it seems slow most of the time when you enter the lobby, the front desk will stare you down but if you walk towards the restaurant & pretend to look at the menu, then you can make a hasty retreat to the left.

Nice that they have a big tv screen letting you know when the flights have arrived/departed.

Believe that was free coffee/tea on a table in the corner too.

If I'm a tourist though, wouldn't really stay here since it's kinda of in a no-man's land; just car dealership & bottle recycling depot.  Other than being close to the casino which i suppose is a 15mn. walk through a major intersection, I'd recommend the Hilton/Sheraton area by Minoru blvd.",2013-01-10T03:02:57Z,89

I was a little bummed since I enjoyed watching the Sky Train come and go and planes line up for landing.  But that worked out, since the Richmond Night Market was going on.  The music carried over and when you are trying to get a toddler to sleep, quite distracting.  

I'm pretty much used to the location by now.  Darling daughter loves the pool once again and finally took notice of the living wall in the parking circle.  Pretty impressive stuff but I wonder what they'll do with it once living walls are out of style.

We were treated to a Cops-like experience when someone landed their vehicle sideways in the lot of the nearby hotel.  There is always something interesting to watch at this hotel but this took the cake.  It took 2 tow trucks to upright the car.  Good times.",2012-10-01T23:12:52Z,89

However, with Westin brand in mind, this hotel delivers what is expected: great customer service, nice clean building, heavenly bed very comfortable soft bedding.

The hotel is also located so closed to No. 3 Road this means so easy to drive to nearby resaturants or DT Vancovuer.

993,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"As a former platinum SPG member I expected nothing but top quality from Westin.  for the most part I got it.  

Most importantly the room; it was great. The beds in Westin's are always soft, the rooms clean and water bottles were free. There were plenty of towels and all the typical necessities were in place.  The room was very well put together.  

The staff was fantastic.  Specifically Jessica in the bar; I and my travel buddies had the chance to meet her on her first day of work.  Bright smile and sparkling personalty.  If it wasn't for her guidance our time in Vancouver/Richmond would have not been anywhere near as fun.  She told us her favorite spots and places to see.  Rather than list a bunch of places she said go here and let me know how it was.  We took her advice on everything and nothing disappointed!  If you have the chance to talk with her it will be time well spent.  As a fellow international traveler, it was nice to talk with someone who had been where I had and in some cases more.  The desk staff was just as helpful in directing us to the Sky Track, checking us in early and accommodating some room changes. Overall the staff was top notch!

Normally I refuse to eat at restaurants at hotels; normally they are poor quality.  The Apron, as it is named, is not one of those.  I only had breakfast here so I cannot attest to the quality of lunch or dinner. But breakfast was great.  At Jessica's suggestion I went with the Eggs Benny and they were spot on; has to be the best thing on the menu!

Here is why the Westin lost a star.  All four of us had issues with the temperature in the room. I am the only one who didn't end up moving because of the heat, I muscled it out mostly because once I settle I don't want to pack up.   The rooms upon arrival were freakishly hot; like satan just visited and forgot to take hell with him. Even with the AC turned down all the way it took 24 hours for the room to cool.   All three of my travel buddies had to change rooms because of how bad it was.  Being bigger guys I could only imagine what it must of looked like as the stumbled downstairs in the middle of the night, drenched is sweat and wrapped in a white sheet.  Ok that didn't really happen but the sweat part was real and so was the room changes.  

Overall the room was as good as a typical Westin outside of the temperature snafu. The staff is what really makes this place though.  Great group at all hours of the day and night.  With my flight and meeting times I think I met the whole crew and they were all great people.  

I wouldn't be afraid to stay here again; maybe in the winter though as I know my room will be pre heated ;)",2014-04-15T18:28:10Z,89

Bed was very comfortable, room was pretty quiet, was set up comfortably and the bathroom was really well appointed and totally new.  The room was extremely clean.  

Food was decently good.  I stayed at the Radisson prior to that, and the Westin blows it away. 

Of course realize the area you are in, it's not the nicest, prettiest area, if you are not there for business or to be as close to the airport as possible I would suggest staying elsewhere.

Although I'm not too flattered about having to pay for wifi in my room, I rather have it free up in my room than to repeatedly go down to the lobby to look up a location. Note, you can only use the wifi in the lobby for a maximum of 2 hours a day. I also like that they provide a tv screen telling you when flights have arrived or departed. 

The beds were amazing, I had no problem falling asleep on it. The washrooms were really clean and the room was very well cleaned up every time. Although on our last stay, the maid who cleaned our room didn't bother replacing new shampoo and conditioning bottles. 

When we went down to the 5th level, there was an awesome fitness centre, it looked really clean, but sadly we didn't go in because we were there to have a swim. When we went into the pool and took a dive, it was disgusting. On the website, it was said that the pool was not salty, and when I licked my lips, it tasted salty. I was beginning to wonder if anyone had peed in the pool. But whatever, the change room was at least clean and had a shower with soap and we cleaned ourselves off. I wasn't expecting to have such a short swim. 

The location of the hotel was good, wasn't the best because we didn't have the brightest view or the prettiest, but I really liked how it was close to the Aberdeen Centre, the new night market, Yaohan and the Sky Train station.

It was our first time in the area and everyone was very helpful with directions and information on transportation. The only area that could use some improvement was the room service.

We were here for the Richmond Night Market and was happily surprised that it's nearby. The front desk person was very nice - Patrick. He moved us to a King bed room with a view of the Delta. And away from noisy ice machines and elevators. I like my peace and quiet. The other Yelpers are correct that the pool is quite a hike. It's down a couple of hallways on the 5th floor. But it seemed warm, I don't think it's heated at all but not bad. The gym was upgraded with some free weight dumb bells. But the lifters will be disappointed as it's more for the cardio enthusiasts. Overall, not a bad hotel. Try Priceline bid and you may get it on the cheap. 100/night. You can't beat that for the time of the year on a Sat one night stay.",2015-09-12T23:34:35Z,89

1002,"The Westin Wall Centre, Vancouver Airport",4.0,"I like this hotel. It is because of several things. We booked two rooms for about one week. Room 710 and 806. I like this hotel because your car is just a few yards away from the entrance and the elevator is just a few steps and it can take you straight up to your floor. You do not need to walk for yards and yards like the big hotels. It's convenient and close especially for older people who cannot walk far. They also had fresh fruit in the lobby and in the evening great assortment of cookies to eat. The people were very very nice,especially the person who worked on Tuesday, May 28th on the 15th floor. It was a little slow that night and she took the time to talk to us and tell us about some places to eat that we went to. She was very friendly. I also want to say that at breakfast the person working up there works very hard during the busy time and several of the hotel guest were talking and felt she was overworked (she was working very fast) and sometimes when it's busy she should be able to call for some help. The bagels (you could improve on the type of bagel, not soft enough)were not cut and trying to cut them with a butter knife was exasperating. The room service was sometimes excellent as my family was messy. Only a couple times things were not right but when we called for service they were very prompt to resolve our problem or complaint. Overall the rooms were nice clean and suited our needs. Also this hotel is close to a lot of places to eat and shopping mall, etc.etc. Fyi try eating dim sum at Fisherman ....(sorry can't remember rest of name ) but it is in Aberdeen square. It was comparable to places in Hong Kong ,go early because it is very crowded. Also for matcha dessert we thought, Tsujiri, was excellent but slightly pricey.

The restaurant is small but looks like it serves up top quality food in a pleasing atmosphere.

However on a romantic getaway as I was on with my fiancee this was a poor choice for a hotel.  It is too near the airport and the area around it is very industrial.  The view outside our room was a large cement factory. Also we had to walk to get to the train station to head downtown and see the sights.  At the train station is another hotel/casino which I think we should have stayed out instead as that would have made things much more convenient as both hotels had shuttles from the airport and would have helped us avoid having to rent a car or walk long distances.

So, if you're there on business, excellent choice, if you are a tourist then I'd recommend another hotel near some of the transit points or sights you are likely to want to see.",2010-08-17T18:50:41Z,89

The hotel was great (4.5 stars on some sites) though the location was only a mere so so.  Located in the outskirts of Richmond, BC there wasn't a whole lot to do around there.  It's about a 15 minute walk from the train station to downtown which is roughly a 20 minute ride to City Center.  The train station is right next to a Casino which is great if you're into that sort of thing.  We were also lucky enough to be in Richmond one of the weekends the Richmond Night Market (not to be confused with the Summer Night Market) which is pretty much located right next to the Casino.  Tons of food to be bought here at the booth style restaurant vendors.  A lot of other vendors selling random junk too.  When I say junk, I am not stretching the truth too much.  You can get anywhere from a fake adult Pikachu outfit to a telescopic police baton.  

Anyway, I would highly recommend the Westin Wall Centre hotel if you're trying to be cost conscious and you don't want to stay in a dump.  The downtown Vancouver, BC hotels of similar caliber would be closer to 3 times the price what we paid to stay here.",2012-09-05T04:44:09Z,89

I've stayed at several hotels, but by far this was the WORSE.  The whole time we stayed there we didn't have a good feeling about the place anymore because of that one guy being so rude to us when we enter.  If I spend $150/night, I think maybe I deserve a little respect? I will never come back to westin again.",2010-09-29T06:56:41Z,89

1029,Shangri-La,4.3,"Slow elevators that you need to take to get to the restaurant, lobby, your room, or the spa because they're all on different floors.

The restaurant sucks. The waitress tried to slip in upsells like asking if we wanted bread for the table and then charged $5 for the bread. She also asked if we wanted more sides and if we were sure when we said no. 

Their espresso machine was broken and they had none of the pillows available from their pillow menu.",2022-06-01T19:53:53Z,106
1030,Shangri-La,4.3,Great visit and five star service. The only place we will stay in Vancouver. We stayed in the balcony suite and it was more than enough space. Perfect amenities!,2023-11-26T16:33:30Z,106
1031,Shangri-La,4.3,"Nice overnight here. Close to shopping, great rooms, very solid service by all staff. Book on AMEX Travel if you are a Platinum card holder and you will get 4pm check out, $100 property credit, room upgrade, and breakfast for two included. We had an evening snack and dessert, valet parked, and had breakfast, and the credit covered all that. The breakfast is great. Bed very comfortable. Nespresso in room, which may not matter to many people but is a big plus for us when we stay places and like to unwind without having to leave or order coffee. I would stay here again for a Vancouver stay and recommend it!",2022-06-20T22:09:26Z,106

1033,Shangri-La,4.3,"The location was great as it is within walking distance to a lot of restaurants. I liked the atmosphere of the place- calm. The lobby wasn't noisy and full of people. Something I noticed right away when waiting to check in was a nice light scent that was also found in our room. Apparently, you can purchase the scent in the form of a fragrance oil, candle, room spray, or diffuser. 

When we went to our room, we found a handwritten note with a pastry. The bed and pillows were really comfortable. The big bathroom with the L'Occitane toiletries was nice. Bottled water was provided daily or you can have coffee using the Nespresso machine or make tea. When we checked out, the kids got a small teddy bear. All of the nice touches were noticed and appreciated. The only negative thing I can think of is there is some noise from the AC. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and hopefully will stay at a Shangri-La again!",2022-05-10T03:52:49Z,106
1034,Shangri-La,4.3,"One of the worst establishments I've had the pleasure of staying in. 

The staff insults your intelligence by notifying you that you've received and upgrade (from a King room) to a twin room then tell you they have no inventory to change. In my opinion, if they do this, you should chargeback for failure to deliver service.

I understand the brand appeal but you are much better staying at any Fairmont, Four Seasons or JW Marriott. Rooms do not seem clean and service is dismal.

Would stay away at all costs",2023-09-13T01:35:17Z,106

Luckily they sell diffusers of the scent so you can bring it home with you. Service was top notch, everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful. The room was beautiful and comfortable. The one bedroom suite comes with a balcony right off the bedroom. Which was nice at night, kept the door open while I slept which allowed a crisp cool breeze into the room and helped me sleep like a baby. I will definitely be back here on my next trip!",2022-09-20T06:33:48Z,106
1036,Shangri-La,4.3,"I had a pretty big credit on Hotels.com.  Even with that, I would never stay at a fancy hotel like this, because well, I probably still couldn't afford it.  Well, because of the pandemic (I stayed the weekend before everything was shut down), the price was a lot cheaper.  I still had to pay, but less than a hundred dollars for a room that is normally $400-$500.  Works for me!  I can see how rich people live.  LOL!

The entrance was a little hard to find as it seemed like it was down an alley.  But, I was still able to find it on my first try.  I don't believe there is a self-park option, so I just had the valet take care of it.  Parking in downtown Vancouver can be somewhat of a nuisance, so I just took the easy route.  And plus, most of the places I wanted to go to were within walking distance.

Check in was easy and friendly.  I got up to my room pretty fast as I was pretty tired after the flight to Seattle and drive up to Vancouver.  Let me say, the room was pretty nice.  True, it's not a huge room, however the amenities were really nice.  There was a separate living room, along with a nice bed in the bedroom and a very elegant bathroom.  The nicer touches were the automated features such as one-touch shades and lights all over the room.  If the room was a little bit bigger, I could totally see why people would pay for this kind of luxury.  As for me, unless it was a great deal, I don't think I could afford staying here again.  But, that's not saying that I didn't enjoy my stay, because I did.",2020-10-27T19:18:02Z,106
1037,Shangri-La,4.3,"We stayed at the Shangri-La Vancouver for a short minimoon after our wedding and it was such an incredible experience. 

Easily the best service we have ever received in a hotel. We were especially impressed seeing as we originally booked our reservation through in a third-party booking website and that did not alter the level of service we received. When we checked in we were recommended an upgraded room for a small additional amount per night and it was absolutely worth it! We had a corner room with stunning windows and balcony! 

Fung, at the concierge desk, made our experience particularly special. She helped us with numerous things, including finding our way around Stanley Park and getting us a prime reservation at one of the best sushi restaurants on a Friday night! 

Lastly, the outdoor heated pool and spa are located on the 5th floor and even in the cold rainy weather was so relaxing!",2021-10-30T15:54:54Z,106
1038,Shangri-La,4.3,"We stayed at the Shangri-La Vancouver for about a week during the 2021 Christmas holidays and we couldn't be happier with our choice.

Although there were a couple of hiccups during check-in, the issues were quickly resolved by a very professional on-duty manager. We ended up getting upgraded to a one bedroom suite.

What we liked:
-professional staff: everyone we interacted with was cordial and resourceful; we were treated very well and we appreciated hotel staff going out of their way to rectify certain minor issues
-the suite was beautiful, especially the lavish marble-clad bathroom with double vanity sink and mirror-embedded television
-central location of the hotel
-in-room private dining for breakfast: we ordered something different every morning: stuffed croissant, house congee, eggs benedict, frittata, french toast, etc.)

What we didn't like:
-Suite had a weird layout and there was no closet in the foyer area: nowhere to hang your coat when you enter
-Nespresso machine malfunctioned almost half the time
-Hotel restaurant (Carlino) is not worth it for dinner: portions were measly and the entrees were served with the bare minimum (for example: we were surprised that their pasta did not come with bread by default)
-in-room dining all day menu: we tried their striploin steak and rigatoni and were not impressed at all.

Overall, this was a pleasant stay and we would stay here again.",2022-01-01T19:03:26Z,106
1039,Shangri-La,4.3,"Wow wow wow! Excellent service and excellent food. Had a scrumptious 5 course meal and from the salad (with watermelon) to the soup that gets poured in front of you with the butter already in the bowl and then you stir, to the the green tea cake. YUM! And the serving staff in their uniforms were classy looking and on top of it. Not sure if it goes with the theme, but all workers I saw were Asian....... the washrooms are clean and beautiful. The balconies have amazing views. Parking is about $12-14 all night and valet is $16 so going valet makes sense. So impressed!",2016-08-11T04:25:02Z,106
1040,Shangri-La,4.3,"This is luxury and has definitely won and deserves the five star diamond award. The staff bend over backwards to accommodate requests and what not. However, my only complaint would be the check in time, it says three ... Meaning not a minute sooner. This has happened twice. Although they did take our bags so we could grab a nice lunch instead of waiting in the lobby. Also rented two rooms, one had items, such as a welcome note, one did not. No welcome gift either, for the price you pay ...you almost expect it. Bathrooms are wonderful with televisions and ample towels.  Beds are comfortable and they provide you with great pillow options. But my favourite part..... Room service is to die for. It is exactly what you would get from the restaurants. Many hotels offer mediocre room service at best and small portions. Not here!  You won't be disappointed, try the cheesecake for a late night dessert. Loved this hotel, always have.",2014-12-30T19:09:54Z,106
1041,Shangri-La,4.3,Great location. Nice bar attached to the hotel. Seemed to be a good pick up spot if you're single. Great gym. Very clean. Bed was comfortable.,2012-09-18T02:36:16Z,106
1042,Shangri-La,4.3,"Feels like a small boutique, but actually perfect size and great location for shopping, pier, park, and dining.  The room was spacious. Wifi is free unlike Hyatt or Ritz.  Service was excellent throughout, and concierge was personal, prompt, and knowledgable. Centrally located, convenient, and very quiet.  Even the gym staff was personal, courteous, and professional - but left me alone as well.  Swim pool is small, not good for lap pool but adequate for splash or kids playing or dipping. Tend to be more Asian guests with less children.  Next to Burberry store which I suppose could be good or bad.  I will come back again - and made me curious about other locations.",2012-08-29T05:59:10Z,106
1043,Shangri-La,4.3,"The Shangri-La Vancouver was fantastic. Excellent service, excellent amenities and excellent food. As other people have mentioned, definitely try the French Toast for breakfast at the Market restaurant. They are ridiculous; soaked overnight in buttermilk, lightly fried, crispy and fluffy. I had them twice. 

The rooms are very well appointed with buttons that control all of the lights and shades. The staff were very friendly and the concierge was extremely helpful in making my visit a memorable one. 

Location-wise, the Shangri-La is perfectly located for walking around and getting to see all that Downtown Vancouver has to offer. Less than 20 minutes walk to Stanley Park, Gastown, Davie Street and Yaletown, and a block away from Robson Street (Vancouver's version of 5th Avenue, not to be confused with Vancouver's 4th Avenue, another top shopping area in Kitsilano). 

I also made use of the hotel's house car (a sleek white Mercedes) which is available to take guests wherever they want locally on a first-come basis. It came in very handy when we were going to dinner a bit further away and for getting to Granville Island (another cool place to check out in Vancouver). 

The hotel is in every sense a 5-star establishment and with all of the perks and amenities available, I recommend that if visiting Vancouver you should try to stay at this class-act.",2013-02-03T01:22:11Z,106
1044,Shangri-La,4.3,"Stayed at various locations within Vancouver (Sutton, Opus, Met, Westin Grand) and this hotel is easily my favorite.  It's relatively new, very clean, and in the middle of everything.  The restaurant in the hotel is quiet too.",2010-09-13T18:41:33Z,106
1045,Shangri-La,4.3,"Got a sweet deal on two nights last week.  The room was very neat and well decorated.  The massage we got at their spa was excellent, and Jarren at the concierge desk was fantastic - recommended a delicious brunch spot, helped us locate the bus stop we needed for the ferry, and also was able to recommend a clean tattoo parlor that took us last-minute without an appointment because he had called ahead for us.  Thanks Jarren!",2011-04-26T02:15:26Z,106
1046,Shangri-La,4.3,"The service at this hotel is exceptional. I must give special attention to the concierge Karin and Benjamin. They couldn't be any more professional, detailed, helpful and caring.

1047,Shangri-La,4.3,"A seriously luxe hotel in the heart of downtown Vancouver. The room we stayed in was large, contemporary, comfortable, and stylish. The bathroom in particular is excellent, with complete amenities provided, separate shower and bath, dual wash basins, and a separate toilet which is a nice touch. Although it rained during our stay, the balcony is sizeable and serene. During the summer, you could spend a wonderful evening looking out onto the streets below and having a drink. The staff is completely courteous and a pleasure to talk to. They work very hard to ensure that your stay is wonderful. The only downsides is that the hotel occupies the lower floors of the building so it is impossible to get a room with full city views. Also, my family had lunch at the restaurant on the first floor and it took 2 hours from when we were seated to when we left. We had ordered simply and I was disappointed at how long the whole thing took as we were looking forward to spending our time exploring the city. The food was also nothing to write home about, but certainly not bad either. Other quck perks- a well stocked mini bar including full bottles of wine, complimentary basic wireless, and a second, lower lobby attached to the parking garage which was quite peaceful considering it is underground.",2009-03-15T01:45:48Z,106
1048,Shangri-La,4.3,"First and foremost this hotel is very hard to find the entrance.   We must have passed it several times as there is NO street level reception.  You must enter through the parking garage where you find the entire front reception area underground (skylights and see through elevator for small amount of natural light).  This was a bit odd and not too welcoming.  Staff were very friendly the whole time and took great care in their guests.  From the reception area to hallways to the pool - think small.  At times the elevator waiting area and hallways just seemed cramped especially when other people are passing through.  We had a standard king room selected which was fine.  And my favorite part - the bathroom.  Amazing.  Always a top on my list when paying for a 5 star hotel.  I could have just stayed in the bathroom the entire time LOL.  A pleasant surprise we had unknowingly had a complimentary breakfast included with our room purchase.  This was really nice for the day we left and the food was top notch.  No buffet, just waiters that knew your name and let you order off their specific menu.  Unlimited food I might add.  The standard check out time of noon was pleasant as rushing to get ready and leave was a non-issue. I had booked this through Expedia which sometimes can be a no-no as you loose certain perks when staying but the Shang did a great job!",2014-06-13T17:06:28Z,106
1049,Shangri-La,4.3,"Our family really enjoyed this hotel! The location was perfect, the room was very clean (a bit worn here & there but very well kept), service was wonderful. We had an issue with our lock, called front desk and they had a technician came up in less than 5 mins - now that's service!!! We called front desk several times and each time was met with smiling, happy employees. A lot of money was spent for our short 2 night stay, but was worth the quiet, and the luxurious feel. Only real complaint was the lighting system. It was so confusing I ended up shining a bright light on my husband in the morning as he was sleeping...and the bathroom could use better ventilation. Location was amazing! High end stores right downstairs, easy to walk around and get a feel for the city. First time in Vancouver and so happy we booked this hotel!!",2022-09-06T22:19:33Z,106
1050,Shangri-La,4.3,"Not bad for a three star hotel- pretty bad for a five star. 

Hotel staff don't know their own policies or seem to understand the finer levels of customer service going up to the general manager. Very unimpressed. Won't be staying at the Shangri-La in Vancouver again and probably will avoid the brand.

Dealing with the staff and corporate office is pretty kafkaesque and seems to be done in bad faith. Overall they just seem to be lacking in professionalism. To me the primary differentiation between a good hotel and a bad hotel is the staff. 

I get the impression they think they're too good for the customer. Not a good way to get a return visit. 

Shower pressure is also pretty bad. 

I'd recommend either of the Fairmonts over the Shangri-La to anyone who wants to enjoy their stay in Vancouver.",2022-02-01T05:48:31Z,106
1051,Shangri-La,4.3,"A small boutique hotel that is comprised mostly of residential suites. The lobby is small and the main entrance by car is in the basement. We were provided with plenty of boxed water throughout our 8 day stay. Room service meals were unappetizing, and we tried eating it three times. Location was nice and close to restaurants and stores. We rented a car and had valet parking which was great. The best thing was the Starbucks right around the corner, connected to a small supermarket. The bathroom was the nicest thing in our room, but the king bed was comfortable. The elevators need to be renovated- it looked quite shoddy and showing it's age. Overall, staff were very courteous and very friendly, however, the hotel and amenities are not as nice as other Shangri-La's and definitely should not be 5 star.",2023-02-12T01:46:48Z,106
1052,Shangri-La,4.3,"Beautiful hotel in a great location with great service all around. We spent one evening here while passing through Vancouver and wished we'd arrived earlier to take advantage of the pool and spa. There was a hand-written note and a snack waiting for us in our room which was a nice treat. 

That said, we selected this hotel because they advertise a Tesla destination charger. Your charging options are to self-park in the garage for $35 with a 3 hour charging limit (and then are required to move your car) or you can valet with the hotel for $50/night and they will charge you at their tesla charger. The $50 valet fee seemed outrageous to me-- so just be aware if you are in the same boat we are.

Otherwise, a great stay and would stay here again.",2019-12-03T18:16:56Z,106

This is An underwhelming "" luxury "" property .
The pool area  facilities are very small and cannot accommodate enough people compared to the size of the hotel.  The rooms are nice and what you'd expect from a 4 starts property. THERE is NO electrical plugs by the beds ! Haven't seen this ever.  No real restaurant to speak ok and the lobby is more of a 3 stars hotel.  The upgrade to a executive deluxe for 100$ a night has you wondering what the base deluxe room is !?

The location is prime and puts you within walking distance to just about everything, including all the restaurants and shops on Robson St. The lobby and elevators are quite small, but the suite we were in was exceptional. Hands down, the most spacious hotel room I've ever stayed in. The bathroom was enormous and they use L'Occitane products, which I enjoyed. They offer turn down service, free bottles of water, and awesome overall service. The only downside is there's no ice machine.

Overall, we didn't mind the lack of amenities, as the suite was luxurious enough for us.",2017-07-24T20:27:54Z,106
1055,Shangri-La,4.3,"I generally like the Shangri-la. The service is usually exceptional though the hotel is relatively expensive. The Vancouver Shangri-la is perhaps a little less service refined than Shangri-la hotels, but that's sort of reflective of service personnel in Vancouver in general. My last stay here was frustrating as I was shocked to go back to my room and learn that it was unlocked. It turned out that it could be opened even when""bolted""! Not only was this dangerous but it wasted a couple hours of my time dealing with it and I was only offered a slight discount as a compensation for the excessive trouble, which felt like a also in the face.

After complaining, they addressed the issue more appropriately and gave us a free night's stay and upgrade;  there was a bottle of wine in the room and they included breakfast in their restaurant, which was nice. So they addressed the issue at the end.",2019-01-20T00:16:18Z,106

The staff couldn't have been more accommodating for my two little ones. During check in, my littles were getting a little antsy and the front desk staff brought out little stuffed animals for each of my kids. Then they gave us a room at 10:30 am and we were able to use the room all day. They sent cookies up for the littles around 3:30. 

The room is spacious, clean, and inviting.

We got the regular king room with a balcony and although room itself was kinda small, the bathroom was really nice and spacious. Also I really like the vanity table in the room and liked their spacious balcony too.

1058,Shangri-La,4.3,"My wife and I celebrated my birthday in a lovely suite at the Shangri-La Hotel in downtown Vancouver.  If you are in the ""industry,"" and need a discreet, unobtrusive, luxury accommodation while filming in Vancouver, the Shangri-La Hotel is perfect.  The entrance is off a side street, down a ramp, to an understated front.  A bellman mysteriously shows up to help with your bags.  There is no lobby to be seen.  The lobby, which looks more like a large foyer, is on the second floor.  The small check in desk has one person who takes your incidentals, and the elevator takes you up to your floor.  Stick on a baseball cap, slap on some sunglasses, and no one will recognize you at this hotel.  In five days we saw one other person, and that was in the elevator.

However, I'm not George Clooney, and I like to be recognized.  In fact, I'm starved for attention, and I missed having more people around and a fun bar to drink at.  Service was excellent at the Shangri-La, but you needed to search it out.  There was one person at the Lower Level check-in desk and one concierge in the foyer/lobby.  That's it.  I need a rash of folks greeting me when I enter.  It makes me feel so important and wanted..........

We chose this hotel for its zen, modern decor and our room did not disappoint.  The other luxury hotels in Vancouver have rooms that might be called stodgy.  Our room at the Shangri-La was on the fifteenth floor and was huge, with large windows showcasing an urban view.  Our semi enclosed terrace was ""tres"" chic, the bed comfortable, and the closet larger than most New York apartments.  Surprisingly, storage drawers and shelves were lacking, a design misstep.  The bathroom was huge and comforting with its heated floors and separate tub and shower.  It was an amazingly large and comfortable room.

Besides the lack of energy, the other disappointing aspect of the hotel was room service.  While the service was quick and gracious, the food choices were very poor and on a couple of evenings we chose pretzels and potato chips, rather than appease our hunger with what was available from room service.

In spite of the couple of negatives, I would certainly return to the Shangri-La Hotel when we return to fabulous city of Vancouver.  However, I will don a baseball cap, wear dark glasses and pretend to be someone important.",2017-03-21T01:44:22Z,106

Booked this hotel for one night for a sister's weekend in October.  My sisters have now both had to back out because of work projects.  No problem I thought we will reschedule for another time.  I called the hotel in Whistler to cancel our reservations, they couldn't have been more understanding and accommodating, then I called the Shangri-La Hotel.
The person who answered the phone said I would have to go through Expedia since I had made my reservation through them, ok.  I had bought insurance knowing my sisters are very busy so I thought this would be no problem.  Well, Expedia was great and tried several times to get my reservation canceled but ultimately the hotel would not allow me to cancel my reservation that was more than 3 months away.  They said they would allow me to change the date for the one night stay but since I live in South Carolina I will not be traveling alone to stay one night in Vancouver BC, Canada.  They have a no cancellation policy that I missed and since I missed it I just feel that others might miss this too, so I am making it more known with this review.  I am working this out with Expedia since I did buy the insurance but a hotel that doesn't allow cancellations 3 months in advance seems like a hotel I don't need to stay at anyway.

I called to ask politely if I can bring in my dog to visit my family who is staying at the hotel and guess what, pet policy applies, that they will change cleaning fees! This is just a visit! A visit not a stay! 
And the agent on the phone started arguing with me me saying its the policy - once again I repeated, it's a visit and I'm only dropping by and then we will go out for dinner after wards- and she kept arguing and kept repeating that it's policy like I don't understand English. What a service from a hotel claiming to be world class!

Where is the class there?  You certainly failed to the T in what you claim to be! I will be advocating this to all social media channels on how rude and how you have no class in treating pet owners and lovers!

The steak looked absolutely horrific almost like a hamburger patty or a piece of meatloaf, it looked so unappealing, I gave it a try and it tasted just as bad as it looked I only had two bites and could barely eat those, they also put some awful gravy on top, for an upscale hotel and restaurant I'm extremely disappointed in the food, definitely would not eat there again",2019-08-10T10:03:41Z,106
1065,Shangri-La,4.3,"Second visit to this 5 star hotel. I chose it over the Fairmont Rim because they have a breakfast+parking rate that easily beats other hotels in the downtown core. 
Reception: Hot towels at the front desk and valet parking. 
1. Room: Basic King room is large! Sleeping and sitting areas are divided by a real door so that night owl partners don't bother the early sleepers. The bathroom has two sections for the  Upon arrival there is a welcome snack of fresh fruit, sparkling and flat water, and savory snacks along with a personalized note. Drapes and lights are controlled via button panels located around the rooms. Nespresso machine with tea and coffee and a full mini-bar below allow guests to relax en-suite. 

2. Bathroom: AMENITIES! Occitane en Provence lotions, shampoo, shower gel, etc. Dental kits, nail kit, shower cap, shaving kit! The shower has two modes: rainfall and handheld wand. Read the directions before turning the handles. I took full advantage of the large bathtub after my massage. So relaxing. 

3. Breakfast (included in our rate) astonished us. André from Montréal informed us that we could choose anything from the menu - meaning we could order multiple dishes. I tried the dumplings and the eggs benedicte. It was ""Thanksgiving"" after all! In true Canadienne fashion, I had a Caeser (also included in our meal) and it possibly one of the best I have had this month. Ha!

4. We did have happy hour in the lounge. Canadian pours of Whiskey are ""different"" than in WA State. Et de bonnes frites!

I am not wealthy, but coming to the Shangri-La provides me that cherished momentary feeling of luxury. I look forward to returning soon.",2017-11-29T01:53:44Z,106
1066,Shangri-La,4.3,"Plopped right in the heart of downtown Vancouver, and a nice healthy walk to Stanley Park and easy jaunt to Gastown, you can't beat the location. The hotel takes up the first 15 floors of the glittering tower with residences above. Which means the reception area and street level lobby are very quiet and free from the usually hustle and bustle. 

I had the entry level Superior room which was quite comfortable with a surprisingly large bathroom replete with soaking tub and spacious shower, with the commode separated by sliding frosted glass. 

Love the amenities from the umbrella readily hanging in the closet, the superb push button lighting system (lights automatically come on when you insert your keycard into the LED lit slot next to the door), toothbrush and paste, and L'Occitane products. 

While the honor bar is generously stocked and tempting there's a gourmet market right next door and a BC Liquors a few blocks away.  Could this location be any better? 

Topping it off with the usual exceptional Shangri-La service (even better here, after all you're in Canada!) makes for a relaxing and deliciously luxurious stay.",2016-12-29T22:33:19Z,106
1067,Shangri-La,4.3,"Please do not waste your money here. The hotel lacks of accommodating services, hospitalities and real amenities as a 5 star hotel. The pool is tiny, the gym is adequate at best and the service was honestly questionable comparing to Trump international. My father and I arrived at the hotel were treated poorly, given with the wrong keys and weren't able to enter our room. The lockers at the women's change room were broken as well, and I had to wait for their security to open it for me, while I was in a towel, with no formal apology for such inconvenience at all. I know my bias comes from the fact that I just experienced a fabulous, personable care and attentive service at the Trump International, but it goes to show that there are better options  in town. ;) 

Shangari la used to be my favorite (especially the one in Paris- the facilities were amazing), but Vancouver has truly and disappointedly, screwed it all up and we will no not return nor make any recommendations for them.",2017-03-07T09:07:05Z,106
1068,Shangri-La,4.3,"Unbelievable experience here for 3 nights. Excellent location with reasonable walking distances to all of the areas and landmarks in Vancouver. Bedroom, restaurant, and hospitality were certainly 5 stars or better. Highly recommend if you want the upscale experience.

1070,Shangri-La,4.3,"Hotels is great.  They have great service straight away from the time you walk in the front door.  

The lower level parking garage entrance is manned 24 hours a day which is very easy for the valet, etc.

They also had oranges on the table upon arrival.  

It's centrally located in the heart of Vancouver which is great for both business and fun nightlife.  

Don't go to the lounge in the lobby though, pretty lame.",2015-03-30T02:13:37Z,106
1071,Shangri-La,4.3,"Like the Four Seasons, the Shangri-La is polished, well appointed, comfortable and well-situated if you can bankroll Burberry, Hermes and other shops of that sort in the West End of Vancouver, B.C. It sits next to a gourmet grocery store next door called Urban Fare, and has one of the most incredible hotel gyms I have ever seen. 

Unfortunately, it comes nowhere close to the Four Seasons in terms of customer service. 

While their room service staff is great, with impeccable attention to detail, their front desk staff is poorly trained, easily befuddled and struggles with their extremely bureaucratic management structure.  

As long as you have zero expectations that your room will be available on time when you check in, and not three hours late, you'll be fine. 

Have other expectations? Go to the Four Seasons.",2010-01-09T18:58:24Z,106
1072,Shangri-La,4.3,"Smells wonderful, looks wonderful, feels wonderful - and on top of that, the impeccable, friendly, just right brand of service was just what we needed after a disappointing stay at another hotel. I now have an idea of the level of service at Shangri-La Hotels and wouldn't hesitate to book again, as a result - you've made a loyal customer out of me, Shangri-La! The actual experience here far exceeded its reputation.",2018-12-06T23:42:40Z,106
1073,Shangri-La,4.3,"Superb, understated opulence, fabulous staff & an awesome location. Can't wait to be back! 

The experience is quintessential Shangri-La: a beautiful, unfussy, simply decorated, quiet and welcoming retreat with gracious staff members always aiming to please. 

ATMOSPHERE: 
It's the perfect vibe for those looking for an understated, elegant, private getaway. If you're not into über-trendy, club-like hotels, or if you don't care for being in the center of a hustle-bustle, conspicuous, see & be seen hotel (such as the Fairmont Pacific Place), this is the hotel for you! No doubt celebs stay here, but you get the sense that the Shangri-La is all about discretion and focusing on nothing but an excellent guest experience. 

ROOM: 
The hallways are this gorgeous, dark floor-to-ceiling wood (zebrawood or rosewood?), and the rooms themselves have lovely floor-to-ceiling marble in the bathroom, amazingly comfortable beds, and high-class but simple appointments throughout. Got an upgrade to a room with a huge balcony, which was too cold to use in the Vancouver spring, but provided great city views onto Alberni street. 

SERVICE: 
Every staff member was A+, from Adrian (concierge) to Christine (housekeeping) to Jay (food & bev mgr). I'm just a regular Jane Doe, but they made me feel like a VIP all the way. 

FITNESS CENTER: 
Large, very pristine, well-equipped, huge windows for lots of natural light. Separate, open studio room is awesome, especially if you want more room to do yoga, weights, stretches or just meditate. Locker/lounge area includes sauna and steam rooms.",2011-05-01T22:36:44Z,106
1074,Shangri-La,4.3,"I attended a work event that was held at Shangri-La and it was beautifully catered.  

The event was held upstairs and covered a great deal of space.  We had a huge reception area with coat check and bar, 2 ballrooms and a balcony area with a bar.  Within one of the ballrooms, they had a chef, -action station cooking Asian theme food.  There were mini Peking Duck wraps, dim sum items (har gow and sui mai), noodles and some other items I didn't get a chance to try.

The staff were organized, professional and friendly.  Glasses and garbage were picked up quickly and never left out too long.  

At the end of the evening, everyone I spoke with agreed that this was a classy event.  We'll definitely look to Shangri-La for another event in the future.",2012-06-11T15:26:33Z,106

1076,Shangri-La,4.3,"If it's good enough for the Dalai Lama, then it's good enough for me!

We stayed here a couple of weekends ago while in town for a wedding. It was very pleasant and in a prime location close to the water, shopping, museums, coffee shops/grocery, and restaurants. His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, was checking in just as we were leaving so there was a bit of hoopla but, hey, at least it was not Lindsay Lohan.

The hotel has an extremely Asian flair... and it's pretty authentic, from the ethnicities of their employees, to the decor, to the unique style of guest treatment.

- Bottled water from the valet while you wait
- Upon check-in, the receptionist/hostess will accompany you to the elevator to give you a full tutorial of the key card system
- Fresh fruit in the room
- Immaculate, quiet, and very posh with design in the details
- Luscious beds with matching linens
- Retractable shades at the push of a button in the room and bathroom
- A television embedded in the bathroom vanity mirror
- L'Occitane bath products including soap, body wash, shampoo/conditioner
- Toothbrush/tooth paste kits, sewing kit, cotton buds, comb, and more",2009-10-08T01:51:28Z,106
1077,Shangri-La,4.3,"Heavenly weekend at the Shangri-la.

The highlight of my weekend in Vancouver was our stay at the Shangri-La.  The hotel itself was exceptional -- beautiful and modern.  Unique amenities.  Comfy beds.  I could go on and on.

What made this hotel stand out from others was the exceptional service of everyone we encountered at the hotel.  From the front desk check-in, to the housekeeping staff, the servers in the restaurant and the spa staff.  There was a consistency in premium level service, combined with an inviting warmth, that is rare these days.

What's more!  The hotel itself is conveniently located close to Robson street or the waterfront.

Without a doubt I will return.  I highly recommend this incredible hotel.",2015-03-22T05:54:18Z,106
1078,Shangri-La,4.3,"Had the pleasure of attending a friend's wedding here.  The set up was beautiful and was large enough to accommodate 100+ people.  The staff were extremely friendly and spoke several different languages.  It was an international wedding with people flying in from different countries and all over the U.S. so it was really helpful to have bilingual staff on board. 

Room service is amazing; a bit expensive but that's to be expected.  The rooms are large, the decor was amazing--- especially the bathrooms.  Gheeze.  Our view was great and had a balcony where tables and chairs were set.  The room comes equipped with everything you'd normally see: storage, mini bar, small fridge, coffee machine (I want to say it was a keurig), wifi, etc.

Overall, the experience is great. And they offer corporate discounts!  Check them out!",2015-03-11T21:47:15Z,106

Upon check-in they remembered us and that it was my wife's birthday even though we had not been here in years. We were offered opportunity to upgrade to a suite and add breakfast which was a great deal. The one bedroom suite was comfortable and nicely furnished and breakfast fantastic (though I wish the hollandaise on the eggs Benedict was a bit warmer. 

Pool area and jacuzzi spa were amazing as usual. We were in it as snow fell and served a delightful fruit infused water. The bar was great for cocktails in the evening - one of the best Hemingway daiquiris I've had. Highly recommend this place.",2016-12-09T19:34:41Z,106
1081,Shangri-La,4.3,"When its too good to be true, it typically is.  They have a promotion until end of September.  It is my wife's birthday and will also celebrate our anniversary. Photos look great.  Promotion is $299 with fee parking, $50 credit for dinner and breakfast.  Would even upgrade a room.  So I called.  The rep started by inviting me to take advantage of either $900 or $1500 per night.  When I talked about the $299 promotion not only did she put me on hold for more than 20 minutes, she came back and said that promotion was no longer available.  If they are inviting you to take advantage of $900 or $1500 per night, it means that they do have rooms.  Don't get me wrong, if I could afford it, I would pull the trigger. My wife deserves it after putting up with me for more than 33 years.  What a shame they will not honor what they have promoted.  Time to look for another hotel.",2019-08-05T03:09:16Z,106
1082,Shangri-La,4.3,"In regards of the hotel service, I finally got a chance to speak to the front desk for an extraordinary event. And I would rate the front desk of Shangri-La are well trained, polite and friendly over the phone. It was a pleasant to address my concern over the phone and they apologized with great attitude. (although not their fault at all!!) 

This review is address to future guests staying this hotel. If something happens with the internal line (ie house keeping service), please go to front desk directly instead of calling the #3340 several times (10 min gap). It was very frustrated and harassed when you suddenly receiving phone calls asking for house keeping services. 

My co-worker unfortunately received several calls during a day and have no idea what's going wrong. During our busy season at work, it has been bothering me - her roommate at work all morning and can't concentrate to work. 

So I decided to deal with it for her, picked up the phone call and pretended I am the front desk and would like to take message for the guests. But what kind of guest refused to leave your room number and issue to front desk if you want to be helped! or speak to the house keeping line. So after several non stop calling from hotel room to my co-worker's cell phone. This guest finally told me which hotel she's call from and her room number. It took over 2 hours to settle this issue and i made a call to the hotel front desk. 

Although this has never happened to me, but it might happen to anyone in any hotel in the world. I am not sure hot this happened - hotel guest calling internal line but connected to unknown numbers. If it ever happens to you, please be smart and think before you called the same line over 10 times in 2 hours without been helped.",2015-04-20T15:02:03Z,106
1083,Shangri-La,4.3,"Our visit to the Shangri-la Vancouver was short and sweet. We flew in the day prior to our Alaskan cruise to get a little feel of Vancouver. My husband and I have never been and had we known we would have so much fun we would have certainly flown in a night or two earlier! One day was nearly not enough. 

We booked our hotel accommodations almost a year in advance through our American Express Fine Resorts and Hotels program. We got our upgraded room and out of many 5 star hotels we've stayed at we were super impressed. Although not the largest room, it definitely made up for it by having every imaginable amenity/technology anyone would appreciate for a downtown city hotel.

The bathroom is drop dead gorgeous! Marble everywhere...Huge bathtub, automatic shades that roll down with a push of a button. A BALCONY-in the bathroom-wow!!! Automatic draperies that open and close in front of another balcony in the room. The lighting in the room is beyond any other hotel we've ever stayed at. It has dimming and also preset lighting functions for TV viewing as well as a nightlight function that under-lights a soft glow from underneath the bathroom vanity and the nightstand. A big TV, an amazing nespresso cappuccino machine and even a hot water kettle with an assortment of teas. The bar is also well stocked and neatly displayed in a drawer. Did I mention the l'occitane bathroom toiletries? The luxe bathrobes? The toothbrushes? The turndown service complete with floor towel and slippers and bottled water? The laundry bags are even nice. The 3 small plums that appear in the room on a small piece of slate with your welcome letter is also a very nice touch. They really put a lot of thought into adding special touches for the guests that stay here. Bravo designers!!!

All the service we encountered was very pleasant during our stay as expected at a 5 star hotel. One standout I'd like to mention was Jarren at the concierge. He really went above and beyond helping us with our restaurant reservation as well as directions and things to do during our short stay. He was extremely knowledgeable about the area and we had an excellent meal! He is great!

We also had breakfast included in our stay at Jean George's Market and it was delicious. Loved the chic decor and great  eggs benedict! The pastries were fantastic as well. 

Next time we will stay longer and look forward to staying at another Shangri-la property.",2015-08-06T02:38:01Z,106
1084,Shangri-La,4.3,"If you're looking for a hotel to celebrate that special occasion, or a stay where you know you'll be taken care of every minute during your stay - this is the place. This was our first visit to Vancouver and it happened to be the weekend of our wedding anniversary. 

The service was just absolutely impeccable. From the moment we arrived to the very minute we stepped foot in our taxi to head to the airport - nothing feel short of amazing! The staff is warm, friendly and always has a smile. Everyone is willing to help make your stay more comfortable and pleasant. I was emailing back and forth with the hotel concierge leading up to our trip to ensure I plan the most of our stay and be sure to check out the proper spots in town. I was so glad I did, because we would have missed some great bars in Gastown and small shops to keep an eye out for in Granville Island. 

The bar is sexy, modern and has a great vibe to it - the Xi Shi lounge was such a fabulous touch to the hotel.  During high tea, you'll enjoy live piano and a wide array of tea to choose from. The dessert, pastries and sandwiches were divine! I sincerely appreciated them accommodating my veggie hubby. We came in the evening to have one last cocktail before a nightcap - they had a live DJ with a good amount of patrons inside boozing the night up. 

Breakfast was by far the best meal I've ever had at a hotel restaurant. We had fresh juice, tea, coffee, smoothie of the day, fresh fruit, fresh baked pastries...and that's all to start. My staple item for our stay was the scrambled eggs with bacon - yum!!! If you can't manage to fill your belly with all the yummy food - be sure to ask the restaurant to pack your uneaten pastries to go. It makes for a wonderful afternoon snack when venturing throughout the city! 

The pool and hot tub were amazing. After a day spent in Whistler - this was the perfect way to relax while enjoying the cityscape around you. If you have time to visit the juice bar, be sure to chck out a wide array of their fresh juices, made to order. Who doesn't love that kind of service?!

Overall, I can't speak highly enough about this hotel, From arrival, to housekeeping, to the bar, to the restaurant to the concierge - this was definitely one of the top hotel stays I've experienced and I can't thank you all enough for making our weekend all the more special!",2015-04-07T22:36:16Z,106

1087,Shangri-La,4.3,"The first half of my latest stay was pretty flawless.  Concierge services and guest services were notably much higher quality than before. There was still a bit of noise heard in the room, this time coming from a loud security alarm of a neighboring business going off several times in the night and the early morning. The property did a good job identifying the source after I reported it in the morning, so hopefully that is fixable. The large white construction tarp hanging from the glass wall at the pool also took away a bit of the ambiance, and should be taken away as soon as possible. One of the ladies working at the pool could have also been a little better at communications and customer relations, or just a little friendlier observing her and other guests. Still not a fan of the restaurant, and wish there would have been a little bit more water in the room, but almost everything else was greatly improved from previous visits. It is definitely getting better there, and I would surely return to see what the next visits can be. Getting closer to the full 5 stars again.",2019-12-24T10:34:29Z,106
1088,Shangri-La,4.3,"I surprised my wife with a staycation at the Shangri-la for some much needed R&R.  One of the reasons I chose the Shangri-la is because according to their website, all rooms have a deep soaker tub. This is perfect since she loves a nice hot bath to decompress. After finding the check-in area (it's on the lower level for some reason), it was smooth and easy. When we got up to our assigned room on the 7th floor, there was no deep soaker tub (or tub for that matter) to be found at all. My wife insisted it wasn't a big deal but I did a double check on the website which did state that the rooms have the tub. We went back down to reception and I plead my case. Monette, the lady at the front desk helped us out. Long story short, we were assigned three different rooms and had to come back down to the front desk three different times to get things straightened out. Monette was apologetic and was eager to make things right. In the end, we were upgraded to an executive king room with a balcony. She came up to the room with us to ensure that there would be no more issues. Most importantly, (for this stay anyway) the room had a very nice soaker tub that my wife could relax in.

Overall, the room was very clean and nicely appointed. The furniture is not as modern as probably some of the newer hotels, ie Trump or Pacific Rim... but adequate. The bed is probably due for a replacement soon. It was comfortable but a bit soft to the point where I was sleeping in the indentation where many have slept before. I think where Shangri-la stands out are their oversized bathrooms. In each of the three rooms we were in, the bathrooms were a great size which gives it a definite upscale feel along with the L'Occitane soaps and shampoos. We went to check out the pool facility but never used it as we were only there for one night. We thought about using it but when I looked down from our balcony in the evening, the hot tub was pretty busy.

Upon checkout, Monette left us a parting gift for all our troubles, a box of macarons. Very thoughtful and at that point she definitely went above and beyond. It was unexpected but a nice touch. Although there was a mixup at first, the service is definitely what you would expect for a 5 star hotel.",2017-02-27T21:42:31Z,106
1089,Shangri-La,4.3,"I've stayed here a couple of nights and had my wedding here, and this place is top notch.

I'll start with the stay here since that's more common. From the valet to the concierge to the porter to the restaurant staff, I've never encountered such great and pleasant manner and service. They refuse to drop the titles and are ever striving to solve any issues I bring up. When I realized I forgot my printed vows for my wedding at 1 in the morning the night before, they were quick to not just print off a copy for me, but ask if I wanted color or black/white, how many copies. They even delivered it in a nice manila envelope after emailing me that they received my file and that it was successfully printed. 

The one-bedroom suite had a lovely foyer area, complete with some lovely chocolate-covered strawberries, treats, and a congratulatory sign letting us know we have access to a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine. We had access to a lovely balcony overlooking a busy street, a lush bathroom with a pair of soft robes and slippers, a couple of complimentary water bottles & jellies daily, and Keurig-like machine with some coffee inserts. Beautifully decorated. 

Now for the wedding-- Stephanie was a huuuuge help in guiding me through the planning process. We didn't start hitting the real details until maybe a few weeks out from the wedding, but she was always responsive to emails within a few days (since she's the event coordinator, I realized she likely had dozens of important emails hit her daily). She was always very friendly and helpful in trying to figure out what the best plan or tactic would be to solve a problem. Based on her experience, she would also offer her input on what would be feasible or what would have the best outcome. Most wedding food is known for being blah at best, but I had nearly every guest come up to me and tell me how spectacular the meals were. Everything we ordered from their menu was absolutely delectable. Not a single grumbling was heard about the food nor the service. The staff were kind enough to even set aside a couple of plates for my husband and myself since they knew we wouldn't be able to eat the hors d'oeuvres during cocktail hour. Small gesture, but great meaning. Absolutely nothing I would change about my interaction with the hotel. Fair warning though to people looking into weddings here-- it's best for smaller weddings (less than 70 guests) and you can't BYOB to be served, meaning that each bottle is costly. But hey, what do you expect from a 5 star hotel, right?

I've stayed at a different Shangri-La Hotel, but this tops even among its own brand.",2017-12-10T15:08:52Z,106
1090,Shangri-La,4.3,"Always a pleasure to stay at a shangri-la property and the Vancouver location doesn't disappoint.  Great rooms, great staff and the best location make this one of my favourite hotels in the city.",2018-03-17T18:29:05Z,106
1091,Shangri-La,4.3,"Not a horrible stay But I just wasn't impressed.... 
1. Our room was lovely though and I liked the automatic buttons for the drapes, and loved the tv in the mirror of the vanity in the bathroom. And liked the free wi fi 
2. But there was no turn down service the second night of our stay 
3. Before checking in we had requested a king size bed and then at arrival they wanted to put us in a queen. It was a conversation with management and a little drama that got our room switched 
4. The lobby isn't impressive so if just feels like a glorified Marriott 


The staff was nice though so that met the standards, I just didn't feel like we were in a 4-5 star hotel.",2016-10-23T06:24:57Z,106
1092,Shangri-La,4.3,"This is one of those times that I wish Yelp let you do half stars, since it really deserves 4.5 stars, but it doesn't quite qualify for 5.  But oh so close. 

Overall, it is a very luxurious hotel with many, many nice touches.  Everything in the room is controlled by electronic switches, including the drapes and sheer curtains.  They have pre-programmed ambient lighting, and when you come into your room, all you have to do is slide your key card into the holder and all the lights come on.  

Extra nice touches include the huge bathroom with a mirror that has a TV built into it, a shower and a tub.  The bed is very comfortable.  Rooms are all set up differently, based on conversations with co-workers.  Some have massive windows in their bathrooms, while I have none.  Someone actually has a balcony off their bathroom.  

However, there are little odd quirks that make you scratch your head.  For example, the TV is a large, beautiful Sony LCD HDTV but only half the channels are in HD.  However, more importantly, in my room, the TV is right near the thermostat, which means when you have the TV on, it keeps setting off the A/C as the heat radiates from the back.  The TV is also painfully slow when trying to navigate any menus. 

You need to use your key card to press any buttons in the elevator, but it doesn't automatically send you to your floor - you need to wave it, then press your button.  I know that sounds whiny, but it makes you ask yourself  ""If all the lights in my room are electronically controlled and fade on and off, and everything is controlled via RFID with my room's key card, then why didn't they go the extra mile (inch) and make the elevator automatically go to my floor?""  That question is compounded by the fact that the only buttons you can press are the lobby, restaurant, spa/gym and your room floor.  If you want to go see someone on a different floor, you have to meet somewhere and then go together.  Odd. 

Other weird little lapses in thinking things through include the fact that there is this fabulous button next to your bed that will turn off all the lights in the room when you are ready for bed, and gently fade them while doing it.  Unless you left a light on in the bathroom that is, then you have to do that separately.  Again, this is such a small thing that I feel like a jerk even mentioning it, but the fact that they clearly paid so much attention to everything else but stopped just short of total integration and perfection is interesting. 

Don't get me wrong - this is a super luxurious hotel with fantastic service.  The staff is great and the rooms are fabulous.  As a business traveler, I appreciated the fact that the wi-fi is free and was flawless to log into.  

I would recommend to anyone to stay here with absolutely no qualms, but if you pay close attention, I think you will find the same little quirks that we all did that make you go ""wow.. so close to perfection"" but not quite there.  So really.. 4.75 stars out of five might be the most appropriate.",2011-04-01T01:18:53Z,106
1093,Shangri-La,4.3,Just checked in tonight for my honeymoon. I've never had better service in a Shangri-La. They gave us excellent restaurant reviews and then proceeded to walk us up to the room to give us a tour. I'm writing this as we enjoy our complimentary chocolate strawberries and champagne- very classy! Looking forward to our massage and workout tomorrow.,2015-09-08T06:14:47Z,106
1094,Shangri-La,4.3,"All based on location, decor, convenience, esp. for the public washrooms--this is by far one of my fav destinations for an emergency #2 when you're in DT  & need some extra time, as opposed to going to a restaurant.

If you can enter in from Alberni side, & enter thru the 'side' glass doors, no one will notice you.  Individual washrooms, the size  so spacious that you can bring in a mountain bike no problem.

thick, ""paper-cloth"" napkins. Even the cloth towels avail too for cleaning face.  Soap & lotion also offered.

Lobby-wise, quite comfortable seating, & a few art pieces too.

Actually, a 2nd lobby exists too if you're driving, the entrance is near the church, & underground.",2013-01-03T02:38:59Z,106
1095,Shangri-La,4.3,"Luxury is the only word needed to describe this place. We stayed in a suite for our wedding night, and we were greeted with a beautifully furnished room, top notch bathroom, and chocolate dipped strawberries! 

I always regard the bathroom as the true measurement of the calibre of a hotel, and Shangri-La delivered beautifully: granite counter top, heated floor, toilet separated by frosted glass, separate shower and deep soaker bath that's big enough for 2! ;) Their exclusive bath collection from L'Occitane is divine. It's the perfect balance of smooth vanilla, refreshing bergamot, and elegant jasmine. It was so good I had to ask the front desk if I can buy this collection! 

Being the night of our wedding, we were surely to be plagued by headaches and muscle sores, so we decided to get room service for breakfast. We went with the dimsum sampler because we wanted something comforting. It was expensive, but it was also awesome. Not in the sense it's the best dimsum I've had in the city, but it just hit the spot in terms of taste and portion. My husband and I were both very satisfied.",2015-07-10T00:15:42Z,106
1096,Shangri-La,4.3,"We recently stayed here. It was just ok. I expected better. 

Pros
-Fantastic bathroom! was large, heated floors. 
-Good size tub and walk in shower. 
-room with a large balcony, great.
-Comfy King size bed.
-excellent downtown location.

Cons
-The room was showing signs of wear and tear. Scratches on the table and furniture.
-TV in the bathroom did not work as they are having cable issues with Shaw. 
-The staff were pleasant but many are clearly inexperienced in the subtleties true 5 star customer service. I grew weary of the rehearsed overused lines no doubt straight from the employee training manual.  
-Shameless ""up selling"" of massage and spa services... ""I understand you would like to enjoy a massage"" (thinking .. would you like fries with that burger) ""No thank you"" I say, ""not interested "" oh ...you are transferring me to the spa to set up an appointment. Great. 
-we had to wait a few moments for the room as they were preparing it for a small special request that we had made, no problem. But, when we got to the room, the request was not there.
-This may not be an issue with others, but I found the small basement lobby disappointing. For me a true grand Hotel has a majestic entrance & lobby, a sense of excitement, people coming and going. The wee entrance off street level reminded me of a condo. 

Ok, so many more cons (yeah mostly minor) than pros here. But, they add up to the, or should I say detract from the overall experience. Thus the 3 stars. Place was a miss for me, not a true five star luxury hotel. Will definitely try the Fairmont Pacific Rim or Four Seasons next time.",2016-03-09T23:21:46Z,106
1097,Shangri-La,4.3,"Wow, I can't say enough good things about this hotel!! We had the best time in Vancouver and a lot of it had to do with our enjoyable experience at this hotel. Everything was top notch from the room, the service, amenities,and helpful concierge. I was so impressed and this hotel  went above my expectations for a 5 star hotel. We had a one bedroom suite and the room was super modern with electric controls for the sheers and drapes and a nice control for the lighting in the room. The suite was decorated nice and was not cluttered. The balcony was huge and had a great view of downtown Vancouver. My favorite part of our particular suite was the huge bathroom shower head with 3 settings you could choose from. The bed was super comfortable. I would look forward to chilling in our room and coming back to our room after a day out. I was having difficulty trying to get reservations at one busy restaurant in downtown and Jarren at concierge was able to arrange our reservation at the restaurant for us. He went above and beyond to make our visit more enjoyable! He was so nice and helpful and we really appreciated it! 

The high tea in Shangri-La's Xi Shi lounge was the best high tea experience we ever had. We had a nice variety of sandwiches, (smoked salmon, cucumber, Cornish-hen sandwiches), and their scones with clotted cream and jam were delicious. I also recommend trying breakfast in the hotel's restaurant Market by Jean-Georges, they give complimentary smoothies, and made special chocolate chip pancakes for me since that's what I wanted but it wasn't on the menu. 

There's no Shangri-La hotel in America; this was my first time in a Shangri-La hotel but if we go to China and the other countries that have this awesome hotel, we'll be sure to stay here!  If you're ever in Vancouver, I highly recommend staying at this hotel, you will not be disappointed!!",2015-06-08T20:15:25Z,106
1098,Shangri-La,4.3,"Mmmmm......interesting hotel with many quirks.
We are traveling the west coast, staying at 5* hotels throughout, the Shangri-La was the most expensive around $600 per night, and unfortunately scored the lowest overall.

Pros: super attentive, discreet staff, you get the impression nothing would be too much to ask for.
Beautiful corridors, bathrooms (large and luxurious), balconies and hotel lounge.
Comfortable beds, tasteful decor and fab light switches with dimmers.
Nice hand written note, apricots and cookies awaiting us in our room.

Cons: bizarre entrances; from the below ground car park/ check-in to the downright weird street level (no signage or markings) concierge? You are shunted downstairs to a tiny desk which felt like an airport car drop off. As a first impression, this sucked.
Our corner suite room was also a bizarre layout, with a huge dark wood inner paneled hall, leading to a very small lounge/work area. The hall is larger than the living area and a complete waste of space. The large desk also obscures the best view of the suite. If this is feng shui it doesn't work-it's rather baffling.

The location is so-so neither good nor bad.... not close to the waterfront with no views and a couple of blocks to the downtown main area. There were also a few entitled, young Asian princesses hanging at the (v small) pool. Their mother apparently owned an apartment there and they thought nothing of talking smack about girls they knew, fat models!?! and cussing in front of children. Not the hotels fault, for sure - but maybe an indication of the clientelle.",2014-06-23T04:58:22Z,106
1099,Shangri-La,4.3,"Wow, what an AMAZING experience I had here at the Shangri-La. My boyfriend surprised me by getting us an executive suite here for our 1 year anniversary. As soon as we pulled into the valet, the attendant was already aware it was our anniversary and congratulated us. Such a surprise! Got inside, and everyone at the front desk knew it was our anniversary as well. I immediately felt so welcomed and so special, it was a great start to my night.

The room was wonderful! So spacious, amazing view, and THEE most comfortable bed/pillows I have ever slept on my entire life. Not kidding. The only odd thing was that the shower temperature kept getting really hot then really cold, so we kinda had to power through the shower and couldn't fully enjoy it. Still, even that wasn't enough of an issue to spoil the experience.

The location is perfect. After a wonderful night, we were only a walk away from coffee and food. Very important! I would love to stay here again. :)",2014-08-19T19:28:00Z,106
1100,Shangri-La,4.3,"High tea at the Shangri-La.

Usually at $30 per person, during the tourism challenge with the passport was half off.  It was the perfect opportunity to sample and indulge with close girlfriends.  Open between 2:30 -4:30 pm, this place is perfect for an afternoon snack.  Both the menu and the tea is Asian inspired.  The sandwiches and scones were buttery and delicious.  The desserts were ok, but I give them full points on originality.  It included a red bean and black sesame flavors.  

If you stay past 4:30, they put out complimentary snacks by the bar area and you can sit and enjoy the pianist.",2010-07-19T20:42:26Z,106
1101,Shangri-La,4.3,"When it comes to overall experience - it's in line with the best we've had.

Booked through tablethotels.com the same morning we decided to go up to Vancouver and got a really good package including free breakfast at their restaurant and free valet parking.

Hotel is very nice.  Pretty decorations.  Entrance into the hotel is a little tricky since you go underground, just keep your eyes open.  Very high end with excellent service.

1 bedroom suite was decent size with little living room.  Rooms are laid out a little  wanky but kind of neat and different for a change.  Bathrooms are big and nice amenities.  

Front desk was so so.  Concierge was awesome and got us a reservation right away after we called the restaurant directly and they said they weren't taking reservations anymore.  

Bar on main lobby was meh - guess it turns into a ""night club"" at 9 pm even though it's decently small.  Recommend going to 5th floor instead where the restaurant is, looks a lot nicer there.

Overall great stay in Vancouver with great service.  Housekeepers were very nice elderly ladies - friendly and good vibes.",2015-03-10T01:27:07Z,106
1102,Shangri-La,4.3,"WOW. What a beautiful hotel with impeccable service.  Came here for valentines weekend and was blown away from the moment we saw the hotel in the distance.  The parking garage entry and valet is wonderful.  The asian inspired decor is beautifully modern and elegant.  We were greeted by the wonderful staff who were eager, friendly, and so helpful.  We were delighted to valet our car and check our luggage before our room was ready so we could explore the city.  One we came back to the hotel we were excited to find out we had been upgraded from our executive balcony suite to a one bedroom suite.  The rooms are phenomenal, large and comfortable with automatic drapes and sheers.  The room has two large televisions and comfortable furniture.  The lights are all operated on a single control panel where you can dim and turn them on and off.  The bed was extremely comfortable and we slept like babies.  In our opinion the bathroom is where the room really shines, marble tub, shower, floors, and toilet room.  They're so luxurious and comfortable with beautiful accoutrements from a high end bath boutique on Robson Street.  We were blown away by the little things, complimentary robes, razor and shaving cream, valentines chocolates in our rooms, and the television hidden and integrated in the mirror!

The amenities at this hotel are also top notch.  The spa and pool looked wonderful and the lounge with live piano music was also nice.  The street level lobby is gorgeous, floor to ceiling glass with huge chandeliers and soaring ceilings.  The staff was so friendly and helpful, giving us ideas on what to visit, where to go, and were to avoid at late hours.  The location can not be beat either, we were a block away from Robson street with never ending nightlife and great restaurants, and of course on West Georgia are all the high end stores, Gucci, Hermes, Louis Vuitton, etc.  You're also incredibly close to the seawall and the Olympic Caldren, a great nighttime visit.

Overall, 5 out if 5 stars, a must stay hotel!!!!",2015-02-23T05:04:07Z,106
1103,Shangri-La,4.3,"One of the biggest perks to my job is that when I travel, they don't put me up in cockroach infested hotels. And of all the nice hotels I've been put up in, this may be the nicest. Literally. If you've seen one marble bathroom, you've kind of seen them all. But what sets the Shangri-La apart is the service. When you check in, they bring a bowl of fruit to your room. The wi-fi is free, not an insane amount a day like most places of this ilk. And seemingly every week, I come back to my room to find some sort of goody. For Canadian Thanksgiving, they brought up Pumpkin Pie tarts to everyone. 

I'd gladly stay longer, if only my company would pick up the tab.",2012-10-08T02:30:46Z,106
1104,Shangri-La,4.3,"Yay! I'm a fan of the hotel! ---The venue needs work on.

I came here for a New Year's Eve event that the hotel threw.  It was my very first time in the hotel.  The event itself needs a little bit more work on it but the hotel itself is gorgeous! The party was held on the 6th floor and they turned a few rooms into different themed music rooms.  so the people that like trance, stayed in one room and the others that like top 40 mix stayed in another room and danced the night away.

The hotel served appetizers through out the night.  I can't remember any of it since it was such a long time ago.  The appies were delicious, the drinks were extremely over priced (but you get that at any new years eve event) and the crowd was very multicultural.  

The hotel staff were very nice at directing us as to where to go and they were very prompt at getting the dance floor cleaned up.  I think there were a few occasions that I saw them bring out the vacuum.  

Anyways, the venue itself needed work!  I wish there was a separate rating for events.  there probably is.  I need to search.  OH yeah, hardly any party favors, no complimentary champagne at midnight, no live clock.  the DJ kept on switching the screen back and forth from what he was playing and the clock.  

I hope this doesn't divert any of you from not going to the Shangri-La.",2011-01-20T05:31:11Z,106
1105,Shangri-La,4.3,Such a nice hotel the only thing id have to point out is there parking seems kinda inconvenient to the guests they have a unlimited valet option and a daily option except the daily is not in and out parking its pay every time you leave and come back if you get lucky and the same spot is open then you dont have to pay again but in the case someone parks there youre out of luck you have to pay again for a different spot other than that great hotel highly recommend if you do not have a vehicle.,2019-05-19T22:50:46Z,106
1106,Shangri-La,4.3,Beautiful hotel with immaculate staff and enchanting lands. Stayed here for a couple nights. I really enjoyed the quiet rooms and the room Service. Everything is brand new and fresh I will stay here for sure next time I come on town.,2017-02-18T20:30:50Z,106
1107,Shangri-La,4.3,"We stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel for a three day get-away from San Diego and our first time in Vancouver. Like other Yelp Reviewer Derek, it was good but not perfect. We travel extensively to Europe and Latin American and so we were excited to visit Canada. In sum, beautiful concept but not so great delivery (for what you pay). 

Overall, the vibe of the hotel is calm and soothing. The bathroom is amazing (shower, hologram tv in mirror, marble, etc.). The lounge seemed pretty cool but we only stop in to see what was going on and opted to explore the rest of the city in our limited time. 

We did a couples massage which we both loved. Good massage therapists and very professional. We especially enjoyed the ginger tea they served us afterwards and bought some to take home at the T&T market in Chinatown by the Stadium subway station. Very expensive but worth it!

Having a balcony was great. There was construction going on across the street but we were high enough not to hear anything too bothersome and could just relax on the chairs/table. 

Great breakfast with amazing staff and delicious food. 

Apparently, according to some locals we met in Vancouver, this hotel has ""stars"" that stay here, so that was exciting to know. 

Concierge was terrific in getting us dinner reservations and helping orient us. However, they did not know about some of the restaurants we had researched as being really good in the general downtown area. We wanted to know about hearing live music and they were pretty shaky on that too. They were QUITE young and there was a new one every night but each of them did a good job.

The downsides....
-- Our room was okay but odd shape, sort of lumpy bed, and limited TV. Since this was our first trip without traveling with our two toddlers, we were hoping to lounge in our room a bit more but it was not that enticing. 

-- We are two educators and were happy to splurge on an expensive room but the overall experience of staying at an ultra fancy hotel got a bit costly!! 

-- The check out process was odd. I like that there was just a tiny desk in the bottom / garage level BUT our check in person did not tell us anything about room or the package we bought. So, the customer service part of this process was not that great. 

-- Treatment. I think I should not have read so many of the Yelp reviews that went into detail of how special they were made to feel because we basically felt that we were just there and no one really cared! Not that we need or want special treatment but if this is something the hotel offers, unfortunately we did not receive it. 

Overall, we were happy to be away and to be in a central location. My husband was very happy (except for the bed) and love that balcony. I am not sure, however, given the costs, that is the best fit for us when we return to Vancouver.",2012-07-12T20:36:55Z,106
1108,Shangri-La,4.3,"I enjoyed afternoon tea at the Lobby Lounge with a friend recently. We waited for twenty minutes since we didn't have a reservation but our chatter and exploring the lobby and upstairs urban garden filled our time. 

We were contacted by the lovely and gracious hostess when it was ready for us and walked into the lounge to hear some classy piano music. The lounge is spacious and has tall ceilings. The seats are large, great for staying a while. 

Service was impeccable and the tea settings are exquisite. I couldn't take my eyes off the porcelain design. I tried the Roiboos tea and my friend had the Chai tea. I thought the teas were excellent quality, had good flavour and came with all the accoutrements.

When we were served the tiered tray with the little sandwiches and patisserie, our hostess took the time to describe the offerings. I thought the sandwiches were presented well but didn't taste as fresh but the sweets were executed well and it was more than enough for two people. The couscous in a shooter glass could use some more spice. We both enjoyed the berry parfait and the chocolate orange dessert the most. I also recommend the scones with Devonshire cream, fruit jam and homemade mango chutney!",2011-04-14T02:22:07Z,106
1109,Shangri-La,4.3,What a fine experience at this beautiful hotel. The service was impeccable and the rooms were comfortable and warmly decorated. A wonderful stay and an even better sleep on their extremely comfortable beds. The price was great too for such a lovely property.,2017-02-28T06:06:28Z,106
1110,Shangri-La,4.3,"This was the one night in Van where we laid our weary heads on the way up to Whistler the next morning :) What a great experience...the room was impeccably clean, large, modern and had above avg city views... the bed & bath were immaculately clean and pretty great to sleep on... the bathroom was larger in size than most NYC apartments...the hotel was quiet, staff was excellent and extremely nice... breakfast and waitstaff top-notch... it is a respite from the busy downtown streets during the day... such great proximity to so much downtown... cannot comment on amenities like pool / spa since I did not use them...I would totally return based on this first stay...

Realizing that I may have been there on an unusual day, I have to laugh that (similar to the Mandarin Oriental in Boston) the staff wear Asian attire...but, none of them were Asian....in a city like Vancouver... I just had to tell you, so they make a point to improve on that point if it is actually the case :) I may be wrong...",2012-03-11T00:14:31Z,106

It's very modern with that Asian vibe, decor and design.
It's very high end with automatic curtains, TV in bathroom mirror etc.
But it felt a little too dark to be a warm hotel room. Don't get me wrong, this place is amazing.
Room service food was the best I've ever had but the character/ambiance of the room put me off a bit.

It's also just a part owner/lessee of the building - makes not difference but though I would add that for completeness!",2011-09-29T22:52:52Z,106
1114,Shangri-La,4.3,"We had a lovely stay at the Shangri-La.  Due to a few oddities, this is more of a 4.5 star rating, but I had to round up due to all the good qualities and the excellent service.

Our arrival was quite nice.  Because we arrived so early (around 10am), our room was not ready, but we were able to handle all the registration at our arrival, and they took our luggage.  We were able to head out on the town without concern.  While the person checking us in did take my phone number and offered to text us when our room was ready, I never received the text.  That was no big deal, though, as we stayed out until after supper.  When we came back to reception, they were expecting us and had our keys ready to go.  No waiting at all, and our luggage already had been delivered to our room.

The reception area is one of the oddities, though.  It's tiny and underground.  I felt like I was coming in through the back door.  The passage from the front desk to the elevators was fairly tight.  I understand the need for space in the area, but I felt like I was coming in through the back door.  It wasn't terrible, but it hardly evokes luxury.

The street level lobby was not much better--just a door, some couches and chairs, and the concierge desk.  The lounge used to be there, but that appears to be turning into a Rolex store.  The only bar/lounge now is attached to the restaurant on 3.

Service was wonderful throughout our stay.  Everyone could not be nice enough.  We we entered our room for the first time at night, it occurred to us that we forgot to ask feather free bedding.  We called down, expecting quite a delay before anyone could do anything.  That delay turned out to just a little longer than it takes to make a cup of tea and figure out the television.  Minutes later, all the bedding was changed, down to the sheets, and the housekeepers could not have been nicer.

The room was very comfortable.  The couch was long enough to stretch out a little bit.  The bathroom was easy to get around in, and the lighting was excellent (lighting seems to be an issue in hotel bathrooms, these days).

Here's another oddity about the room, though--the light switches.  They take a little figuring out, which is neither so bad nor uncommon.  However, you must have a room key in the slot to turn them on.  Again, that's neither uncommon nor difficult, but this is supposed to be five star.  The very oddest bit, though, is that you have to remove your key and replace it if you use the ""night master"" button that turns off all lighting from your bedside.  You have to remove and replace the key even to use the coffee maker, and that makes for a some keystone cops style running around in the morning if someone is still in bed while someone else is up and looking to make some coffee because removing and replacing the room key in the slot also turns on all the lights in the room.  That's just a pain that should not exist in a five star hotel.

 Our only meal at Market was breakfast, and that was phenomenal.  We also unwound with a drink in the bar, one evening, and that also was very nice.

The location is hard to beat.",2016-08-07T17:18:26Z,106
1115,Shangri-La,4.3,"We couldn't have had a better experience at a hotel than the one we had at The Shangri-La Hotel in VC. 

The beds were incredible - the hotel staff was impeccable; always courteous and willing to go the extra mile to make sure that we were satisfied. The rooms were beautifully decorated and overall the hotel was simply the perfect experience! Everything I would have wanted in a hotel stay.

The Market in-house restaurant breakfast was great - dinner items and lunch items seemed to be more on the meh side, but between the service and the quality of the experience, I'd give this place six stars if I could. The surrounding area was exciting, there is a convenient supermarket right next door, and it's close to a number of great restaurants and the pier. 

Would definitely stay here again!",2013-06-05T14:37:37Z,106

1118,Shangri-La,4.3,"""Just as James Hilton described it.....a utopian earthly paradise, isolated from the outside world.""

There are times when you get a chance to get away for a holiday or vacation and you get lit up, taken a back and amazed by your destination. Well Vancouver is a great, lively, Canadian city that my g/f and I love to visit, and living in Seattle we've been there quite a few times (just check my other reviews). This time though I'm not going to say the hotel or property became a destination in itself, but boy howdy does it come close......

We were there for our annual Leafs v. Canucks hockey game at Rogers arena (3 years in a row!!!) and found online that the Shangri-la was first; running a special, and second because of this ""Experience Shangri-la"" package made it less expensive than our usuals (Sheraton, Hyatt, Le Soleil, Sutton Place), we jumped on it right away.

We arrived in Vancouver late in the evening, and since I didn't want to pay for the valet $39 Canadian (because we now have our own little secret parking place in downtown), and 39 dollars is not expensive, and not any more than other properties around the city. We found short term street parking so we could check-in, and I could go park my car later. In Lost Horizon by James Hilton, Shangri-la is tucked away in the mountains of tibet. Well the entrance to the main lobby, and check-in is follows that basic concept. The entrance is not on Georgia, but tucked away on Alberni with only a small sign leading the way; Shangri-la and an arrow pointing to the right and into a winding driveway down to the lower lobby where you check-in. However my girlfriend and I entered off of Georgia, next to the burberry shoppe, you are welcomed by two fu dog statues guarding the place (how very asian). Inside of the Lobby (off of Georgia street) is the concierge desk, some seating areas, Xi-Shi lounge and two sets of lifts (elevators). No lobby in sight!!!, as I mentioned there are two sets of lifts one for the residences called ""living Shangri-la"" and another set of elevators marked hotel lifts. We took it down to the lower lobby for the front desk (this is the driveway entrance off of Georgia). The lobby is small, very elegant, and decorated in an asian motiff (like the rest of the hotel).

The key card is unlike most other key cards at most hotels (you also have to use key card in the elevator to get to your floor), you don't slide the card into a stupid slot until the light turns green and remove to gain access into your room, no this is a little different. The difference is you tap a sensor on the door to gain entry into your room. We're not finished with the key card just yet. You need to insert the key card into a slot by the door to activate the lights in the room.

Ohh boy!!! and when the lights do come on, you have reached Shangri-la...the paradise on earth. We were staying through a Sunday and on sundays shoppes open late, and close early and my g/f and I for the first time couldn't wait to just relax in the room!! Ok so first everything is electronic from the light switches (complete with various settings; sconce, nightlight, reading light etc.etc.) to the controls for the shades and the blinds so you don't have to get up to close either, just the touch of a button. There was also a control panel for the do not disturb so when you pressed it a pad on the outside of the room lit up in red ""do not disturb"" and would turn off the doorbell if someone rang. There were also some goodies left in the room; on the coffee table a note from the manager welcoming guests personally (whether it was handwritten or not, a very nice gesture) thank you Richard. Next to the note was a plate of fruit, and on the bed each night laid a bookmark, and a small piece of candy wrapped in plastic (each night had a different morsel of candy from salted caramel, caramel, and a grape soft chew). The bed was a queen size bed and the best part about it was that the throw pillows, and throw blanket were tucked away in the drawer under the television. The only pillows and blankets was a very warm alternative down comforter and probably the most pillow selection types ever on a hotel bed (there is even a card in the night stand with different pillow choices that you could leave out and the staff would bring those pillows). The other treasure in the other night stand was a copy of not the bible, but James Hilton's Lost Horizon (some properties offer a complementary copy, Vancouver location does not!!!

1119,Shangri-La,4.3,"I love the Shangri-La! Can I live here if I win the lotto?  I stayed at the Shangri-La in Bangkok and it blew me away there.  But, the Vancouver Shangri-La did the same.  
We found a great deal on a stay three nights get the fourth night free deal.  From check-in to check-out, our stay there was superb.  A reservations agent did the check-in in our room.  And what a room! Massive tv.  Gourmet espressos.  Separate bath and shower.  Tv in the bathroom.  Vanity lights and vanity tables.  And yes a fantastic view of Vancouver.  I can't imagine what the suites might be like.
The service here was great. The concierge went above and beyond and if they didn't know the answer, they found out immediately.  Great at making us reservations.  Even the service to get a taxi was great.  They knew my name by the end of the first day.
If you can swing it, definitely stay here.  The location is great too. One block from Robson street and close enough to walk to Stanley Park, subways, etc.",2009-08-26T17:23:47Z,106
1120,Shangri-La,4.3,"The location is perfect for tourism as you're a few blocks walking distance to the waterfront, Robson Street (shopping), Gastown and the West End are close too. The hotel itself is modern and really comfy. Shangri-la's service is legendary and couldn't be any better. Love this place.",2014-05-18T16:00:27Z,106
1121,Shangri-La,4.3,"Consistently good customer service. The room was not as clean as usual in the bathroom for this trip. Was too busy to complain. Food was consistent with its star rating. The location is excellent, you are in the middle of everything you need.",2015-10-23T11:49:19Z,106
1122,Shangri-La,4.3,"We stayed here for a 3 nights a few weeks back and could not be more happy with our visit.  We had two rooms that were decorated great and were more than spacious.  The staff was super friendly and was always willing to lend a helping hand, whether it was with bags or with restaurant reservations.  You need to take advantage of their concierge service.  When you book with Amex Platinum you will get free breakfast for 2 per room and $100 credit for charges per room so if you have one of those definitely use it here.  If and when I ever come back to Vancouver I will be staying here without a doubt.",2013-08-12T18:29:01Z,106
1123,Shangri-La,4.3,"Has to be my favorite place to stay.  Great food,  service and amazing rooms. Always hate to leave, a must stay at place",2015-04-13T18:08:06Z,106
1124,Shangri-La,4.3,"We were a group of 8 guys on a bachelor party with a one night stopover in Vancouver; given the cultural Asian influence of the city we decided the Shangri La would be a fitting choice.  Suffice to say it was a GREAT choice with plenty of praise to boot.  Above all it was their level of service and attention to detail that has all of us speaking of that hotel to this day, we have all vowed to return with our significant others.  The rooms are spacious, modern, and extremely comfortable.  Highly recommended.",2010-03-29T13:29:52Z,106
1125,Shangri-La,4.3,Wow! Finishing up 4 day work meeting at this hotel. Our room was spectacular and the service outstanding! The rooms are high tech with many lighting and service automations. Even had an in the mirror TV in the bathroom! Not sure why you need a TV in the mirror but it is still pretty cool. They seem to think of every possible amenity in the rooms. The rooms each have a doorbell so there is no annoying knocking by staff or guests. Do Not Disturb is handled by pressing a button which illuminates a sign outside the door!....How cool is that? The food in the restaurant was excellent as were the cocktails. The hotel staff is exceedingly attentive and pleasant. I would highly recommend a stay here!,2012-07-21T19:28:29Z,106
1126,Shangri-La,4.3,"One of the nicest hotels I've ever had the pleasure of staying at. The rooms are super spacious with comfy beds, large sitting areas, a separate walk in bathroom with a shower AND a bath. It has a very authentic Asian feel that reminded me of the hotels I've stayed at when visiting China and Korea. Service was excellent, food and drinks were quite good, and, for the quality, its actually quite reasonably priced. If your visiting Vancouver and want to stay downtown near all the city has to offer I highly recommend the Shangri-La.",2013-04-04T03:32:22Z,106
1127,Shangri-La,4.3,"Exceptional service!! 
I have to admit that this place was beautiful and the customer service was great.    Derek the lower lobby door man, the concierge, and the welcoming desk people always addressed us by our last names and treated us like royalty.  On arrival we received a welcoming note from the manager, fruit, and individual walk through by a friendly face.  

The spa was great.  FYI:  All spa packages come with a private suite so treat yourself to the steam room and all the great amenities in the reserved room. 
 
The room had a great view, slippers, a TV in the bathroom mirror (yes inside), plasma TV in room, a beautiful bathroom, automatic lighting, Nespresso machine, and  L'Occitane En Provence products.

Everyone was attentive and in an era where customer service is almost non -existent, Shangri LA has exceeded my customer service expectations.  I love it here and am very excited to return to Vancouver for this experience alone.",2009-08-27T00:15:28Z,106
1128,Shangri-La,4.3,Great location close to some of the best restaurants in town.  Our room was a nice corner one with a small balcony.  Very quiet and fully equipped for a relaxing night.   My only complaint was that the room wasn't made up when we arrived back in the afternoon.,2014-12-06T18:36:38Z,106
1129,Times Square Suites,4.7,"After reading reviews, we knew we wanted a room in the back. We were VERY pleased with room 406. It was quiet and lovely. The full-sized appliances and washer and dryer were a huge bonus. We did have a car, and initially finding where to park and how to get in was not intuitive.  There is no lobby. You ring the buzzer and they will let you in to go down to an area in the parking garage. Once you have a card to get in, it was very convenient and we felt very safe all week. The staff is very helpful and there is someone available 24 hours/day.

The bed was very comfortable, and the bathrooms are fine. There could have been a little more water pressure in the shower though. The addition of bathrobes was a nice touch. We used them every day. We were also able to connect to the TV with our Netflix app and catch up on some shows at night. The wi-fi is good; just be prepared to sign-in to it with your electronics every day. 

They have multiple bins for recycling, waste, compost etc., which we thought was great. Canada does a much better job of being thoughtful about the environment than the U.S, that's for sure! 

The location was perfect for getting anywhere in Vancouver. There is a grocery across the street, a liquor store very close, and multiple excellent restaurants within walking distance. The bike rental shops are across the street as well. 

Our favorite part of this boutique hotel was the rooftop area. We met some of the other patrons each night. There are two grills and multiple seating for dinners and games. It was lovely!

We would definitely stay here again.",2023-08-31T20:02:33Z,42
1130,Times Square Suites,4.7,"I sure love this hotel! I have stayed here twice, once for a work trip in the late fall and once for a vacation in the summer. Both times, my stay was excellent: the rooms are SPOTLESS and the furniture, etc. is all in excellent condition. It's one of the cleanest and most maintained-hotels I have every stayed in. The location is great. And the price is reasonable for the amount of room you have in each suite, plus the cleanliness. 

TSS Is at the corner of a happening intersection in the beautiful West End, near a lot of cool things to do and some amazing food, but it's less overwhelming and busy than Downtown. It's a short walk to a couple of beach spots (English Bay or Coal Harbor and the corresponding parts of the Seawall,) and also a couple of blocks from Stanley Park. 

The rooms themselves are all suites with full kitchens and a washer/dryer, plus a living room, in addition to the bedroom. It's nice to have the option to eat in, even if it's just takeout or food grabbed from one of the nearby grocery stores. The living room also means a really comfortable place to relax when you're not out sightseeing (or working!) The rooftop patio is lovely.

The staff is friendly. The self-parking in the garage under the hotel costs money, but it's nice to have a dedicated, secured place to park. The building feels secure overall. My main complaint is that the rooms can get stuffy/hot, so be prepared to work on climate control when you're there if it's a warm time. (But luckily, they provide fans, all the windows open, and one of the bedrooms has a window A/C unit.)  Also, it can be a little loud (since it's in the middle of a city) but it's not too bad, and they also provide earplugs, which allowed me to sleep comfortably.",2023-06-26T04:27:50Z,42
1131,Times Square Suites,4.7,"Had a great stay, would stay again because of the staff, their helpful recommendations of where to dine and their great care of our needs during our stay. Would recommend staying here n we will stay again because it was great and in a great location.",2023-09-11T16:02:41Z,42
1132,Times Square Suites,4.7,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Times Square Suites. Nothing to complain about. We loved having a suite instead of a typical hotel room, since we were there for a full week. Having a full kitchen was nice too, even though we didn't really cook on this trip, but on a future trip we might buy some things at the Granville Market to bring home to cook. The king-size bed was comfy. The whole apartment was very clean, especially the bathroom and kitchen. The fireplace in the living room was very romantic and cozy. the secure parking was great for peace-of-mind. The staff was very nice and friendly. The location was close to many restaurants that we walked to, which was nice since it was raining a lot (for example, Tavola, Banana Leaf, Dinesty Dumpling House, Tetsu, Breka). Also, having the Safeway right across the street was extremely convenient for coffee, beverages, paper towels, forgotten toiletries, snacks, etc. I simply can't think of anything negative to say about our stay, except maybe that the bathroom was a bit small, and so was the clothes closet. But we could have used the coat closet in the living room if necessary (didn't need to, but could've). Also, it's good to know that the LR and BR both have A/C units, in case we visit again in the summertime.",2022-12-03T00:37:34Z,42
1133,Times Square Suites,4.7,"I love TSS! 
Location: In the West End which is a safe part of town. The Seawall is 2 blocks away in one direction and a little bit longer in the other direction. Stanley Park is also close by. It's diagonally across from Safeway, a liquor store and an ATM. There are plenty of restaurants in the area too.

Accommodations: We loved our suite. Everything was super clean and modern. The bed was so comfy too. 

The staff: They were so nice. When I called the first time to find out about availability (last minute), I was told that I could be in one room for 1 night and then would be moved to a less expensive room for the other 3 nights. I said that I would check with my husband and call back. 2 minutes later, he called me back and said that he did some shifting around and could stay in one room the entire time without moving. Sweet!

We loved being in Vancouver and TSS was a major part of that experience.",2019-10-31T19:29:24Z,42
1134,Times Square Suites,4.7,Friendly and accomidating staff. Clean rooms and plenty of space. Our favorrite room is the corner +Den on Robson. Love there covered Inclosed rooftop where you can grill food and chill.,2021-08-04T04:32:11Z,42
1135,Times Square Suites,4.7,"I stayed here with a friend a few weeks ago. I was very pleased with the room and the service. 

The room is well stocked and has everything you might need - a full size refrigerator, dishwasher, oven/stove, microwave, coffee maker, washer/dryer, ironing board, dishes, silverware, and cooking pots and utensils. We were only there for one night, but this would be a great place to stay if you were going to be here for an extended period of time. There is even a gas fireplace, although it's only usable during the colder months of the year. The furnishings aren't top-of-the-line (no stainless steel or granite counter tops) but everything was clean and well maintained. It felt homey.

I slept on the couch in the living area, while my friend took the bed in the bedroom. The couch was pretty comfortable. 

The hotel is in walking distance to a lot of good restaurants and places to shop. There is a Safeway located conveniently across the street, and a Starbucks right underneath the hotel on the first floor.

One thing I really liked about this place is that it didn't really feel that much like a hotel, it felt more like an apartment. When you get there, you have to buzz the front desk with the intercom, and they will let you in and send the elevator for you so can check in. It seemed a little bit odd at first but the staff at the desk were very helpful. 

Once you check in and pay for parking, you can get access to the parking garage, which was really convenient and easy to get to.

I've already recommended this place to several friends, and will definitely come back on my next trip to Vancouver.",2019-09-22T17:27:36Z,42
1136,Times Square Suites,4.7,"Third time staying at the Times Square Suites at the foot of Robson.... and won't be the last. The rooms are spacious, well appointed, spotless, comfortable, each with their own ambiance. Our stay this time was in a one bedroom/den combination under the clock tower facing Denman and Robson. On a cold and blustery two days, the natural light flooded into the living and dining room thru numerous windows and the gas fireplace made  the room toasty and cozy. The full kitchen is perfect if you want to home cook your meals. (Grocery and liquor store right across the street....) 

BUT, 

The location is spectacular... walking distance to Stanley park and also to the boardwalk leading to Canada Place. The array of restaurants, of all ethnicities, is amazing. Every taste desire is right at your finger tips. Two excellent Italian restaurants are attached to the TSS itself.... however, they are just the tip of the iceberg.

The front desk crew was helpful and very personable. Great lads. Don't let them forget to tell you about the rooftop BBQ and patio, if you go in the summer... and the selection of DVDs and books for sharing outside the rooftop door. Anyway, a great stay for one night or many nights. Cheers",2019-11-27T22:31:57Z,42
1137,Times Square Suites,4.7,"The suites are located in the West End, on the end of Robson where it starts to become more residential. This is a great place to stay if you're traveling with your family or just looking to save a bit of money. With a full kitchen and a Safeway across the street, it's easy to save a few dollars and prepare meals in the suite.

For the price (~$170 per suite per night), this place is reasonably-priced. The furnishings are on the older side but everything is in good shape - I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable the sofa bed was. The washer/dryer is a really great amenity for the suite.

The rooftop deck is a big bonus - it's roomy with plenty of seating (loungey and picnic tables) with a covered top in case of rain. There's also a high quality stainless steel grill.

The location can't be beat - this place is walking distance to a ton of great restaurants. I was there during a hot spell, and there wasn't any A/C which made for warm nights (and the street noise was a bit too loud to keep the windows open).",2013-08-30T01:24:04Z,42

1139,Times Square Suites,4.7,"Beautiful suites! Dining rooms, kitchen, den area with extra bed and near everything.

So, I'm a TREAT when traveling. I forget passports at home, leave my car keys in the town car pick up, and am almost guaranteed to drop my phone into water or off some ledge. 

So, when I travel, I look for places to rest my head that make up for all the self-induced stress I relentlessly seem to pour on myself. 

My boyfriend and I were sitting in a Starbucks, when we realized that the flight I THOUGHT I'd booked for midnight....was actually a flight leaving at 6am. SO--my guy started looking up hotels for us to spend the night in. 
Lo and behold, we saw that the nearest one was located right above us. Times Square Suites  was beautifully located, in the midst of a very bustling area. The suite was INCREDIBLY clean and lovely. 
They have a GREAT rooftop with a grill that was beautiful. It had a washer/dryer in it with laundry detergent (that we took advantage of.) Wine glasses, plates, bottle openers...everything you could need....it had it. Lovely balcony. Each room had it's own wireless key and code...which was so great!

WE had an amazing stay and that bed...was DIVINE.",2013-07-31T15:32:17Z,42
1140,Times Square Suites,4.7,"Times Square suites
Sweet!  This was a nice spacious situation for my parents and I.  We need separate rooms b/c some of us snore and others of us can't sleep through it.  

We stayed in a one bedroom suite and I slept on the pullout sofa.  It wasn't bad as most pullout mattresses are.  I slept on it for two nights and it was fine.  The front desk did bring me and extra douvet to lay on top and that was great.

The suite was clean and the kitchen was great too.  I was impressed they had recycling and a compost bin.

Whole foods is a short walk up the street and a few streets up from that is a lot of shopping and more restaurants.

It was a little confusing when we got there.  You have to use a call button to get the front desk to come let you in and the office is an elevator ride down.  They parking garage is in the back of the building.  They give you a garage fob and a key that accesses the front door, elevator and your room.  

They even had composting in the office!  I thought that was super cool.

The phone wasn't making local calls and because my phone didn't have an international plan on it they front desk let me come down and use theirs. This was super helpful as I had to make many calls to secure our lodging in whistler.

The room even had a washer and dryer in the room which really helped as it was the middle of our trip and we did a full load which helped us get through the rest of the trip.  

Free wifi.  Paid parking garage with security gate.",2015-06-30T07:12:26Z,42
1141,Times Square Suites,4.7,"The hotel is in an excellent location. We were able to walk to Stanley Park, the convention center, and plenty of places to eat. The food in the area is delicious and choices and varied. We ate everything from Malaysian to Ukrainian.

The suites themselves are spacious and clean. We had nine people in a two bedroom and a one bedroom. There was enough room for everyone. The kitchen has the basics and was clean, and we especially appreciated being able to do laundry in the room. People at the front desk were helpful when we needed extra keys and had questions.",2018-07-09T15:43:57Z,42

I will definitely come back if I am visiting Vancouver in the future.",2019-04-24T18:17:19Z,42
1143,Times Square Suites,4.7,"Awesome location, right in the heart of Vancouver (at least for tourists). We were blessed with a rental car, so having quick access to Lion's Gate, Stanley Park, Granville Island, and tons of restaurants walking-distance made the Vancouver experience *that* much more convenient. Right below is Starbucks and Whole Foods.

The building is old, but the suites were renovated and are a lot more modern that what you get from your first impression. Our view of the back alley was excellent (kidding), but it helped that it wasn't loud and we could actually sleep at night. The rooms are extremely spacious. This isn't Fairmont, but your wallet will be happy and so will your vacation-stressfree mind. 

Parking is in the basement, entrance from an alley in the back of the building. And our suite was cleaned every day. Thanks TSS!

Two nearby restaurant suggestions:
- Kintaro Ramen (RIGHT across the street. This is as good as it gets in Japan)
- Guu w/ Garlic (One block up)

1145,Times Square Suites,4.7,"just echoing all the other 5 star reviews!  this place is AWESOME, esp if you are traveling as a family.

1) location, location, location! right on Robson, but not the crazy part :) shops (local & chain), food (grocery, take out & sit down restaurants), Stanley Park, etc. are right outside your door. this is a GREAT spot, esp for the price

3) customer service was TOPS. all the staff were super friendly & helpful. great tips & suggestions for our stay.  they upgraded us to a large 2 bedroom, since there were rooms available.

2) lots of space! well appointed suites. took advantage of all the amenities. washer & dryer was a big plus. loved the fireplace & all the windows-- tons of light.  all the kitchen basics were covered.  no prob w/ the WiFi or cable (man, I could tell you some stories...) only bummers are no pool & the gym is about a 5 minute walk away.  but those were so minor, I am reluctant to call them ""bummers""

""What a great deal, excellent location, and a quality apartment. Such a value! The room we had included a den, kitchen with all the amenities/dishware, a queen bedroom, and bathroom. There is also a pretty roof deck with a grill, table, chairs, and lounge chairs. Great place for a drink before dinner. The hotel is close to everything and very close to Stanley Park which is a plus. Parking was around $15/day, but we had no other option. The area seemed very safe and had a lot going on. People have complained about the noise from the street. It didn't bother us when we had the window unit on in the bedroom. Small inconvenience for an excellent location in the city! We will be coming back and staying here as soon as we can!""

We thought it would be better to stay in a larger space then cram ourselves into a small hotel and it was a great decision. I really liked that we had a full kitchen and the living room and dining area were spacious. We definitely ended up staying in the hotel more than we would have liked, because my girlfriend got sick. But it was very comfortable and we enjoyed our stay. The staff was very friendly and the location was fantastic. A block away from Stanley Park and walking distance to everything. The Safeway across the street was extremely useful and the Liquor Store next to it was very convenient. Highly recommend for tourists.",2016-05-03T00:44:31Z,42

The lobby is actually underground, either thru the back alley - gasp - or the Robson elevator entrance going down.  Good protection fr the rain.

No public washrooms ;(

Did stay awhile ago, about $150-ish...and the pricing is well worth the area, near Stanley Park, Robson, English Bay...

1152,Times Square Suites,4.7,"Great spot for those from AWAY that want a kitchen suite not just a hotel room; who would like to wander downtown Vancouver, be near the water and yet feel safe, safe, safe. Fun spot for locals wanting to come in from the 'burbs for a night! The hotel is wonderfully clean though it has an usual design; like a friendly old apartment building turned condo hotel. It is tucked away at the corner of Denman and Robson and food places abound. A big bright huge Safeway grocery store is just across the lights for anything you need to fill the fridge. 

Take your gym stuff/bathing suit... we didn't know there was FREE pool access at the Denman Fitness club nearby and that would have been nice to know.  

THERE's a rooftop patio with a BBQ, what fun! Though this is ostensibly for the smokers in a non-smoking hotel, we were up there both days and the only ones there. The bookshelf at the top of the stairs has 'take one-leave one' magazines and paperback novels; some German, some Russian, most English... interesting. Definately leave your book once you're done... the little library needs the help! smile

We found the Times Square Suites to be in a great off-park location at the Stanley Park end of Robson street and would recommend it to those who like to walk downtown Vancouver. The staff really went out of their way to help us with information on vegetarian food places, and other stuff. Clean, cozy and pleasant, quiet inside the building though traffic and street noise of a busy downtown area. Homey and bright but not glamourous. Highly recommended and we hotel/B&B etc alot.

The location was great! The hotel is located a short walk to the entrance of Stanley Park, a short block to a main bus stop, and a few blocks either direction to the Seawall. Lots of restaurants in the area as well as a Safeway and Whole Foods. I was traveling solo, and I always felt safe in the neighborhood. Actually, I always felt safe in the entire city!

1154,Times Square Suites,4.7,"This morning we checked out of our Vancouver Hotel and are now awaiting the ferry to Victoria.  My regret is that we did not allow a minimum of four nights in Vancouver at Times Square Suites.  I can not say enough about this little gem.  It's not your normal hotel, there is not room service or fancy lobby.  It is the cleanest place I've ever stayed.  The beds, bedding and pillows are out of this world comfortable.  They have small window units which is unusual to have a/c in Vancouver.  This was once a small Vancouver apartment building.  Our unit had 2 bedrooms, living room, kitchen, one bathroom.  The only struggle with this place was initially finding it once we arrived.  It's on a busy street with no Lobby just a door at the street that requires a key (they provide that once you check in), once inside that door another key calls the elevator.  Upon arrival you must find the alleyway just passed the Starbucks on the corner.  Turn into the alley way then towards the big electric garage gate for Times Square Suites.  The check in office is in the garage.  Here they provide keys and garage door opener.  The room is stocked with every detail you might need.  Extra bed linens, towels, blankets, portable fans, kitchen stocked etc.  Each unit even has its own washer/dryer!  This may have also been the quietest place we've ever stayed although it is right in the middle of a lively working class neighborhood and busy streets.  It was also very affordable would have been worth 3x the nightly rate.  Ssshhh let's not alert the owners.  I LOVED the neighborhood, just blocks from the fabulous Stanley Park and little tiny mom and pop restaurants and coffee shops up and down every street for blocks.  The food in each one was amazing, we were treated like family and did not pay the normal high prices of Vancouver.  Our favorites, if we had to chose was Dynasty Dumpling House and Peaceful.  We also found a little dollar store on the street but not your normal chain, we got all those Canada/Vancouver shot glasses and magnets people requested for $1.50.  The little markets align every street where you can buy fresh vegetables and produce.  I could write a book just on the neighborhood, it's not fancy just normal working people coming and going.  Everyone speaks to you on the street we always felt more than safe.  Remember to take advantage of the beautiful outdoor space on the roof top, amazing!  Just inside the stairwell at the roof level are bookcases with books and DVDs for your use.  Update:  My husband left 2 shirts in the dryer at Times Square Suites.  We received an email the following day and after a quick phone call the shirts are on their way to our home via mail.  We would have never known where we lost those shirts, this is a great example of the extra mile TSS goes!",2018-05-13T15:39:44Z,42
1155,Times Square Suites,4.7,"As a solo female traveler I could not have selected a better hotel for Vancouver at an affordable rate. I felt so comfortable here and walking around this area in the evening by myself felt very safe. I went to restorative and yin yoga at oxygen Yoga several nights at a great rate. So many awesome ethnic restaurants right by the hotel and steps from Stanley Park. Help from the front desk was excellent. I am glad I selected a hotel further away from the busyness of downtown. The bed was comfy. The room was spotless. I have stayed at ritz Carlton and mandarin oriental and other 5 star resorts.  Of course those are nice but if you don't care about a fancy lobby and lots of amenities (which I don't) this was really homey and cozy!  It was great to have a kitchen, washer/dryer and fireplace. Roof top bar is cool too. And I appreciate their efforts to recycle and compost. This would definitely be my first choice if I return to Vancouver.",2017-11-05T18:10:43Z,42
1156,Times Square Suites,4.7,"I stayed at TSS around mid-February '14.  From the start the staff were more accommodating than I was expecting.  Someone met my wife and I for a very late (or very early) check-in after our flight was delayed.  The little touches were great; the starter box of detergent for the included washer/dryer, the variety of dishes available and the ability to control the heat for the bedroom and living area separately.  We stayed for a week and, while I might have stayed at fancier hotels, I've never stayed at one that was so homey.  Everything was spotless and tidy.  We will definitely be staying again.",2014-02-19T19:36:48Z,42
1157,Times Square Suites,4.7,"I will now try to stay at this hotel every time I visit Vancouver!  We stayed in a suite that had a master bedroom, small bedroom, living area, and balcony.   The room was perfect to split between 4-5 adults because there is a pull out couch.  I'm sure that it is competitive in prices even with hostels if you split a room.  We took full advantage of the covered roof top deck for grilling dinner and having a beer.  It's central location at Denman and Robson allowed for many bubble tea and gelato runs.  The staff are disarmingly nice and helpful.   I cannot recommend this hotel enough for short term stay.",2009-07-01T16:26:05Z,42
1158,Times Square Suites,4.7,"Awesome location. Very clean, very comfortable (the comforters are amazing, fluffy and crisp).  Our whole family liked it -- the tv had a dvd player, so the kids were able to watch a movie. There was a fireplace, which, as you know, is super attractive to teens.  The staff was helpful - lots of recommendations for restaurants and things to do.  Although we had to pay for parking in their garage, it was a good call since the parking in the neighborhood is tight and apparently they ticket a lot if you don't have proper city-distributed parking passes.  I especially liked how clean the place was. We had a fully stocked kitchen and I felt very comfortable using the dishes and pots and pans, etc. Oh, and a really cool feature -- a washer and dryer in the suite.  Very handy because it rained all day and we went on a bike ride for about 4 hours and were soaked.  Oh, and did I mention that the hotel is over a Starbucks (the coffee in the hotel is so so) and catty corner from a Safeway? 

We will stay here again the next time we come to Vancouver -- absolutely.",2011-04-07T15:34:20Z,42

1163,Times Square Suites,4.7,"Stayed here for our anniversary, loved it. It was so close to everything, and we really loved the fact that when we came to our hotel, it wasn't just a bedroom, felt more like a home.  They went out of their way to make sure that everything was good, and loved the little things too, like the umbrellas for people to use that happened to not own one.  Wonderful place, would highly recommend it for anyone",2014-02-23T22:56:02Z,42
1164,Times Square Suites,4.7,"Could not have asked for a better place to stay while visiting Vancouver to see womens' World Cup games at BC Place. So many dining options but also convenient grocery shopping (whole foods & Safeway) to save $$ & get good use out of our kitchen. 
Amazing location - nice walk down robson to bc place but even more convenient location as we could walk to stanley park. We also took advantage of the bike rental place downstairs, so that we could bike around Stanley Park as well. once we parked our car on arrival, we did not pull it out of the garage until it was time to leave.
Our hosts were very helpful in making tour arrangements and offering assistance whenever we needed anything (dining recommendations, etc.).
The rooftop patio area was very enjoyable to use... To Chat with friends or just enjoy a cup of coffee early in the morning (before the kids woke up).
We stayed in the corner one bedroom & den corner unit which was perfect for our family of four (2 adults & 2pre-teen girls).

I am rarely in Vancouver, but if and when I am in the future, I will certainly stay at TSS.  The suite - like a small apt - was light-filled and good-sized.  When I first entered there was a fan going and nice music playing.  Every little thing has been thought of to maximize one's stay.  Info book w/anything you might need to know during your stay, including how exactly to work the tv remote, watch dvd's, etc.  They supply outstanding coffee from a local supplier, and their toiletries are natural - loved them!  Several pairs of earplugs by the bed as an example of the little things they have thought of.  Good sized-kitchen, well-equipped.  Washer dryer in the unit.  I love this place.  Wish there were a TSS everywhere I travel.",2012-07-27T03:19:51Z,42
1167,Times Square Suites,4.7,"I would definitely stay here when I return to Vancouver. It's located on Robson Street so that's very convenient. I like how it's walking distance from the busy part of Robson Street. It's in a quieter area of Robson Street, but you still have Safeway across the street and Starbucks located right below the building. I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable our one-bedroom suite was. There is a nice fireplace, full-size kitchen, big screen HDTV with DVD player, washer/dryer, heater/air conditioner, double doors that open to balcony. It was super clean and smelled nice. I could imagine living there as long-time tenant if I lived in Vancouver. You feel like you're right at home, and the staff was very friendly. They even put your first initial and last name by the room # at the front entrance so that you feel like you're really an apartment tenant. I thought that was really cool because it gives it a personal feel! I left very satisfied!",2013-02-13T19:02:03Z,42
1168,Times Square Suites,4.7,Great suites and good location.  The rooms got a bit hot even with the air conditioner but luckily I was able to pull in a second fan into the bedroom.  The place is clean and well kept.  Resturants and Safeway is close by so it made this area quite convenient.  The only drawback is that I found that they kept making  a mistake on the bill but after several tries got it straightened out.,2013-08-02T04:31:52Z,42

1170,Times Square Suites,4.7,"I can't say enough good things about Times Square Suites.  Our suite was located on the 4th floor with balcony doors that opened out to Denman Street. With the windows open, it could be a little noisy during the day but at night it was pretty quiet and we loved the fresh air and enjoyed seeing trees with  brillant shades of red and orange leaves in October.  With Starbucks downstairs, Whole Foods and Safeway close by and too many wonderful eateries multi-national to count, this was the perfect location for us to be. The No. 5 bus was a straight shot downtown and the seawall was a 5 minute walk. Public Transportation was easy to navigate and the Airport was easily reachable. Times Square Staff was wonderfully patient with my many questions about where to eat, what to see, how to get around. And we can't say enough about the delightful bedding...so crisp, clean and comfortable. We are looking forward to coming back again. It'll be like returning to  an old friend's house..",2013-10-28T01:20:02Z,42
1171,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"For a 2 day conference, decided to stay at the Sutton hotel. Got a renovated room and was provided with complimentary slippers, as requested. 

First off, the hotel lobby is gorgeous. It has old style charm with modern elegance. I really appreciate the express check out box where you can drop off your room card in the morning. This was a great service as I had an early morning to attend Day 2 of the conference I was attending at the Convention Centre.

The renovated room was so much that I hoped for and more! The stand in shower is what dreams are made out of - large, with a built in sitying bench, and with great water pressure. The rainhead shower typically has low water pressure but not here! I really appreciate that it also have a handheld option, as I have one at home.

One feature I really appreciate in the bathroom is that it has an automatic sensor light. This is particularly nice when I had to use the washroom in the middle of the night and the dim sensor light was just enough lighting but allowed me to fall back asleep easily.

Another cute feature of the room is the turn down service. All other hotels I've been to have the annoying dirty door sign you put out - not at Sutton! There's a small light switch to indicate to the Staff when you want maid service (green light in the decorative lantern outside the room door) or don't wish to be disturbed (red light) - ingenious!

The room was beautifully decorated, had nice views, clean, and came with complimentary bottles of water. They also have a mini fridge, Kettle, and Nespresso machine for espressos. Although our room faced the busy Burrard Street, the windows were sound proof - so nice!

The beds were so comfortable- definitely one of the nicest and most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. The sheets were nice and I loved how they have fluffy pillows, not the flat down ones that are popular that I personally dislike.

One of the best Downtown hotel stays I've had yet - would highly recommend especially with that gorgeous dreamy shower!",2023-06-04T08:48:43Z,256
1172,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Location, service and condition, all satisfactory.  Sutton Place Hotel is right in the heart of downtown Vancouver, with cafes and restaurants an easy walk!  I arrived before noon, lucky that front desk reception graciously assigned me to an available room without delay.  

Seeing prior reviewers' notes on the previously worn condition of Sutton Place Hotel, here's an update.  The property was being renovated during my stay this week.  My room was beautiful, spotlessly clean and comfortable, facing the main street and quiet, even with traffic.  I appreciated the expansive windows, bright natural daylight flooded my room and the lighting is good enough for evening hours, working at the desk, etc.  Bed and sofa are comfy, small sofa table is useful for in-room dining and I especially liked the electric kettle, cups and saucers for making a cuppa.  Bathroom lighting is motion-sensored, a great idea for ease and safety. The hotel hallways and ground floor areas around the Lobby were being painted and updated, with work crews taping off areas to safeguard guests and allow foot traffic through.  I never noticed any renovation noise, perhaps because I was not in the hotel during daytime hours.  Everything felt relaxed and luxurious, including the rain shower/handheld wand, plush towels, hotel-provided toiletries, loofah sponge, robes and slippers.  YAY to the brightly lit bathroom and make-up mirror!!  That said, I'd prefer dispensers vs. tiny plastic bottles to reduce environmental impact.

Unfortunately the Boulevard Restaurant was closed for renovation.  Room service was tasty, if not timely.  Dinner entree portion was small.  So glad I ordered a salad too, otherwise, I'd have been still hungry.  That salad had a , fresh lemon vinaigrette, yummy.  Breakfast was just OK:  6 small roasted tomatoes flavorful and warm; multigrain toast much like supermarket bread out of a plastic bag, a disappointment; carafe of coffee was fine, but I missed seeing the 'notes' section of the QR code system for in-room dining!  The room service attendant advised me of the 'notes' option to ask for soy/almond/non-dairy milk, but I never saw it.  More's the pity, breakfast arrived later than my 6:30a.m.  request.  I have to get to work, so there was no time to enjoy it.  I scarfed down what I could, thankful to dine solo and forgo table manners in a pinch!  That carafe of coffee mostly went to waste,  a shame - no 'wake up, ramp up for the day ahead' coffee time.  Of course, there's nothing the room service attendant could do, but bring the tray whenever the kitchen had it ready.   In retrospect, better if I'd used the in-room coffee machine with the tiny pods of ground coffee.  Lastly, I dislike the QR code  menu system, but unlike many, I do not live my life on a cellphone.  

Note, there is no option to charge the in-room dining to your room stay.   Business travelers be aware, you will have a separate receipt for each meal.   In room dining order system requires payment (including tip, if you are adding that on a credit card instead of cash to the attendant) BEFORE your order is sent to the kitchen.",2024-03-21T22:34:23Z,256
1173,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"We've stayed here two times recently and the hotel itself is nice and in a really convenient area of Vancouver. The beds are comfy and the rooms are clean. Staff are really friendly and accommodating. The ONLY thing I wish were different is that both times we checked in the front desk staff said our room number audibly out loud, which can be very unsafe for single travelers or for female travelers, so I wish they were more discreet about room numbers when checking in guests.",2024-03-22T01:44:00Z,256
1174,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"I have been staying at Sutton Place (in the residences only) for years. It's always a great experience thanks to location, amenities and ability to bring my dog. 

This is a hotel from another era (built in 1986) of upscale properties, so if you are looking for modern, hip features, this will not be your place. Lots of marble and chandelier action, and some signs of wear and tear are present in the residence tower, which doesn't bother me since it's clean and offers spacious one bedroom apartment suites that are well appointed. 

The staff are quite good, and I experienced that during our last visit when our room wasn't ready at check-in. The lobby was packed and the check-in desk line was snaking around the room.  We had dinner reservations and had already had a long day driving and doing activities.  It was unclear when we would have a room. I haven't experienced anything like this before at the property, but there was a lot happening in town that weekend. 

Desk staff offered us free drinks and appetizers (they do have an award winning restaurant, Boulevard, on-site) and said they would compensate further later when I requested it. When I checked in an hour later, they continued to try finding a room that was ready and when they did I was given free parking for my stay ($50 CAN per night), so any cranky edges were smoothed over.",2023-02-22T01:02:57Z,256
1175,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Visited 10/24/22 - We drove up to see if we could check in early and had a charming introduction to the hotel. In the driveway, a smiling Stuart advised us to leave our bags if our room wasn't ready, and he directed us to the parking garage with instructions and policies.

At the registration desk, without a wait at 1:30pm on a Monday, we were met by another friendly employee who also seemed genuinely glad to see us and help. (Is it the hotel or is it the legendary Canadian friendliness?) She must have told somebody of our special occasion, because after entering our room, housekeeping came by with bottled water, chocolates and a card wishing us a happy anniversary.

We requested a room far from the elevator and high enough to have a good view. The powers-that-be granted both. The room is essentially as it appears in photos. The layout is spacious, especially for the price. But this is not a new hotel. You could say it's worn and a bit frayed around the edges. There's little here that's new except the sheets, toiletries and coffee bar items. But we chose it for it's traditional look and warm yellow color scheme and we felt it was cozy for having history.

Pros: location and price; staff; view from 18th floor; underground parking; speed of elevator; mostly quiet; Nespresso coffee; lots of outlets 

The cons: sheets are good quality (percale?) but a bit rough; bed could be thicker and more luxurious; shower is tiny; paper products are rough; soap is heavily perfumed; many fixtures are worn and imperfect (carpet, wallpaper, the entire bathroom, etc.)

The walls may be soundproof, but the door and windows are not. There was construction noise on our last day and the electricity went out for a few minutes.",2023-01-17T11:28:24Z,256

1177,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"The Sutton Place Hotel is past it's prime. What once was a thriving, classic hotel in the downtown Vancouver area is no more. 

My husband and I chose to stay at the hotel for our anniversary so we sprung for a top floor king suite. We were surprised that we were unable to check in an hour or two early (since it was a weekday and not too busy) and when told that they would ""rush the cleaning of our room and give us a call"" no one did so. After finally receiving our room the bellman did little to no effort to show us the amenities of the room/give us advice for the area. The room itself was in bad shape. Upon entering, unnoticed much of the furniture had big gashes in it/were covered in dust (umm didn't they just say they were cleaning it), the grout in the shower was horribly decaying, the water for the tub would not get hot, and the ""blackout"" shades didn't even reach the bottom of the floor so every morning our room was flooded by light around 6am! 

At one point I could see how this hotel could have offered a luxurious stay, however it has not been kept up with and the staffs lack of hospital passion reflects the state of the hotel. The concierge was the least friendly concierge I've ever come in contact with and if you are visiting Vancouver and seeking a luxurious staying experience do not waste your money here.",2023-05-18T15:05:47Z,256
1178,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"DONT go there is not worth your money!!
I arrived for the night because I am taken a cruse in Vancouver. When I went to the room a bathrobe was missing, I asked for one an took 48 minutes to bring me one. I went to the pool to relax. Unfortunately a baby vomit inside the pool, I reported it to the spa because this is a health issue so they can take care of closing the pool. Nobody came and people kept jumping in the pool. I reported it to the front desk and they were so rude. The lady in the front desk told me that the spa was a separate business than the hotel.
I went to my room and try to watch TV, but there wasn't a remote control  in the room and I called for one. They never brought it. I felt to sleep.
Next morning I asked for the remote and they finally brought it. I asked  to speak with the manager and he was very dismissive.

1180,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Beautiful hotel! The only complaint I have is that it would have been nice to have a refrigerator there. Oh yes of course there was one, but filled with drinks that are pretty pricey for what they are.

We got 2 queen size beds, and the bedding were soft like clouds. Driving 4+ Hours to get to this location was tiresome. Thank goodness for the luxury bed and bedding . I usually ask for more pillows because hotel pillows aren't firm enough. But these was just right. 

The bathroom was even better. It was a walk in shower with a ginormous rainfall shower head and also a long detachable shower head. The water could get really hot, so no issues there. 

Our room was facing the front, so we got the movie theatre view along with some eateries. Noise level outside on the road was minimal.

The pool was fun for the kids. It wasn't big but just enough. They did have a shower next to the loungers to rinse off and complimentary water. Now that I have never seen before at a pool inside a hotel.

I loved that a large grocery store is right next to the hotel to stock up the kitchen.  It truly was THE BEST hotel location in downtown vancouver, and the hotel is great for families.  The indoor pool was heated and is a great amenity that we didn't care if we didn't have free Wifi in the room.   Oh, and they even had a laundromat by the pool.

Despite the frustration surrounding the valentines-dinner-debacle, our actual stay at the Sutton Place could not have been more welcoming. 

We stayed in the King suite, and it was worth much, much more than we paid for it. 
Bright, airy, roomy, deliciously tempting snacks and minibar (thanks for the impromptu red bull after a long day of travelling!), and just a great time.
The only weird thing is that housekeeping came in twice in one day, even when we had the do-not-disturb sign out? I was mostly naked in the bathroom when the lady knocked and let herself in, even though I alerted her of my current state. She laughed and proceeded to talk to me about the mini--bar. Weird. THEN later that night around 10pm when I was equally (if not more) indisposed, they came by again to ""clean the room"" WTF?
Super weird.

The hotel is actually quite pretty/posh inside. We had a room upgrade due to my expedia points so we had a lovely view out to the shore. The concierge/front desk were lovely. You could either valet your car OR just self-park and take your things to the room.

1191,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"It was a very pleasant stay the the Sutton Place Hotel !

The location is prime -- located in the heart of downtown and right in the middle of all of the restaurants and shopping that you could ever want. 

The vibe is old school and classy. The lobby is super ornate and has gorgeous chandeliers and high molded ceilings. The hotel has two different towers and from what I can tell one tower is regular hotel rooms while the other is apartment style.

I stayed in the apartment side. I think it's a little less fancy but was still perfectly nice. The one bedroom apartment is big. Like, bigger than my one bedroom apartment at home. The room has a large bedroom, living room and bathroom plus a kitchen and dining space. If you are in town for an extended stay I'm sure it'd be nice to have the kitchen. Oh, and the room also had a large balcony with great views of downtown. My only complaint is that the balcony and sliding doors were a little dirty.

Another small complaint is about the elevators. The towers are pretty high, so prepare to wait a while for your elevator. They are also a little old and shaky, which I never love. Oh, and the WiFi is absolutely terrible. I got no service in the room, and only in the lobby. 

Overall this was a great experience. Oddly enough, this hotel is much more affordable than many others nearby. It was something like 250$ a night and most others that I was setting were $350+. It's clean and in a great location, so I'd definitely recommend it.",2019-11-05T14:46:11Z,256
1192,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"We had an amazing stay here at the Sutton Place. Caser (I hope I got his name right, from front desk) was extremely nice and helped us check in. All the staff here was so friendly, the room we stayed in were one of the newer renovated ones which was very comfortable and very nice. The location is great, definitely will come back again and stay!",2022-08-31T15:02:36Z,256
1193,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Okay joint. Lobby circulation is confusing to say the least. Elevators are ancient slow pokes. Humongous driveway dedicated to royalty who never stays here..... 

Interior is generally a little quaint of yesteryears' charms though don't look too close otherwise the dirt will show its deterioration and age.

Staff are fantastic, very friendly. 

Couple of okay eatery/bar in hotel on the steeper side of things. 

Great charity by giving to the arts-hosts sponsors VIFF 2019 guests and staffs. 

What could they do more?  Maybe a facelift?....or sell the air rights for condo development and get a free reno out of it?",2019-09-30T15:17:20Z,256
1194,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,Beware USD / CAD Conversion rate.  Hotel will try to get you to use a worse than market conversion rate for your stay.,2022-08-16T22:40:25Z,256
1195,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"This I my go to hotel when traveling to Vancouver. Great downtown location close great restaurants. The staff is friendly, professional and accommodating.

I travel regularly and at the top of my list when it comes hotels is cleanliness. I need a clean bathroom with no trace of previous guests - blech. The Sutton is spotless. They also have a well appointed gym, pool and spa. Need a nightcap? The restaurant bar is great (they make a mean Old Fashion) or you can try the wine store next door.  One final note - I hate waiting for an elevator and it seems more often than not that it takes forever when you're any upper floors.  Maybe it's a fluke or maybe the Sutton has figured out the art of elevator timing but the wait is never long.",2020-02-13T19:09:37Z,256
1196,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"I went to Vancouver for a writers' conference in March, and as usual, I stayed with my friend Liz L., who is on the same circuit and also much more on top of things than I am at all times. She booked us at Sutton Place because it was the same price or cheaper than the conference hotel, the Hyatt Regency just a short walk away, and it looked considerably nicer. I let time go by and then got the name of the hotel like right before flying out from Los Angeles.

As it turned out, I was very pleased with her selection. Sutton Place was clean and attractive, and the location was good. I enjoyed that the Japadog cart was parked right in front of the hotel when I got there in need of a quick solo lunch.

Our room was nice, with two comfortable queen beds and a decent bathroom. That's all I really ask when I'm traveling for work. I don't remember much else about it, which is probably a good thing.

I'd recommend Sutton Place if you're looking for an easy, pleasant place to stay in Vancouver. I'm sure the Hyatt Regency would've been fine, too, but I was happy we stayed here instead.",2019-05-24T18:17:22Z,256
1197,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Its been a go to hotel whenever I come to Vancouver however that said, I haven't stayed here in many years. The hotel really hasn't changed although I had read about the updated rooms which I requested at checkin. I was told its an additional charge of $40/night although my colleague was offered the same room type on a lower floor at no charge - not sure the justification given it was the only room available to me at check in anyway. Makes zero sense. The location is prime - ideally situated along the shopping and restaurant districts and very close walking distance to key waterfront centers. My upgraded room was nice, not great. The TV's are still smart, yet dumb. Most hotels allow me to log in to my Netflix with ease - or even airplay content from my Mac. Not here as its still on that dumbed down hotel TV system that you find at many hotels around the world. They have a fine dining restaurant and convenience store in the lobby and the staff try to be as helpful as possible. I do have an issue with security - nobody ever watches the front door and who is walking in and you can access most of the floors from the elevator with zero security checks or key access requirements. Considering the locks on the doors are jinky, this is an issue to me. I was finally able to find my safe located in the very back of the closet. They don't offer daily housekeeping unless you request a day in advance which is ridiculous at this point in the pandemic. Seems like an easy way for them to save on operating costs.",2022-10-18T05:34:07Z,256
1198,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"I have stayed at the Sutton Place hotel numerous times over the last six years. My previous experiences were fantastic but I'm sad to say that this time was not at all a positive experience.  The rudeness of the front desk staff was actually the least of our issues. The absence of cleaning staff due to Covid was noted ahead of time however when wanting to extend our stay we were told we couldn't even move into a new clean room after spending 4 nights in the same uncleaned room.  Here's the thing, I DO mean UNCLEANED: when checking out I was searching for a hair tie under the nightstand and came across a condom wrapper presumably from the previous guest.  Just disgusting. That definitely doesn't meet anyone's cleaning standards especially during Covid. 
When requesting towels and face cloths the front desk were reluctant to send extra up even though there were two of us staying there and go through many towels as we like our baths and face cloths to remove our make up. The front desk decided to have us check out and then check in instead of extending our stay (even though we would be in the same dirty room) and demanded another security deposit despite the first one still being held on our cc. When my gf inquired why there would be another security deposit taken for the same room the front desk attendant said she was abusive and he would now not grant our extension. When she asked to speak to a manager he replied he was one and that no one else was available. We retuned to our room to pack our things and then called down for a luggage cart and we were told that none were available. After lugging our numerous bags and our pets down, we saw the luggage carts in the lobby.  Whether or not they were ""unavailable"" due to Covid was never said but in either case it followed the staffs previous theme of being wholly unhelpful. 

Unbeknownst to the Sutton Place, there actually is a way to follow Covid protocols and still give quality service. I hope they can re-examine their employees behaviour and nip the attitude in the bud because it's not a good look.  The city has a lot of availabilities for hotels and many hotels have excellent rates so I can't see myself returning to the Sutton place when there are other hotels (pac rim, pan pacific, etc) that still understand the importance of giving an exceptional guest experience.",2020-07-02T21:46:28Z,256
1199,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"From the minute we stepped out of our taxi to the very last goodbye, this hotel treated my family and I with such great hospitality. We were here from June 30-July 4th.
Located about 30 minutes from the airport (about a $31.00 taxi ride), we were pleased with our stay here. The bellman and front drive guys were polite and always helped us hail a taxi. We didn't bother renting a car for various reasons but just an FYI, hotel charges $45.00 per night to park your vehicle.
Jen at the front desk was such a sweetheart. She went above and beyond to accommodate us as much as possible since we kinda hoped for our two rooms to be close by. She was able to get them across from each other. She explained the WiFi service to us as well as gave suggestions around the hotel.

Both our standard rooms were spacious and clean. Cleanliness plays a very important role and this hotel met expectations. You do get a coffee/tea maker in your room. Robson St is literally a street over and that's were all the restaurants, bars and shops are located. You also got a IGA market close by. 

Everything is pretty much within walking distance. Hotel to Canada Place was about a 10 minute walk, Gastown Steam Clock was a 15 minute walk and Granville Island was about a 30 minute bus ride.

It can get intimidating trying to figure out where to stay on your vacation, if you come across a good deal, don't hesitate to book.",2018-07-06T18:14:28Z,256

It is situated in the heart of the city. It is therefore, walking distance to everything (well, almost everything). It is close to Canada place. We walked to English Bay to see the fireworks, very near Robson street which is very popular for its retail shops, restaurants and souvenir shops. We also walked to the free shuttle bus for Capilano bridge and Grouse mountain. 

The staff was warm and ready to help and answer your questions. The hotel also has discount vouchers, just ask at the desk. 

The hotel itself was clean and bed and pillows were comfortable. 

You will enjoy your stay here.",2018-08-09T01:05:04Z,256
1203,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"This hotel is centrally-located in downtown Vancouver. It's about a 5-10 minute walk from Vancouver City Center station (Skytrain), across the street from Lululemon on Robson and Burrard, lots of shops, food carts/trucks and restaurants within walking distance. It's about a 15-minute walk to the Convention Center. It's a block away from the free shuttle stop to Capilano.

The rooms are nice and spacious. The room we got had a nice view of my favorite store: Lululemon. Toiletries include shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hand soap and lotion. I heard sirens (cops or ambulance) a few times at night but I'm a heavy sleeper so, as soon as I fall asleep, I'm out. I can see how this could be a problem for light sleepers though. 

There's free wifi at the lobby. If you want internet access in your room, there is a fee. The gym and pool were quite impressive. There's a restaurant and sundries. The service was good.",2015-10-15T02:49:38Z,256
1204,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"I have reviewed the Sutton Place favourably in the past but my recent stay during March 2020 as COVID-19 ramped up warrants another post for this great hotel. After the WHO declared a pandemic on March 11/20 it was startling how fast business closures, freelance work shutdowns, people returning home, social distancing and self-isolation became the new norm. 

I was in the hotel for a week after the pandemic was declared. With all things changing at lightening speed the hotel adjusted accordingly at every new turn. All Film and TV shows shut down in a single day and a huge number of guests left the hotel quickly. New guests were not coming. The restaurant, bar and tuck shop closed down when Vancouver announced all restaurants needed to close. Amenities like the pool and gym closed as the same happened with public pools and gyms. Occupancy dropped to as low as 10 - 15% and it was eerie not to see people in the hotel anymore. Still the staff did everything possible to service remaining guests. 

As we checked out of the hotel we were given water and wished well by several staff. Mail that came after we left was sent to us. And the hotel called to ask if some items we had decided to part with were meant to be left or if we had forgotten them. The Sutton Place has an amazing staff. Sadly, the hotel is likely to close along with so many other hotels during the COVID-19 pandemic. I hope the Sutton Place survives and opens again. It is a home away from home like no other I have stayed at. I will be sure to support them again and again.",2020-03-20T14:51:06Z,256

But the hotel has no free wifi. Maybe things are different in this country, but what decent place of hospitality leaves out a basic feature like internet? Or charges $20 per day. 

These rooms are not inexpensive. I shouldn't be Nickel and Dimed or forced out to a coffee shop to use the internet.

1207,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"My husband and I spent 2 nights here before a cruise out of Vancouver. Gorgeous hotel with a prime location in Downtown Vancouver. Its within walking distance to most sights - which worked out great for my husband and I since we didn't have a car our first leg of our trip. Unfortunately, during our stay, they had an issue with the A.C. units in some of the rooms. Our 1st night there was miserably hot for us (we like it cold at night). I said something to the front Desk the next morning,  and they upgraded us to a suite to accommodate. That room was still pretty warm too, but not as bad as the previous room,  and we cracked the windows open in the living area (its too noisy outside to open in bedroom -which is why we didnt the 1st night) so we were able to get a good night's sleep our 2nd night in preparation of the cruise. We were very grateful for that new room! 

All in all - the beds were comfortable, rooms were clean, and the staff was friendly. You do get charged for WiFi though per day. I think it was about $14 CAD. I'd stay here again next time I'm in Vancouver, and recommend it to others. :)",2017-05-30T03:13:45Z,256
1208,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Pro: 
1. Location location location. It's in downtown Vancouver, walking distance to all the shopping malls, food, water front, everything. 
2. Great service. 24 hour front door and valet service. 
3. There's a grocery store right across street. 

Con:
1. $48 per night parking, no matter self parking or valet parking. This is ridiculous! 
2. Don't provide water, no water fountain. The per night stay is not bad, but they are trying to make money out of other things, like $6/bottle water. Wish they were more environmental friendly and just have a water fountain somew 
3. Old interiors and not sure how long the mattress has been around, there's no support what so ever. Got headache from sleeping on the bed first night. 
4. Loud central air conditioning machine. I'm usually not a light sleeper. But I got woke up constantly by the AC. 
5. Not sure about the shampoo and body lotion bread they provide, so was skeptical to use them. And they provided plastic one time shower cap which was a little strange and not environmental friendly.",2020-02-19T21:20:33Z,256

That was the best decision I could ever made!!! It was the most amazing experience ever!!! The customer service is so amazing! They make feel so welcome and feels liek home! 

As soon as we got there they assisted us with our luggage our check in was till 3pm and it was 10am so they even gave ya a key for a change room and we were able to leave all our luggage in a storage room with the valet parking! 

We came back and they took our luggge to our room and omg the room was so comfy!!! It was perfect!!! Perfect view to the city!!!

1210,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"This is an older hotel but VERY well-managed.  It has an impressive lobby.  Elegant and attentive doormen...efficient counter staff...a very helpful and friendly concierge staff...comfy furniture to wait on for your party...lots of highly shined brass...cheery and brightly lit. Highly professional staff. Service everywhere we went in this hotel was top notch. 
Hallways are spic and span (other than the occasional room service tray).  Rooms were clean, with all the standard amenities - shampoo, soap, hairdryer, lighted makeup mirror-  but also shower cap, shoeshine cloth, mending kit, all you would likely ever need. Fluffy white bath towels.  A good layout to the room. Comfortable, clean bed. Excellent housekeeping staff; room was made up well with extra supplies where they noticed we had used them.  Everything was clean yet you rarely saw them.  Halls were super quiet, allowing a good night's rest. 
Upon our departure, we asked the concierge if he might help get us a cab to the airport, and this he accomplished in probably under one minute. Excellent cabbie, too. 
If I had to be picky (because there is certainly very little to complain about here) these are the only nits:
We were given the usual wi-fi login info upon check-in. But the login page warns of a ~$15/day user fee. I couldn't believe a hotel like this didn't provide free wi-fi. Desk said to disregard that; there would be no fee. So why tell your customers there is?

Restaurant dinner choices at the Boulevard Kitchen & Oyster Bar were a bit more than we felt like spending ($67 steaks) especially since weren't super hungry.  Really were just hoping for some comfort food (perhaps a hearty vegetable soup) after our long trip to Vancouver. 

Air in the hotel room seemed very dry and might benefit from some duct cleaning (room 623)",2019-10-03T18:30:50Z,256
1211,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"You want posh and elegant on a trip to Vancouver? Then the Sutton Place Hotel provides the ideal response in many ways. The central downtown location on Burrard Street is perfect for anyone who wants to stroll along Robson Street for shopping or down a few blocks to the funkier Granville Street area. Hell, even the Japa Dog stand is on the corner. Terimayo dog, onegai shimasu.

We had no complaints about our King-size room at the end of the hallway on the 16th floor. It was beautifully appointed with a large bathroom and cable TV. My photos will show you the spectacular view we were able to enjoy from room 1626. The service is what you would expect from such a stylish hotel - impeccable from the front desk to the guys who bring the cars. It's predictably pricey, although Jamie W. and I were able to take advantage of a 48-hour special that gave us a daily rate of $189 (or $220 including taxes). 

So did I have any complaints about the hotel itself? Well, I need to kvetch about the nickel-and-diming of extra services like WiFi access that costs $15 per day and the $30 overnight charge for parking. It just felt a bit petty for such an established, old-school hotel to add onto a bill paid by people who are probably stretching their budgets by staying there in the first place. That be me. Regardless, if you are in a splurgey mood for an extended weekend up north, this should definitely be a top consideration for you.",2010-08-09T00:57:42Z,256
1212,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Overall not a bad experience.  

Staying in downtown Vancouver, you have many options.  This place is pretty centrally located on Burrard street and about a 1/2 block from Robson street.  Easily within walking distance of many cool things in  the downtown area, translink buses and trains.   The best location tip is that the Japadog stand sets up shop just down the street from here! yeah! 

At $170 a night I felt like it wasn't outrageous considering the location.  The interior is pretty standard, nothing too exceptional.  Rooms are kind of on the small side.  Wifi is not free and is on the pricey side.  From what I recal something like $20 for 24 hours.  They even charge to use the business center computers which I thought was a little lame.  They do have a tiny work out facility attached to the Vida Spa and a pool on the Mezzanine floor.  I felt that service was very friendly and helpful.  The concierge was able to help us with tips on getting to places around town and giving us free downtown maps.

The rooms did not have enough lighting wven though here were 3 lamps, only 1 worked. Our room had a ciry view, so it was nice going to bed with the shades open to thw twinkling lights of the skyscrapers.

Our room had a LG flat screen, but tv kept going off due to not having signal. Tub was grity...felt a squeemish taking a shower.

Conveniently located in downtown/financial area. Location was nice and near Robson (mid to highend shopping district). A block away from the Fairmont Vancouver. Hotel peovides umbrellas for your use, even in early July they came in handy!

Bith morning and afternoon concierge were nice and recommended good eats in the area as well as surrounding vicinity.

We appreciated the quality of furniture and standard of care. The room feels luxurious. Location is also fabulous, being close to shopping, good restaurant selections and transit. 

Two flaws did damper our excitement though - 1) the wifi is crap. We've stayed at hotels where the internet was slow but this was on another level. Not only slow but the connection dropped every five minutes. We called to get it fixed and it did improve but still was only average. 2) the street is noisy. It's a busy street so be prepared to hear very loud sirens of ambulances, fire trucks and police throughout the day and night! 

We also really appreciated the friendliness of the staff; especially the doorman and the valet who were so helpful and genuine. The best surprise was a small token of appreciation from the hotel when you leave - cookies handed to you as you get into the car. It was a nice touch.

Called to find out what was available and was told absolutely nothing.

Checked online and found a suite with separate bedroom , king sized bed for $199. (so much for being booked up completely!)

Checked in with ease - staff was friendly enough and check in was prompt. 

Suite was HUGE clean and very impressive.

The bad-

Internet was Nonworking (or so i thought ) until i found out   it was an additional 14.95!! I really think its in poor taste to not have complimentary internet .

The morning paper which was offered for free never came

The mini bar wasn't anything to write home about and when i went to indulge in the Toblerone  it was completely melted (not needing it for a fondue i passed)

From the front desk, to the doormen, to the parking attendants, to the concierge, to the servers in the restaurant we had nothing but impeccable, professional, proper service. Valet is always there, even promptly when we got back from a concert at 1 am.

The rooms are clean and kept well during the stay.

I didn't get to investigate the spa or fitness center, but I plan on doing that on my next stay.

Parking is a separate charge.  However, that is the standard way of how hotels manage parking in Vancouver.  It should be free for guests of the hotel.

We had breakfast in the restaurant and ordered room service for dinner one evening.  The food was fantastic both times.  

The location is great as the Sutton is less than a block away from Robson, the best street IMO for shopping in Vancouver. There's a 3 story movie theatre at an adjacent corner.  A few restaurants across the street that looked intriguing but we didn't try them out.

Looked at other hotels, Expedia, yelp, kayak etc.  Since my wife plans absolutely everything, I wanted to plan the whole day and night for her.  I always remembered what she said, always phone the hotel directly.   Bonus free parking!  Ok nuff of that.   As another reviewer said the lobby is a little weird has no real flow, but again I didn't really give a crap until I went to use the hotub (nothing to write home about, pretty plain Jane pool area).  Walk thru check-in and dwn the hall....a little off putting when we both wearing supplied robes and have a few drinks with you.  The room itself was a ""classic"" king low floor room.  I thought it was absolutely fine for what we needed and liked the couch *wink*.  Coffee was provided, shower was fine, bed VERY soft.  Again, we were there one night.   Faaaantastic location to walk Robson for shopping, liquor, smokes etc.  Connected restaurant will be in another review, but was great as well and nice cause my wife didn't need to walk all over Vancouver in heels.

It is conveniently located in the middle of downtown near a lot of the shops and malls with plenty of places to eat nearby so that was good.

Onto the bad:
- No free WiFi. It costs $15 per day and it was absolutely the worst internet ever. I have had better connections using dial-up and even after telling the staff a few times, all they did was reset the connection to no avail.
- Valet parking is $39 per day. I asked the valet on the first day if there were other options but I was informed that everything else would be the same price even though the next day, I found multiple garages with cheaper prices. 
- Upon check in, I found my bathroom filthy with mold and dirt on the bathroom walls so I informed the manager who moved me to another room and said he would throw in an upgrade but to my dismay, I was moved to a much smaller room with a slightly cleaner bathroom.

I think any experienced traveler should be able to find a better hotel at similar rates.",2017-11-27T01:20:53Z,256
1221,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Stayed here for a night over the weekend - a nice little staycation in my own city! Central location near the Burrard Skytrain Station, shopping, Scotiabank theater, and tons of restaurants/bars. Free WIFI in the room with no issues in connecting.

We stayed in one of the Executive One Bedroom Suites on the 9th floor with a gorgeous city view of the city facing NE. The room was immaculate, inviting, and regal (love the French doors to the bedroom). The BED! Can we please talk about the king-sized bed?! It was so freakin' comfortable and spacious,  I could have slept in it forever.

Service is of the highest quality - and quick! Any time we asked for something or ordered room service, it came up just like that. We ordered room service for breakfast which came on such a cute little spread (tea, coffee, croissants, jam, honey, etc), I forgot to take a picture of it so you'll just have to trust me on this.

Since I live in Vancouver now, this is my first time staying at a hotel in this beautiful city and I'm glad the Sutton is doing its thing to represent!",2015-08-06T14:36:00Z,256
1222,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"This was a very good place to stay. From the time we walked in the front door until we checked out the service was excellent.  The room was very clean and extremely comfortable. The bed was perhaps the most comfortable I've ever slept on.  (I'd like one of the mattresses at home) 
The location is convenient to everything and  we'd definitely stay here again. Not sure what others complaints are about.  I certainly do not have anything negative to say. Great service,great staff, great price, great comfort.",2018-05-27T18:53:49Z,256
1223,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"I have been waiting a long time to update this review as we had had one experience with the Sutton Place previously and had had the pleasure of speaking to an extremely accountable and diligent manager who was smart, reasonable, caring and proactive. As we had gotten engaged at this hotel we wanted to return for  a night of relaxation and fun.
We reached out directly to the manager to inform her of our return and because a few details had been overlooked on our last stay, she kindly informed of us of a room upgrade and a  lovely compted brunch . We were excited .
Check in was early.
The room was lovely. The apartment suites are welll appointed for cooking and relaxing.
We  had a fabulous stay . The views of the city were stunning and we headed out for dine out Vancouver. 
Never miss the opportunity for brunch here. I used to bring my famiIy here for Easter brunch and their every day brunch does not disappoint. One of the city's finest and the Asian host is absolutely lovely and attentive ! He has been there for years and never forgets a face.
We want to thank the Sutton Place for being  so proactive and attentive to our last experience.  It's the most important to know you are a valued guest . We certainly felt that way and hope our pictures reflect our relaxation and joy  for the night.
Stay at the Sutton even as a  local for a night of fun and grandeur.
There's nowhere else like it !  We will be back for our anniversary. Many thanks to the fine people at Sutton Place Vancouver.",2020-01-28T10:12:46Z,256
1224,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"This was a great experience from start to finish.  

Traveling separately from my family to Vancouver, I had to contact the hotel staff before I even arrived to leave a note for my family that I had been delayed.  They were helpful and able to keep us connected traveling internationally without normal means of communication.  This trend of outstanding service continued throughout our entire stay and proved to be the best part of our stay.

Our room was spacious with a great view of the city.  Internet service was included with our room rate but it only allowed for four devices to be connected at once.  There were some signs of age and the need for updating/routine maintenance (peeling wall paper, sagging fixtures, etc.).  The housekeeping staff did a good job of cleaning the room daily, and my only negative remark would be that it took them two days to completely rid our room of all things feather.  With more than one of us having the allergy, it made for a less than stellar sleeping experience.

Last but not least, I would like to commend the concierge staff on their helpful suggestions throughout our stay.  Not used to the city life and being a few blocks away from the downtown harbor area, they were able to not only offer suggestions on where to go, but also provide the best transportation options.  Along with the front desk staff, they made our early morning departure for the airport seamless and exactly what we needed to start a long day of travel.

Thank you to the staff for a great stay!",2017-08-06T00:33:29Z,256
1225,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Reading previous reviews, there must be a set of rooms that have been newly refreshed, and others that haven't been touched in a decade; we stayed in the latter type.

First the positives. 

The lobby is nice, as were the staff. The hotel has a nice feel to it. And of course the location. Face it, it what you're really paying for. The bed was very comfortable.

Now what didn't hit for us.

The furniture was beaten to hell, and none of the drawers in the cabinet pulled straight. The only fridge in the room was a mini-bar fridge, perched on a broken shelf in the cabinet. Complimentary tea; no electric kettle. The TV and cable quality was straight from 2005. The in-room safe did not work.

And the most annoying thing was the cleaning staff. We checked in around 7pm. At 8pm we someone unlock the door and came in while we were in the room to ""check if they cleaned this room already"". Second day we were walked into twice by the cleaning crew. Once at around 10am and then again at 6pm. Finally on the third day, 10:30am there was a lady in our room again asking about stuff. Why not knock? The lesson here is obviously to bolt your door and put the DND sign out if you stay here. I've stayed hundreds of nights in hotels around the world, and this was a first. But at the end of the day, our bed was made, and towels fresh...

As other's have noted, you get nickel and dimed here ($20 for 24 hours of internet, and $40 or so for ""premium"" internet), but it's kind of the norm for these types of hotels in my experience. So, not really knocking them on that.

Admittedly these are all small gripes given the fact we hardly stayed in the room. We didn't pay top price for this--and I realize that might be the reason we got such a poor room, but they're definitely not selling theirselves either.

I don't think we'll be back. Especially given the other hotels we've stayed at in the same area for around the same price, and more, that provide a much more comfortable stay. The hotel portrays itself at a standard well above what it actually provides. 

And as a PSA: If you get a room facing Burrad, try to change it; it's a highway for police, ambulance, and firetrucks thoughout the day and night.",2017-09-06T00:09:05Z,256
1226,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Beautiful hotel located in the heart of downtown Vancouver.  

Upon arriving, we were promptly greeted and given help with our luggage.  After checking in and arriving in our room, our luggage was delivered shortly after.  The staff was so sweet and helped us by giving us so many recommendations on where to enjoy a night out in the town.    

I only stayed here one night but was able to see so much!  The hotel is located in a shopping mecca so just a hop skip jump away, we were able to do some major credit card damage.  At night, we walked up and down Granville per a recommendation and was able to find a club that suit our music preference and danced the night away.  I also HIGHLY recommend eating a hot dog from Japadog which is just located in front of the hotel.  My favorite was the #1 Terimayo.

This hotel is filled with beautiful people!  The Boulevard Kitchen & Oyster Bar, the restaurant connected to the hotel was alive with drinks flowing among an older but fashionable crowd.    

My only complaint is the internet connection.  There is a free internet connection but it was very slow.  Apparently if you want fast internet connection, you will need to pay extra per day for it.  For the price you pay, this should be automatically included.",2015-03-17T03:18:27Z,256
1227,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Worst experience ever! This has been my hotel of choice for the last twelve years, coming to visit family in Vancouver once a year. This experience has officially ended my loyalty to this hotel. Front desk staff was rude upon check-in and after that ordeal, I discover my room has no heat. I called concierge who said they would send an engineer to fix the issue. They sent housekeeping instead while I was freezing. The engineer came later to say that the heat is not big enough to heat the whole two bedroom suite and offered me a small space heater instead! Imagine, a five star hotel with no heat!!! I switched rooms only to find the same issue to which their resolution was again to offer space heaters claiming that there were no other rooms that could accommodate my family. I called down to front desk to complain about this ridiculous situation and to see if there were any other options but not only was I not offered an apology or a solution, the assistant front office manager Aldrin actually said, ""I'd be happy to book you into another hotel!"" What kind of hospitality and customer service is this? Especially coming from a five star hotel? How can a so-called five star hotel not provide adequate heat? Not to mention faulty door handles that locks you into or out of the bathroom. Had to get an engineer to come open our bathroom door after we got stuck. When I called housekeeping to bring some slippers (which are usually provided in the room but was missing in my room), she knocked on the door and unceremoniously threw them onto the floor at my feet and walked away. I've never experienced such a combination of abhorrent customer service all at once before. Thankfully the amazing concierge and security staff were able to make the situation a little better. Thank you Elan Hollander, Christopher  Marin and Tommy Luong - your actions and service should be commended. Unfortunately, I will never be coming back here again. In this day and age, you cannot survive in the hospitality industry with this type of attitude. There's just too many other options and competitors out there who would love to have my loyalty and business.

UPDATE: Got a call from the General Manager Navid Sariolghalam today and not only did he not take responsibility or acknowledge his employee Aldrin's actions, he refused to admit that there was any wrong doing, stating that they tried their best with customer service (really? In what world?). He wouldn't even give me an opportunity to explain the situation or express my dissatisfaction. If this is called hospitality, they should go out of business now. I called him on his bluff to book me into another hotel and I'm happily staying at the Four Seasons now with exceptional service!",2019-01-28T05:15:51Z,256
1228,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"This hotel is great only if you like an extremely outdated and dirty room, or if you like the feeling of staying at your grandparents house.  I can't believe how this hotel was rated 4.5 stars (dare I say some sites even rate this 5-star!) Our room was dusty, all the table tops of night tables, dressers, desks, and probably the furniture that you can't see.  They are in dire need of a massive refresh!",2019-03-19T15:48:15Z,256
1229,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"I really like this hotel.  I love how clean and elegant it looks with a very reasonable price.  Location is amazing.  Downtown and close to everything I had in my yelp bookmarks and it's safe.  There's a Japadog stand right outside as well as an IGA market next door to buy all your grocery needs.  

The only downside about this hotel is that our door does not fully close/ lock and we learned this the hard way.  We came back at the end of the day and the door swings open with a hard push.  So before you leave, make sure you securely close the door.  Also the free internet is pretty spotty in the rooms.  I see a lot of people in the lobby using utilizing the wifi.  

The room are clean and well furnished.  Staff was very helpful and welcoming.  I would definitely use this hotel again.",2016-12-05T19:47:31Z,256

Check-in was a breeze and the staff are happy and eager (but not pushy) to help. There are many high-end and other retail stores around the hotel along with coffee shops, bars and restaurants - all within walking distance.

FYI - I found out the hard way: The hotel charges $40 for valet and $40 for overnight parking. However, there is public parking across the street for way cheaper. Internet is not free and you have to pay.",2017-06-28T04:52:01Z,256

1235,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"As I am slowly working my way through our Vancouver reviews, and think it might be best to pick up with where we stayed. 

This hotel offered an assortment of packages when I was planning our trip and had good reviews on Yelp, and most of all, the price was quite right (still expensive) and the best part was the location and how walkable most things were. 

The only bummer was that if you booked the hotel for 5 or more nights you are automatically put into their ""apartment living"" side of the hotel. Suites that offer full kitchens and separate bedroom/living rooms. These rooms are fine and in their own part of the hotel, but the husband and I both felt they needed some updating. There were several flaws in the aethestics of the room from the toilet paper holder blocking a drawer in the bathroom to some typos in the room service menu. We had daily towel changes and clean up but not the ""full cleaning"" daily like the ""real"" hotel room have.

The package we had included either breakfast in the restaurant or from room service and we tried both. Room service was phenomenal for the one dinner we had the 6 of the 7 breakfasts we had. 
 
The Concierge Services were fantastic and the two people we worked with were quite helpful. In fact, all the staff were extremely friendly. 

The gift shop is more like a hole in the wall that closed at 6pm so one was out of luck in the hotel (no vending machines) if one would want say Peanut M&M's or a soda. 

There is a full gym (larger than I have seen), an indoor pool and a hot tub. The hot tub was weird with the bubble button outside the whole pool area. Locker rooms are nice sized, saunas are in each and the spa is really nice. There is also a laundry room and soap, etc. can be purchased in the gift shop. 

I really liked this hotel but I would make sure I stayed in the main hotel.",2010-07-23T00:45:13Z,256
1236,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,This is a long overdue review.  I stayed there a few times in the last couple years.  The staff there are very attentive and accommodating.   My dad uses a walker and this hotel is perfect for us to stay there as a family.  The valet service makes getting in and out a breeze.   Last time we stayed at their two bedroom suite and it was wonderful.   I will definitely return next time.,2019-11-22T05:48:35Z,256
1237,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"My husband and I decided to do a staycation downtown (Vancouver) to celebrate our anniversary. It was in December so we couldn't break the bank either, so I booked a 5 star hotel on Hotwire and got the Sutton Vancouver hotel. 

I was a little bit concerned because I had read mixed reviews and it seemed like those who got the hotel through Hotwire had bad experiences - possibly because they were given the non-renovated, however level, ""cheaper"" rooms.

I wrote the hotel, let them know it was a special occasion and expressed my concerns. It turns out I DID get a lower level room with 2 twin beds (one of the major complaints I saw in bad reviews). They offered to upgrade us to a king bed room for $15/night - so we did that. It was still very reasonably priced. I took some of the tips I saw on reviews and asked for a room higher than the 16th floor, and for something with a view, preferable away from the hospital (because of noise). 

When we arrived, we were greeted by friendly staff and were told we got a room on the 18th floor. When we got to the room, we saw chocolate covered strawberries on a plate that read ""Happy Anniversary"" in chocolate - compliments of the hotel manager. The room was perfect - we got a very nice view of Robson street and English Bay, it was quiet and the room was clean. There was a big screen TV and window was almost floor-to-ceiling. We loved the room so much that we ordered room service and set up our own little table for two by the window. It was very romantic :)

In summary:
- Very friend, and helpful staff
- Clean, updated rooms
- Large windows with nice view
- Gorgeous large bathroom with marble counter tops and floors. Shower and bath are separate and spacious.
- Other reviews are right - they have the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept on! If you are interested, they use the Simmon's Beauty Rest pillow top World Class 1 mattress.

My only complaint is that housekeeping knocked on our door at 8:30am. You can also hear everything in the hallway. But these were pretty small cons compared to all the pros.",2013-08-01T06:20:09Z,256
1238,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Sutton Place is my preferred downtown hotel. Have stayed over dozen times for business and family holiday. Many rooms with great views.

Consider staying in the tower for a room more like a condo vacation property. Also, higher floors for less street noise.

Service is always attentive. Greeted by name. On occasion, have been allowed to check in early. Now they seek to charge for that privilege.

Great breakfast for about $24. Several choices including menus for the many Japanese guests. Select room package with breakfast included for better value.

Parking is extra, as is the Internet. Annoyances in a luxury hotel.

Wide mix of guests: business, family, cruise ship, celebrities, and young affluent couples.

I might as well just lay on the floor.,2019-09-14T07:02:18Z,256
1240,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"If you can find a great rate, this may be the hotel for you just based on its FAB location but a 5 star, you may not find it to be.

The good

LOCATION - in the heart of downtown, restaurants and a block from Robson for shopping. You can also walk to the harbor from here.
Clean rooms
Nice big TV
Friendly staff
Restaurant on site and wine store next door, gift shop (prices reasonable) within as well as a spa and pool but for the latter, it is a hike to get over to that other tower and down the dreaded stairs! There is an outdoor sunning area too at the pool
Joey Burrard across the street makes a mean lunch (try the Ahi Tuna Club!)
Fast elevators 
No line at check-in

The bad

The hotel when pulling up is not as grand as the pictures plus for all the buzz about it, I did not find the lobby to be that spectacular
Small, somewhat dated rooms, dated furnishings, dinged walls
SLOW coffee machines in room
No free water in room
Internet $15 a day. C'mon, get with the 2013 program! It already costs a lot to stay here!
Tub drains immediately when filled, no proper seal = no bath unless you want to sit in running water the whole time
Small, low to the ground toilet
No recycling bin in room
Doors slamming in hallway are excessively loud

These are just little nit picky things but the small details make a 5 star hotel, 5 stars. The Celebrities like to stay here - maybe they have a suite (I am sure) or a residence apartment in the tower next door for their stay and those rooms are no doubt better, larger. If you like modern amenities, you may want to stay elsewhere. If you like European style, Old World Charm, this may be be the place for you!

The hotel lobby is really grand looking and has old world appeal.  The reception was kind enough.

I got a good deal on hotwire, and decided to stay here to end a long weekend in Vancouver.  I was unpleasantly surprised.

The location was excellent, right on Burrard, about a half block from Robson.  Our view of the city was also quite nice.

The TV in the room wasn't working, and I called reception to have it looked at, they said they would send someone, and no one came.  That was a bit disappointing, not that we would have spent a lot of time watching TV anyway.

The biggest let down was the bed - it was super uncomfortable and lumpy.  The decor looked ok at first glance, but it was really falling apart.

Central location in DT, close to shopping and restaurants.  Stayed here a few years ago and though the rooms are just right, the decor is impeccable, European inspired is the sense I got, versus modern decor like the Westin Bayshore.

What I'm impressed most is their concierge, seems like several of them have the Four Keys designation, some type of higher-standard level of service.  Not surprisingly, very helpful, in booking online reservations on Opentable, for instance.

And the bell boy/valet, also impressive.  I can literally drop off my car here, with my keys, for a quick meeting here, as long as you leave the keys with them.

Location: Right next to Robson St for shopping, IGA (nice grocery store) to stock up on essentials, wine store downstairs, and Japadog (kurobuta hot dogs) on the corner. 

Bed: Awesome. Heavenly. Enough said.

Suite: Wow. Spacious. Full kitchen with an excellent selection of tools. They thought of everything, knives, wine opener, vegetable peeler, down to a potato masher, in case you felt the urge to make mashed potatoes. Full fridge (hooray when you have kids), oven/microwave combo unit (so I could crisp up my baked goods from Granville Island), and   Nespresso coffee/espresso maker AND a coffee brewer. Lots of dishes and mugs and wine glasses. :) 

Staff: Very attentive and genuinely eager to please. I can't say enough good things about the staff. They were quick, efficient, and very welcoming to my small kids. They went to lengths to locate my son's plush that he brought from home. They understood how important it was to my son. They really cared and it showed.

My usual complaint -- no real desk chair at the desk and bathroom lights designed by someone who doesn't shave.  The maid cooperated in taking the (way too hot) duvet off the bed and replacing it with a blanket.

On my last night the hotel filled up with stunningly and/or outrageously dressed people there for the Vancouver Film Festival.  There were big dogs and little tiny play dogs.  Women in heels so high they needed oxygen tanks.  Everyone dressed in black.  When I grow up I'm going to run away and join the Film Festival circuit.",2013-10-09T06:15:46Z,256

We found availability in June and secured the last room! Phew.  It has a classic look to the lobby, high end, sort of older.  Properly attired porters and doormen.  Location is very handy.  It was about a 50 minute walk to our Event. Loads of shops, bars, restaurants, grocers, to walk to from the Sutton Place.  A nice merchant is located right there if you need to grab some quality beverages.  We were so excited on landing and getting checked in we selected a sparkling wine and 6 pack of local pale.  The Sparkling Wine was very memorable, Blue Mountain from Okanagan Valley in B.C. it was delightfully dry and the clerk even suggested.  That's an affirmation.  We got to our room to discover a wide, generous view of the city.  Loads of large almost skyscraper buildings.  Who is washing all those windows.  Anyway, I could gaze out that window all day.  It was especially nice since the day we landed - it was bright and sunny.  The amenities were nice, no fridge in the room, though.  Bummer.  
The beds were extraordinary.  They were incredibly comfy.  TV was fine, we had it on for background, opening day of football - but the guide was dumb.  It stated channel IDs, but not programs.  The concierge helped us a few times.  I like their style and demeanor here, straightforward, polite. We ordered room service one day for Breakfast!  Such a treat.  It was perfect.  I had a simple eggs, toast, potatoes.  We were on the 17th floor.  The price was reasonable.  I think less than $200 night for two Queen beds.  So worth it, warm hospitality, great location.  Pretty city, just needed a few more days of sun. One other odd thing, we had empty bottles that just sat there for a few days.  Left a note for staff to remove, they did. I couldn't find the fitness center - but I think it's in another adjacent building.  Was allowed an earlier check in - bonus!

Of note: there was a Santa graveyard below us.  The rooftop of one of the buildings below had a pile of decorative Santa Clauses, clustered together in the corner.  Kind of funny.  We didn't do any research on this siting.",2018-09-11T05:14:15Z,256

1249,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Stayed here for just one night on my spouse's and my mini 2-day post Xmas vacation.  We drove up from Seattle, and the number one advantage of this hotel is:  Location, location, location!   Right on Burrard and Robson, it is an excellent location to be able to walk out of the lobby and find tons of shops, restaurants, cafes, etc.   

The hotel does have a nice feel.  It was beautifully decorated for Xmas, with lots of holiday trees, each with a different color and theme.  The weather was gray and rainy, and they offered nice size complimentary umbrellas.  There was Valet parking, a beautiful lobby, and the staff were all very friendly and helpful.

Our room was nice and clean.  We had a flat screen TV, but changing the channels took great patience..   like a 20 second delay to change the channel each time.   Neither of us liked the full size mirror on the back of the bathroom door--  so you could watch yourself sitting on the john!  

We brought our swimsuits, as we wanted to use the pool, steam room and sauna.  Turns out that didn't work out too well for me.  First, you had to go through the LOBBY to get to the pool (which I would never want to do unless I was fully dressed in street clothes- I prefer places you can put your suit on in your ROOM, slap on a robe and go find the pool);  2) The dressing room for the pool is one level up from the pool itself;  and 3), there were lots of steps going down to the pool.  I am somewhat handicapped, so stairs don't work well for me.  I just skipped it, but was disappointed not to have a sauna.

The room was nice and quiet, and offered a nice view of downtown Vancouver, and many holiday lights.

In the AM we intended to eat at the buffet, but just missed it, so ended up ordering off the menu.  Breakfast was very expensive, for very ordinary food, but it was convenient and again-- the staff were very nice and friendly.

Overall, it was a very nice stay, great staff and a very convenient location.  We would definnitely come back.",2010-12-31T00:55:36Z,256
1250,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"I've been to many wine events here and this time we organised our own. I haven't stayed in the rooms but the banquet staff were great. They were so helpful when we needed to alter the way the room had been set up at the last minute.

The lunch that they served us in banquets was very tasty too.",2012-02-11T18:11:33Z,256
1251,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"The service was slow, took ages to get a room, Nd the hotel is more reminiscent of what luxury felt like in the 80's/90's. If you're 35 and under you'll feel like the youngest person here by over two decades easily. It's very old school and not in the good way. My room wasn't very clean (the shower felt like I was showering in a very old YMCA) but at least the wifi was decent.",2018-08-30T17:26:17Z,256

1253,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Nice location. Quick in and out valet even at odd hours. They do seem to cater to production people very well -- specially on price with free valet and internet. Never had a chance to check out any of the food services -- either room or at the restaurant so no comments there.

The roomI had was both quiet and pretty dark which was hugely appreciated when working odd hours.",2014-08-05T01:34:20Z,256
1254,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"This hotel gives the impression of being very nice: the trim and decor, the staff and amenities. However, having been here twice, I can say without hesitation that I will not return. Two problems:

One, at the restaurant, both times I ate there for lunch, I ended up with an extended stay on the toilet. I was not eating anything unusual or prone to spoilage. Clearly, the hygiene in the kitchen is severely lacking. 

Two, the toilets don't work. It really sucks to have a stinking load not go down on the first flush, nor the second, nor the third. I've been using toilets for a long time and I'm pretty sure I have the technique down: push the handle. The worst was the five-flush attempt this morning. 

My recommendation: take a pass on this hotel unless you like spending lots of time with toilets that don't work.",2015-08-23T16:06:11Z,256
1255,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Wasn't a guest here but my family members were. The place is super old and outdated. The rooms smelled like carpet that just had been shampooed - not welcoming at all.

1256,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Really a great place to stay while in the city.  Beautiful clean rooms with excellent views.

Excellent, EXCELLENT staff throughout the hotel.  Front desk was so accommodating, concierge desk bent over backwards to explain, show, suggest, even our housekeeper was friendly and very enjoyable.  We did not have one even slightly negative interaction with any hotel staff.

The Boulevard Kitchen Bar was the biggest surprise.  The bar itself was light and open, up a few stairs on the left as you enter from the lobby.  The bartenders, servers, and other staff in the bar all looked unhappy.  They didn't seem to enjoy one second of their work.  The poor servers were made to wear a ""pager"" on their dresses!  The pagers are the size of a flip phone and look like the anti theft devices retail stores use.  It absolutely ruins the look of a well groomed server in nice clothing.  I watched four "" suits"" walking around the bar/restaurant inspecting table settings, etc and wondered if the staff is being dogged by clueless managers out to increase profits at the expense of staff morale.  Pity, this should be the heart of the hotels nightlife, not a downer.

But the hotel staff were perfect.  I will recommend, and review, the hotel on the merits of their service provided to us as hotel guests. 

I suggest going to one of the many many friendly bars and excellent restaurants located in the immediate area for a memorable evening on the town.",2017-04-13T04:03:41Z,256
1257,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Great location in downtown Vancouver!  This hotel has very spacious suite style accommodations for the same price as other non-suite downtown hotels. We had a two bedroom suite on the twelfth floor and it was positively huge.  There are an indoor pool with jacuzzi and an outdoor sundeck as well as a gym and a spa.  The unit had a full kitchen, which was a plus in my book.  I would definitely stay at this hotel and chain again in the future!  One drawback was the long wait at checkin and the busy/crowded elevators.",2017-07-06T21:21:53Z,256
1258,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,Had a room close to the elevator. You can hear the elevator woosh up and down all throughout the night - very loud. Very hard to sleep. Avoid rooms near the elevator. Staff is not accommodating and front desk is a bit rude.,2018-08-01T06:34:50Z,256
1259,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"I am a person that bases my reviews, especially of hotels, on what I expect for the price I paid.  Although not the most expensive hotel ever, the Sutton Place Hotel was still fairly expensive and therefore I expect things to be worth the price.  Overall the hotel is nice but my negative first impression put a damper on my entire stay.  After walking with our luggage in the drizzle from the cruise port we were tired and hot and ready to get to our room.  Unfortunately we were too early to check in.  I asked if it would be possible for us to have a room early.  I was told no.  I understand that sometimes this is not possible but it was just the way they acted about it.  No ""sorry"" or ""we will try"" or anything at all, just ""no"".  I feel like most hotels that have guests staying in their suites usually at least try to go above and beyond for you and we did not get that service.  So once check in time was passed we were able to get a room.  The room was nice, large and clean and so was the bathroom.  We didn't really use or see anything else of the hotel but with the bad service and nice room I have to give them a rating of average.  I would not stay here again.",2017-10-16T03:26:35Z,256
1260,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Two colleagues and I had rooms booked for us for business travel. They both had the normal king suite that we were expecting... I had a room with two twin beds. What? Listen Linda, I have a bigger bed than this at home. It may be from Ikea, but there's more space at least! I didn't come to this supposedly fancy hotel to sleep in a twin bed. The rest of the hotel was really nice. I forgot my tootbrush and they gave me a little disposable one. The complimentary toiletries were decent. The bathroom had a separate bath and shower, which is pretty rare. I would come back and give them another chance, but with my luck, I'd get two twin beds on a trip with my fiancé. 

I'll probably come back though. Empty threat.",2015-09-04T03:16:42Z,256
1261,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"The concierge here was a big help getting something done for me that theu could have easily blown off and referred me outside the hotel to accomplish.  Appreciate that. This hotel is within walking distance of practically anything you want access to in downtown Vancouver. Many good restaurants surrounding the area too. The rooms are a little dated due to the age of the building but comfortable,  just lacking 5 star amenities in today's fresher modern hotels. There is an IGA supermarket next door so go there to stock up on your room supplies and even try their bakery for breakfast.",2016-06-29T22:17:44Z,256
1262,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Sutton Place was a wonderful hotel to stay at. The location is perfect. You are across the street from a movie theatre (that my husband were able to go to before dinner one evening). You are also located close to great restaurants and shopping. We walked to everything and it took no more than 5 minutes to get to a breakfast place and to dinner. The area seems very safe (even though there was a drug bust down the street one evening).

Our room was beautiful. We had a two room suite. The flat screen TVs were a nice touch. The beds are extremely comfortable, and you get a great view of the city from many of the rooms. The elevator wasn't always fast, but it was a very very busy time when we were there.

The place is a celeb hang out. I don't gawk at celebrities, but they seemed to be everywhere. Burt Reynolds was standing behind me in the concierge line. James Cromwell was checking in as we were leaving. Even Dan Cloutier was in the lobby. It was quite the scene. The nice thing, everyone left the famous people alone and just did their own thing.

The lobby of the hotel could be bigger. If you are meeting friends and family there to go out or whatever, there is no where to sit and wait.

Overall the hotel is great, but the best part is the location!!!",2009-09-17T02:31:17Z,256
1263,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Today, I had to attend a professional development class to learn about.......hmmmmm..... I'll spare you the details.

The facilities were very nice.  The conference rooms were well kept and clean.  Coffee in the morning was hot and lunch was not bad considering that is was one of those mass meals.

The design in the conference room area had French doors.  I like French doors.  In fact, I noticed that three of the conference rooms were named after First Growth Bourdeaux (Premier Grand Cru) wines:  Margeaux, Mouton-Rothchild and Lafite.  I wonder where the other two names were?   Out of curiosity, I looked but could not find.   :(",2012-02-24T04:56:17Z,256

This hotel is pretty close to everything, we walked to earls bar and grill and the club venue, just a couple blocks away. Staff are friendly and rooms are comfortable.

I left my jacket in the room upon checkout, probably due to the New Years notorious hang over. I emailed the hotel and the house keeping employee, Remy Corpuz, replied very helpfully. I had my jacket I lost shipped very quickly to me without any hassle. It's great service like this that will bring me back! (Hopefully next time with some Tylenol)",2014-01-14T02:15:39Z,256
1265,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"So I was moved from one hotel to The Sutton Place Hotel. It was late and we were exhausted. I was with my twin teenagers. The reason we moved was because although the hotel advertised it had an indoor jacuzzi, they had it closed due to remodeling. Before we changed hotels the Hotels.com agent called TWICE and confirmed they had a working  indoor jacuzzi. I have stinosis in my neck and the only relief I get is a jacuzzi. So we are checking in and my Discover card won't process. The desk clerk made me feel like a total degenerate as I had to get out another credit card. I knew the card was fine and confirmed it a few minutes later by calling Discover. Apparently it is common knowledge that Discover chips (from the United States) often don't work in Canada, you need to swipe them. Something I would think a hotel desk clerk would know. The kid at the movie theater selling popcorn knew, go figure. The doorman held the door for three different well dressed people but walked away when he saw us walk up. We were wearing nice jeans and sweaters, but I guess it wasn't worthy of doing his job for. The room, the heater had a horrible rattle sound that kept us from sleeping. It also barely produced any heat. We had to leave it on constantly to keep it above 70 degrees. The phone by the bed did not work. The tv remote did not work either. The windows were so dirty with fingerprints and smudges you couldn't enjoy the view. So, we get dressed to go in the Jacuzzi and head on down. Imagine our surprise when the Jacuzzi is empty. Yep, I guess they emptied it that morning. Perfect. Now let's talk about the business center. I needed to print off our boarding  passes and directions to get to the U.S. border crossing. Not one of the three computers would print. Nothing at all. I had to ask the snooty front desk guy who acted like I was some kind of a moron. Well he was one too because he also could not print  anything. It actually took the concierge to go into a different part of the building to print everything off. I spoke with the front desk regarding the jacuzzi and he did offer to not charge me for parking. A few minutes later he  called back and offered us free continental breakfast. I learned later that anyone staying there right now gets two free amenities anyway. So the breakfast and the  parking should've have always been included. When we went to check out, their system had crashed so I couldn't even see what they had charged me. So I wouldn't recommend staying here unless your dressed  in an evening gown every second of your stay. The staff and the property need some serious training and updating to pull off how snobby they are. If I had to say something nice it would be to the sweet lady who offered us a chocolate in the elevator. That was the highlight of our stay.",2020-01-26T22:41:53Z,256
1266,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"This is one of my favourite hotels in Vancouver!! The staff here goes above and beyond for their customers. The concierge was amazing on my last visit there.

1267,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"I want to say first that if you have money $$$ you won't see a problem with this Hotel but here is my review as a regular gal on a budget.
So after booking the Hotel thru Hotwire.com I then went to the Hotel's website, it looked amazing beautiful and luxurious but then I started reading the amenities:
*Wifi charge is between $14-$19 a night (it says you can share between 4 devices but it was so hard to share that we had to call the hotel tech guy and spend 15 min on the phone)
*Parking charge is $39.00 a night (parking across the street was $20)
*Local calls charge $1.50 a call.
Like I said if you have the money to spend it's not a problem but if not, they will nickel and dime you. 
When we first walked into our room there was a roll out bed laying on the room's floor, who knows why?! They said it was from the previous person staying but housekeeping didn't remove the roll out bed. We called house keeping to come remove it, 15 minutes later a gentleman let himself into our room without knocking while I was in my underwear changing, my husband had to jump in front of the man and kindly move him out of our room to close the door until I could run into the bathroom, embarrassing!
Our room's King sized bed was so uncomfortable I could literally feel the springs poking at my back and sides... Ouch! I guess I expected a nicer bed for the price of the room. 
Also there was a coffee maker in the room but no coffee to be found which we had to call room service and tip someone for bringing us something we should've had in the first place. 
Other than that the place was beautiful, location was great and the service was very pleasant, but I don't think I'd come here again.",2015-05-26T20:37:33Z,256
1268,The Sutton Place Hotel,3.8,"Apart from being clean and conveniently located, the overall experience was meh. 

One Sunday morning, they only had one elevator running. Waiting for an elevator was ridiculously slow, so a few of us ended up using the stairs. Luckily it wasn't a workday, otherwise I bet more people would be complaining.

Another problem I'm not comfortable with is the lack of privacy. I requested for shower amenities and the hotel room attendant barged into the door when I shouted ""wait, I'm coming"" as I ran to open the door. Also, I noticed some of my personal stuff were moved around when I return to my hotel one night while I had my ""please do not disturb"" sign on for the day.

While the room was clean, you could tell the facility was older. The shower couldn't be adjusted to a comfortable waterfall setting - it was stuck on a harsh, direct stream. This was perhaps our only complaint. 

Otherwise, it's important to emphasize the room was very clean. The bed was perfect after a long day of travelling. The hotel is close to some stellar restaurants.",2017-10-22T19:50:44Z,256

I would recommend the paralyzers and the bottles, and they're usually on special for way too little money. The lucky lager on tap isn't terrible.

1276,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"I WOULD NOT BOOK HERE EVER AGAIN. AND I MEAN IT.

I stayed here from April 19th 2024 for two nights. So as of the time of this review, I am still a guest here.
I feel compelled to write this review due to the customer experience I received from the front desk person on the night of April 19th, 2024 around 11:50pm.
One star overall for the excellent location right on the beach. Took off the rest of the stars due to the hostile treatment I got as a guest staying here. Staff seemed to treat me with contempt as if I was an inconvenient to them whenever I asked for something.

My husband went down to the front desk to ask if they could microwave a glass container for us, it contained cooked turkey meat and sweet potato. We were told earlier by a front desk staff that the hotel cannot provide in-room microwaves for guests. Fine. We were told by the same staff member if we brought the food to the front desk, the staff can microwave for us. So therefore, my husband went downstair to take the glass container with the closed air-tight lid and asked for the food to microwave. The front desk person, now a new person told us their one and ONLY microwave is broken. Surely, this is very believable for a functioning historical hotel right in the heart of Stanley Park. What a joke!

Now I am not new to customer service as I have worked in retail before. If you wanted to help you would. And this front desk person DID NOT. And she was just so dismissive she gave off the vibe I am sorry I cannot help sort of attitude.
She first told my husband no their only microwave is broken. My husband then went to ask the restaurant. And the person there was not helpful either, saying ""I don't have access to the kitchen after certain hours"".

My husband came back upstairs and told me they didn't want to help. I went downstairs with him because I just couldn't believe A FULL FREAKIN FUNCTIONING HOTEL CHARGING ALMOST 400 DOLLARS PER NIGHT CANNOT PROVIDE NOR HELP ME WITH MICROWAVING SOME FREAKING COOKED FOOD IN A CLOSED GLASS CONTAINER!!!!!!!

This made me so livid. My heart is still racing as I type this review.

We went back downstairs to ask the front desk person again and she kept repeating, "" I cannot help you, I cannot help you"". ""And the restaurant cannot help you because they don't want to contaminate the food"". Now how did she know that when in the same breath she asked my husband ""You said you were going to the restaurant, what did they say?"" But I thought you already knew the answer? They don't want to contaminate their food...right?

Then she calls security to ask if they can help. One staff person came out and he was totally nonchalant about the request. He said, ""Yea, I can do it"". NOW WHY WAS THAT SO FREAKIN HARD?????????????????????????????????????????????????
IT WAS A SIMPLE REQUEST AND IT TOOK SO MUCH TIME. AND WHY DID THE FRONT DESK STAFF TREATED ME AND MY HUSBAND WITH SO MUCH CONTEMPT?
Was it because we were Southeast Asian and she was White? Why did she have to dismiss us, be so unhelpful, not put the customer first, and try to help us solve our problem? It was a simple request. If a White couple came and asked, would they have gotten the same response? Did she see us and food and discriminate against us?

Why was it such a difficult request with so many bureaucracies attached? Was all of that animosity towards us as guests in your property necessary?
I will tell you one thing, you have lost a customer and I will be sure to tell others not to stay here.",2024-04-20T07:50:22Z,99
1277,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"Traditional hotel with early to mid century charm right on the water! Sometimes you book a place in another country and think, ""this will be fine,"" arrive and it is, you know, fine. Other times, you arrive and are so pleased you somehow made a reservation because how was it not booked solid? That was my experience with SH.

I didn't realize that I'd be staying at such a charming hotel, right on the water, next to a joy-inducing art installation, and so near some of the best food in Vancouver when I booked my stay. I highly recommend the Sylvia Hotel. 

The ivy covering the hotel was just starting to turn shades of orange and red when I was there, but I can imagine how beautiful it must be when the season changes! That being said, it was warm when I visited in the summer (end of August) and my room did not have A/C. I was completely comfortable with the provided tall fan though, especially after putting it on top of the dresser/TV stand and faced it at the tall bed. I also want to mention that the shower was hot and the bathroom was sparkly.

It has lots of history.  Don't expect much from the room and you will be surprised.  We stayed the night before our cruise.  We braved paying for a taxi and took the city bus. The Canadians were kind enough to help us find the right bus.  Once we got on and off it was easy.  I would recommend the place for the price and location.

It's located in the west end on the border of Stanley Park, and on the water. Everything is easily accessible by foot, and we spent a lot of our time walking the beautiful seawall. Although the hotel is a bit older, it had a lot of historic charm. We enjoyed the historic and romantic ambience. 

When we checked in, we were greeted by the very friendly and attentive staff. We were so excited to find out that they had upgraded our room to a suite. Our sweet was large, clean, and have everything we needed in it! It was so cozy, and we had such a fantastic stay. We would come back every time we visit Vancouver!",2023-03-04T22:13:30Z,99

The rooms at this older hotel are ample and spotless, the plumbing is newly renovated, while the restaurant and bar downstairs offer terrific fare and on Thursday night live music. Parking the car below the hotel eliminated the need to drive in traffic to see the city, so we used taxis and walked whenever possible. The staff was terrific and made our stay exceptional.

The food here isn't bad either as I had breakfast with a friend of mine and it was fabulous!

Better still, I was grateful for a large room with many windows. While I wish there were more elevators and greater parking, bottom line is that this fine establishment.

Im a little let down with my room however as it is in a later addition to the building that is really just a parkade and it lacks some of the charm I was hoping for. The bathroom especially the tiled floor are in serious need of an upgrade, and the hallway is kinda shabby with lots of scuff marks to the walls.

The thing that bothers me the most in not really the hotels fault. One of the first things you are asked to do when checking is is sign a damage waver including initialing to acknowledge this is a non-smoking room, Im guessing they all are, and when I enter my room the very first thing that smacks me in the face is that someone has smoked in here, maybe not the previous guest but it has the smell of many previous cigarettes enjoyed. I know it is hard to get that smell out, especially in a carpeted room, but it irritates my throat and eyes and really takes away from the enjoyment of the room.

1285,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"If you want a recent review, we are currently in our room right now. Our stay has been great so far. We booked over the phone and the reservation process went smoothly. Our room is on the 6th floor with a view of English Bay (I can't believe we got this for $100 a night on new years day!).  The room is clean, tasteful in decor with sturdy brass fixtures and solid antique furniture. They provide soap and a hairdryer but make sure you pack everything else, the free swag is pretty bare bones.",2009-01-03T08:36:06Z,99

Yes, not so great food, old smelly walls, disfunctional elevators, and old tvs.  That all makes up the great character this hotel possesses.  If you like old ones, this is a must.

1288,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"The location is fantastic - overlooking the water and right next to Stanley Park.  If there are any runners in the group, they'll be extremely happy.  One of the things I love about Vancouver are all the tall modern buildings.  But I realized this has come at the cost of most of the historic stuff having been torn down.  The exterior of this hotel is very classic looking, and its signature vines coving one of the facades was appealing.  The hotel was originally built as apartments, then remodeled later to be a hotel.  Fast forward after multiple insensitive remodels, and the interior of the hotel has lost nearly everything that would remind you that it is historic.  Dropped ceilings, modern doors, modern bathrooms...  oh well.  One modern amenity that has not yet been added is A/C, but we were very comfortable in May. As an American one oddity was the expectation you gave your single room key to the front desk every time you left, and retrieve it when you got back.  There was plenty of room to park in the garage.  I had a good stay and would go back, but wish it had a little more historic charm.",2013-06-11T23:33:21Z,99
1289,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"If you want a very old hotel, stay here. Teeny, tiny rooms, stale smell and a bug or two scurrying around. I wouldn't call this hotel historic or quaint. I would just call it old. It desperately needs a facelift. Great location, so find a different hotel in the neighborhood and stay there.",2014-01-28T00:16:11Z,99
1290,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"I've been a guest at the Sylvia since 1989. It is a modest and charming hotel. Although it is strange to remark about the hotel's cleanliness, one hears so many bad reviews on dirty but expensive hotel rooms; MY ROOM WAS VERY CLEAN!!!  The location is absolutely perfect; the public transportation is very easy to use so I didn't have to worry about parking my truck anywhere but the hotel parkade.  The reason for the 3 vs 4 stars was the front desk staff.  They were ""cool"" towards me, at best.",2012-10-06T23:37:53Z,99
1291,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"We used to stay here years ago, but it has gotten more run down and more expensive(not including tale to follow as one would expoect to pay more during the Olympics, well not this much more).  We stayed here during the Olympics-I'm embarrassed to admit we paid $350  per night for 2 nights for a crummy tiny room.  We booked it way in advance. We spoke to Canadians there and they were charged much less so we felt totally gouged. We had stayed there many times in the past and found it quaint and inexpensive (great location of course) I found trash  (an empty box that housed an Olyympic mug souvenir, not a used condom, thanking my luck stars)from previous occupant under the bed and brown stuff on the bedspread- hopefully chocolate....The shower walls were scummy.  The elevator was creaky and I was in fear of getting stuck on it, but the stairs were inaccessible. At that price, not even a cup of complementary instant coffee. The desk staff were young -in their early 20s and disinterested in making our stay a pleasant one.
Oh  but how I love your beautiful city!!!!",2010-10-18T04:51:37Z,99
1292,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"I can't speak for the experiences mentioned by other reviewers, but what I can say is that they don't match well with my own.  We booked with the Sylvia hotel mostly because they were one of the few hotels that clearly stated that they allowed dogs.  Honestly, we were a little worried after reading some of the reviews here, but by the time we realized this it was already too late to cancel without getting charged.  I'm glad, as our experience here was outstanding.  The hotel staff were all very friendly and the room was clean and nowhere near as small as others have indicated.  The beds were comfortable, the bathroom perfectly reasonable, and the view was excellent.  Sure, the elevators were small, but to my mind that is simply part of the historical charm.  And speaking of which, they make it quite clear that this is an historical building, so if you aren't interested in that you should probably go with another hotel.

As others have mentioned, the location is hard to beat.  I'll also mention that the restaurant was quite good, at least for the one breakfast we ate there.  In all, whenever we travel with our dog we'll almost certainly be visiting the Sylvia again.",2014-01-06T03:48:47Z,99

1295,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"This review is for the restaurant on 10 July. 
We arrived and my husband got upset that the chargers in the underground parking weren't available for restaurant patrons, only guests of the hotel. Seems kinda stupid to not want our money for that. 
We got to the hostess and we were asking her about if it was ok to leave our car after we ate so that we could take a walk on the beach. By this point the F&B manager showed up and was telling the hostess that someone was complaining at the front desk about not being able to plug in their car. I commented that that was us, and she said that she knew that. Why would you say someone then? Seems pretty passive aggressive to me. 

It was my husband's 70th birthday and the Sylvia was one of his favourite places. Despite the fact that we had made a reservation, we were taken to a tiny table in the lounge area. Things got progressively worse from there. We both ordered prime rib, medium rare. I asked for the jus on the side because they render it down and thicken it, which I don't like. No big deal in itself, just disappointing. I also ordered a glass of wine. Sometime before our meal arrived, we noticed Miss F&B was talking to our server behind the bar and pointing to us. Nice, eh?

Our dinners arrived and the prime rib was medium well! I sent mine back immediately and my husband was done with the drama by that point and started to eat his. About 10 minutes later, a guy from the kitchen plopped my plate on the table and high tailed it out of there. My prime rib was medium at this point. Not only that, it was piping hot so that by placing it in the Salamander to warm, it was over done again. By this time, I had had enough and just decided to eat my dinner. On a side note, the serving of mashed potato on the plate may have been 1 cup, but likely not even that. 

By the time the waiter came back to check on things, he did a really quick fly by, not really interested in hearing the answer, nor was he interested in offering me another glass of wine which was almost empty. I told the waiter this as I was paying the bill. Having worked in restaurants for over 10 years, I tipped him enough to cover the tip out, but not much more. Whatever Miss F&B had said to him, I can only assume led him to believe that we were just troublemakers. 
My husband had said we should probably leave after the beef was served medium well. I stuck to it. I really wished now that I hadn't. We were failed by the whole experience, and had to pay for the privilege. . Our difficulty about the parking situation should not have affected the way that we were treated afterwards. It wasn't hospitality, it was hostility. Goodbye Sylvia.",2022-07-12T23:34:31Z,99
1296,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,The Sylvia Hotel is a charming hotel with a spectacular location.  Our whole family was able to stay in the large suite. The beds and sheets were very comfortable.  We loved the stories of the hotel cat Mr. Got to Go that are available for reading in the lobby. Yes there is not air conditioning but the rooms had fans which kept us comfortable. We would definitely stay here again.,2022-08-09T16:54:37Z,99
1297,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"The old Gal is testing on her Laurels now. Needs a serious upgrade. Bedding is always an issue for me when I travel. And Sylvia missed the mark once again. The pillows are filled with what seems like a thousand cotton balls. No fitted sheets. Bunched up mattress cover.

Food at the Hotel.. ok now I know there is a staff shortage.. but a 46 min wait for a burger at lunch with half a dozen other guests in the restaurant. The Breakfast Parfait was a joke at 14 bucks. Frozen mini muffins...??

The standard practice of charging guests a hundred dollars a day for ( incidentals) is standard extortion in my opinion. In my case that was 700 dollars...just in case I had a meal or a drink and charged it to my room. Something that did not happen last year when I stayed. Ok yes it's refunded when you check out.. but still an expense some can't endure and an unfair gouge..

Coming back late to the hotel one night to find a dozen guests waiting for the two extremely small elevators...as the stairs are blocked after a time at night..was irritating on its face as there is no need to block entry to the second floor at all.

The location on the Sylvia can be an issue if you don't like the smell of pot or cigarettes.. Don't book a room on lower floors or at the (back) of the Hotel..just saying.

No.. will not be staying at the old Sylvia again..",2021-08-22T15:49:24Z,99
1298,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"We stayed here one night. What a nice little hotel really enjoyed our time here ! They are remolding and the halls were lined in plastic and the elevators were a little scary and small but it's expected for such a historic building. 

Room was perfect for my mom and I we had lunch and snacks later in the restaurant. For a Sunday night it was packed especially with live music. The nachos were yummy and a okay Bloody Mary. I would totally stay here again at location right between Stanley Park and the city. Nice restaurants and bars up the street as well I really liked it here for a quiet stay! 

Parking $18 a day you can come and go and $100 will be added to your card for incidentals.",2019-01-21T17:14:23Z,99
1299,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"Well... here we are again!

We're regular visitors here and although the service is sometimes erratic, some of the staff are great, and this is why we have continued to support the hotel. It's a very special place for us. 

Sat 14th August we arrived at 7:30pm and was turned away by Diane the new Manager, at the main restaurant entrance. There was a free table on the patio and we were told in an abrupt manner "" we're closing early and we're at capacity""... no apology, just a rude woman ( not knowing this was the new manager at that time)   I pointed out that there was an available seat on the patio and asked if it was possible to sit there. ""No, I just told you, we're at capacity"" she replied. We left and went elsewhere. 

Friday 20th - we arrived early evening at the main restaurant. I continued into the bar and was met with a stern, abrupt voice  "" you can't just walk in there, you have to wait over here!  "". I said ""excuse me""?  and she ( Dianne the manager) Pointed at the Wait To Be Seated sign saying "" there, as it says!"" - which has always related to the dining area ONLY to the right of the entrance lobby. She was, again, very rude and arrogant.

We have supported The Sylvia restaurant for many years and especially through the pandemic to help it survive. I only wish that a new manager would show respect to many of us who are regulars. While other regulars have all had different experiences with her, we have all found her to be rude. I can only imagine how she treats her staff if this is how she treats her regular customers.",2021-08-22T06:13:59Z,99
1300,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"I am really picky when it comes to hotels so this is high praise indeed.  I am an extremely light sleeper so I shopped around for some place that was quiet and based upon recommendations from a travel website, I selected this hotel.  I was not sorry.  Let me tell you what the room DID NOT have (for which I was grateful): a refrigerator (although some of their rooms which have separate kitchens, do), central A/C (or any type of A/C), a nearby elevator, or housekeeping starting early in the morning, slamming doors and chatting loudly in the hallway.

They did have housekeeping but they were quiet and started pretty late, at least on my floor.  So, the only other noise I heard were birds at sunrise which was acceptable to me.  The idea of getting an actual full-night's sleep at a hotel was a true joy (and I didn't have to use the ear plugs I brought with me).  

The hotel is at the west end of the City adjacent to massive Stanley Park and a neighborhood beach (English Bay Beach) which was heavily used.  The feel of the beach was different than beach areas at home (in southern California) because it felt like most people were locals rather than those from other parts of the city.  

I got this impression because there wasn't much in the way of vehicular traffic in the area.  In L.A., there are massive car parks with long queues near the beaches.  As far as I could tell, other than the one attached to the hotel, there were no car parks in the neighborhood.  Of course, some of the beach visitors could have arrived by bus from other parts of the City (the #5 bus became a familiar friend during my visit).

Because it wasn't 'swimming weather', the beachgoers were dressed in 'street clothes', having brought food or drink or a handful of friends.  It was a 'town square' of a sort with spectacular views of the Burrard Inlet which, by name alone, doesn't sound like it's that appealing but it is.

The hotel is old and the door to the bathroom, for example, had it's share of lumps and bumps but I enjoyed the character of it.  There were improvements that made sense like the dual pane windows throughout but, for the most part, lots of the original look of the place remained.

The staff was amazing.  Every person there was caring and knowledgeable.  On my arrival day, I called twice to warn the hotel that my flight was to be late in arriving (it ended up being 5 hours late) and requesting that they don't give away my 'quiet room'.  Sure enough, when I arrived, it was waiting for me.

The hotel restaurant was also great (I'm not usually a fan of hotel restaurants).  Good food, and good views of the beach.

I'll give a tiny demerit to the hotel and say that I emailed it twice in the weeks before my arrival and never got a response.  Not sure what happened there.  But, I did end up calling them with my questions which they happily answered over the phone.",2022-06-10T19:06:06Z,99
1301,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"I think the place has potential, but for the price I am simply not satisfied. From research I gather Vancouver hotels raise prices during tourist season, and I will be honest in saying I have no idea what business is like in the off-season.

First the pros:

-The staff are super friendly and eager to be helpful.

-The hotel is in a great location.

-There is convenient on-site parking.

- The room has good blackout curtains.

-Shower has plenty of pressure and hot water.

Now the cons.

-If this were not in Vancouver we would've gotten a much better room for the same price. At $250 US plus tax, you get a decent room in most places. 

- The bathroom door was missing when we checked in, but at some point in the afternoon someone must've come and replaced it.

-Skylights in hall are nice, but need repair.

- There are paint chips missing from the window sill. This seems to be a tiny thing, but bear with me. Everything is scratched and chipped and old. 

- There are few common hotel comforts. For instance there is no mini-fridge, no microwave and the only ice machine is in the lobby.

-Being Vancouver, there is no AC. This would be fine as it is probably not needed all that often, but leaving the windows open means no privacy. This could be fixed with curtains covering the lower pane of each window, as the windows open at the top.

I guess my biggest gripe is price for what you get. But I suppose supply is low enough they can charge what they want.",2019-07-11T20:34:55Z,99

1304,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"This review is for the brunch only. The four of us had brunch on Sunday morning and it was pretty quiet. Despite this we had pretty crappy service where I had to flag down multiple different waiters for water, milk and to ask for extra maple syrup. 

We had the chicken and waffles which was dry and disappointing. The salad that came with it was limp but the chicken was really good. The only thing that saved the waffles was the extra maple syrup which came in a tiny bottle that cost an extra $2.  Not very hospitable of this Canadian hotel restaurant to charge extra for the tiniest condiment bottle of maple syrup. 

All in all this was a pretty disappointing brunch despite the nice water views.",2018-04-24T05:33:48Z,99

*We've been coming here every year for decades. This hotel isn't for everyone. If you need fast WiFi, modern heating and plumbing, fast spacious elevators, this won't be for you. Part of it's charm is it's old and quirky with tiny elevators that only hold 3 people, and tiny bathrooms that wouldn't meet current building codes, and so on.",2018-09-01T00:45:23Z,99

Windows wrapped around and let in plenty of fresh air.   There is no A/C.   The room was furnished well,   My only complaint about the room was the bathroom sink faucet - the water pressure was terribly low.   The shower was fine.
And a small complaint about the two elevators.  They are clearly old, which fits the historic hotel, but one broke down for a day while we were there.

The restaurant, bar was wonderful.   The view of the beach was perfect.   The food was great and the live entertainment made for an unforgettable visit.

They have deadbolt lock for the room, so you will be using an actual key to get in your room. They have paper filing system. Elevators are old and super tiny.

We got a family room with 2 double bed and a separate room with an extra bed. It's very spacious and cheap for the price that we paid. Service was meh. We checked in and were given the key to our room. Upon entering the room, I noticed there were bags and luggage already in the room. Umm this is not good. I went back to the front desk and the girl realized that she gave us the wrong room! Briefly apologized and gave us another key. Overall, I thought the location was great. It's right across the beach, located near all the central places that we wanted to check out. However, I didn't like the vibe of this hotel. It feels dirty with the old walls and weird smell.

1313,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"We held our wedding reception at Sylvia Hotel in August 2021. They mishandled this important event in our lives to a gross degree and treated us with utmost disrespect.
Here are the series of deficiencies that took place:

In the morning of our wedding, the venue was not set up as agreed, that tables will be set the night before. My wife and her bridesmaids went there in the morning to set up centrepieces. There was nothing on the tables and they were not set up in the configuration we had instructed them to do. The hotel's event manager was nowhere to be found. We had agreed that he would be there all day to oversee our event. When my wife called him he said he is on his way. An hour and a half later, he still wasn't there.

Staff started to put linens on the tables but these were all wrinkled. My wife had to stop them and ask for these to be ironed. These are basic services. 

This stressful morning turned into an even more stress afternoon. At 1 pm, this event manager texted my wife to say he was going to the emergency room and that restaurant manager was 'on the floor'. There was no follow-up communication from the hotel about a plan B. On top of this being stressful and unprofessional, we believe Sylvia hotel did not provide an adequate replacement. We did not see this restaurant manager all night as she was obviously busy doing her job managing the hotel restaurant and not our event. As a result many things fell through the gap. 

When we arrived at the reception, no one from the hotel actually received us. we and our families had to look for parking as their underground parking was full. Only after time wasted looking a family member went inside to inquire and they gave him a parking slip that let us park in front of the hotel.

At dinner, our family's table and two other tables were not served their food until half an hour after everybody else was finished. They were disorganized and understaffed. Servers were going around asking our friends/family for direction.

We had agreed on installing a divider on the patio separating the side that we had rented from the restaurant patio , in order to ensure our event is private and that our guests stay safe, given that we are in the middle of a pandemic. This divider was not implemented. There was no security or anyone looking over the floor. There were non-guests seen wandering through our wedding unmasked. Our family had to ask them to leave. This is unacceptable. We trusted Sylvia with our health and safety.

We had also agreed that the centre table would be removed after dinner to add safe space for dancing. This table did not get removed even after this was requested multiple times. At some point our guests took it upon themselves to clear the table! 

When we met with their event manager initially and decided to go ahead with the booking, we asked to leave a deposit. He said that is not necessary. They did not write up a contract for us and we trusted that they will live up to the standard promised; especially because they charged 18% gratuity on top of everything. But the level of service fell very short.
We are shocked that they treated our big milestone with such negligence. 

We had agreed to meet with the event manager after the wedding to go over the bill. He was absent the next day and the hotel manager never connected with us about anything. When we came downstairs to check out the morning after (Sunday) we were presented with the full bill at front desk in the amount of approximately $14000. We explained this is not how we expected to do this. We expected to have a meeting to go over our event , not deal with this at the front desk where hotel guests are coming and going. We explained we had to move on as we were running late for an important family gathering. Even though we had been corresponding with the hotel for over 2 months, we offered to leave ID/credit card and settle the invoice when we came back later that day to collect our rental stuff. 
This front desk person said no that is not an option. We couldn't even leave to go to the bank. We were once again shocked and speechless. We felt we were being taken hostage. We could have walked out because we had no agreement/contractual obligation to settle up that very morning. We felt hostility from this employee. She seemed to have no understanding/empathy for our situation and offered absolutely no solution. 

This is all very wrong. 
They botched our wedding and they are still failing to own up to their mistakes. We have asked management for a refund for a percentage of the bill. Their refund offer is so low and inappropriate it is insulting. We have asked for the contact information of the hotel president but have gotten no response.

Alas, the memory of our wedding is forever tarnished; but we are sharing our experience so other couples do not go through the same thing we did.",2021-10-12T23:40:05Z,99
1314,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"This hotel is straight up charming and a gem! 
My usual hotel when I'm in Vancouver is the Westin at the Bayshore. But when it's booked or too expensive, this hotel is my immediate choice.

I've stayed at this Hotel multiple times. And every time, I fall in love with its old historic charm. During the warmer seasons, the vines on this hotel is green and gives the walls of the hotel that amazing green carpet of vine leaves. And during the colder season, the dried out vines gives it that old world hotel look. Don't expect any extra modern amenities from this hotel that you usually get from the bigger or more modern hotel chains. And that's part of the experience of staying at this hotel! The old historic charm of this hotel is what makes it unique. Also, you'll see pictures of the hotel and it's guests from the good ol' days. And that always a delight. The hotel bar is also worth a try. 
The bedrooms are average in space, the bed and pillows are soft and comfortable, the bathroom is neat and clean. 

Overall, for the price you pay (which is much cheaper compared to the bigger hotel chains), you get a straight forward and high quality hotel with the old historic charm.",2018-03-14T19:03:57Z,99
1315,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"No porter service, carry your bags from the curb, up the steps into the front lobby and go back in time, front desk staff friendly and informative.  Amazing that this hotel/building was originally built in 1912, only 2 small elevators, enough to squeeze in 6 people at the most, fortunately only 8 floors to travel.

No in room safes, all valuables can be left at front desk which has a bank security vault box system just like hotels in the old days.

No a/c in the rooms so beware if you visit during the summer months.

I stayed due to a recommendation from a friend, so I fully knew what I was getting in to. No bells and whistles, just pure enjoyment and living for the moment knowing you're staying in a building over 100 years old!

5 stars for the location, across the street is the English Bay Beach Park and further up the road is Stanley Park.  Hungry, walk to Denman street and pick your choice of the many restaurant and bars.

One of the most unique and memorable hotels I've ever stayed in, do it and you won't regret it",2014-06-16T17:34:21Z,99
1316,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"Great place to stay! Affordable and right across from the water; great place to watch the sunset.  There's a bar that does live music that doesn't get overly crowded like the other restaurants by the water. It's about a 15 min walk to downtown, also just a 15 min walk to Granville Island ferry. Stanley Park is about a 30 min walk but easy cab ride if you're not up for the walk.  Great walking neighborhood as well. We had a king room that was really spacious. I would certainly recommend this hotel.",2018-03-14T05:10:30Z,99
1317,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"The Sylvia has a pretty vine-covered exterior and a historic looking lobby and restaurant, plus it's in a great location. Walk across a narrow street and you're at the seawall. Walk five minutes down the sidewalk, you're in Stanley Park.
The rooms are nothing to get excited about, other than the great views if you're facing the seawall. They're a bit basic, with the couch creaking like mad and the heating putting out just slightly warm air into the space between the curtains and the wall. It doesn't matter really when the location and the hotel bar & restaurant are this good. 
From the maid service to the front desk to the bartender, every Sylvia employee we came across in our week here was so friendly and welcoming. Every single one of them. This is the place I'd stay anytime I return to Vancouver.",2019-10-10T21:27:28Z,99
1318,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"The bed was amazing! Everything else was ancient-looking and the in-room extras were minimal to say the least. And the dark closet sure could use a light. The funny thing is, the bathroom looked renovated (clean grout and no chips on the laminate). It was done in that out dated look everybody likes (not). Even the brand new carpet was dreary. But the green paint!! Oh my gosh.

Having to leave your key each time you leave is bizarre.

The only good things are the restaurant and the location. And, as mentioned, the amazing bed.",2018-02-08T00:38:56Z,99
1319,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"I enjoyed my stay here for 3 nights while visiting Vancouver. It is a rustic hotel but functions well. And the location is prime!! You can walk to the beach, Stanley park, restaurants and several bus stops going every which direction only a block away.  

Due to its older style, they don't have electronic keys and just issue a single regular door key. With multiple people staying, this can be an inconvenience.  We had the last person leaving leave the key at the front desk for who ever came back and needed it first. This worked well.  The rooms have mini fridges which is nice and not common in hotels. No safe in room available though. The hotel has no AC but when we visited (start of June), we didn't need it. We had one fan and it was hardly utilized. The beds were comfy enough and room service did an as expected job. 

I enjoyed my stay at The Sylvia and would recommend it to anyone wanting to stay on the Stanley Park end of Vancouver.",2017-07-08T20:33:28Z,99
1320,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"We have been going to the Sylvia for years staying in the hotel every year for the awesome Christmas dinner. Breakfast is usually great as well (my fav is the seafood benny) and then we walk on the beach. We generally go to the pub on Sunday for the prime rib dinner and the live band. As far as ratings go I give the view 100 out of 10, the staff and service 100 out of 10 and the food a solid 4 out of 5. Great ambiance and you never know what celebrities will show up. Back in the old days Errol Flyn was a regular in the pub and in .modern times we have seen Greg keelor of Blue Rodeo and some of the Supernatural cast in there  plus some big name movie stars filming in town as well. All in all a good experience!",2019-04-02T11:14:57Z,99
1321,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"This was a last minute find and I'm happy we found it! The room was spacious and classic. Felt like an old apartment building that was turned into a hotel, but with the classy aspects retained. With the windows open and a breeze moving through, it was awesome. Would definitely stay there again. Staff was courteous, rooms were very clean. 

Restaurant attached was kinda strange, but I live in New Orleans, so I couldn't imagine a New Orleans themed restaurant to be anything but strange. This hotel is situated near so many restaurants, though, that you will have no problem finding any kind of food that you want.",2016-08-02T15:21:45Z,99
1322,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"Okay, I'm giving this place 3 stars, just because.....1) We didn't encounter bedbugs. 2)The windows opened just enough to let the natural gas smell out of the little kitchen area. 3) The view of the water, from the lobby, is not to be missed!

Granted we stayed here but once, and that was quite a while ago.  I just looked at the website and from it I'd guess a few things have changed.  As in they have taken out the little kitchen areas in the rooms and the bed spreads have changed from the 50's to the 70's era.

For an adventure, meaning being really close to Stanley Park, bring your camping gear and check this place out...",2008-08-08T15:02:56Z,99
1323,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,Great location and great views. That's what sells this hotel. The building itself is very pretty. The inside needs some updating. Thin doors. Musty smell. Old dirty feel. The price was decent. Location is the main perk to this hotel.,2017-10-01T20:47:38Z,99
1324,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"The Sylvia hotel is a wonderful spot with fantastic views. Established in 1912 this hotel is cozy and is more like living in your own apartment. Very similar to some of the flats I have lived in, in San Francisco. I love that we are across from the English Bay, very near Davie Street in the West End and Stanley Park.",2016-04-06T04:04:25Z,99

 Great stay!!",2017-06-23T13:25:40Z,99
1326,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"This hotel came highly recommended by a friend who frequents this location.  We planned a long weekend trip and really enjoyed our stay at the Sylvia Hotel.  The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly.  Front desk is available 24 hours.  What we love the most about this hotel is the location and that it's dog friendly!

We got a corner room facing the bay, and was able to have our dog with us for the weekend-- and not additional pet cost.  We went for walks along the beach (tons of walking and bike paths) and so close to Stanley Park.  BC has so many dog friendly spots that we took our dog everywhere-- even Capilano Suspension Bridge Park.

We were able to walk a block to Denman street-- and only a half a mile from Robson Street.  They also have a parking garage which allows in and out privileges at $18 a day (not bad).

Older hotel, but the service and location are fantastic. It's got it's old english charm.  We will be back!",2016-03-08T06:05:17Z,99
1327,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,Great location but the rooms and bathrooms are seriously outdated. If you like a little bit of luxury...this definitely isn't it. That being said they have a great bar overlooking the bay and the food was pretty darn good!,2018-04-25T15:05:04Z,99
1328,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"I give this place a 4.5 out of 5 if I could!  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star review is that it is an older building that needs repairs and every time I have stayed there, it's been under some kind of construction.  Other than that, it is a truly wonderful location near Stanley Park, lots of restaurants, shops and the beach.  It is an old building covered in ivy vines so it is very classic looking.  The inside has lots of dark woodwork and antique furniture.  The rooms are pretty basic and for the location in Vancouver's west end you can't get a nicer place for the price.  The guest services counter will exchange money.  There's a parking ramp under ground for guests.  A bar is next door in the same building but we have never tried it.  We plan to be back for another stay!",2017-11-27T03:31:15Z,99
1329,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"Love it . . . Except . . . 
The location is perfect for us, on the beach, near excellent biking and walking, restaurants nearby. The room was spacious and quiet, great bed. The exception? WiFi. Infuriatingly inconsistent, more often unavailable than able to get on. Hard to research anything or keep in touch with essentially no connection. They fix that, and it's the prefect place to stay.",2018-07-04T23:01:34Z,99

Rooms are not cleaned thoroughly; dirt on moldings and ledges -- where else?  The bathroom door would not shut and the room was so tiny for the price.

It is the perfect location, but management needs to put more attention into the hotel.",2015-08-18T22:51:43Z,99

It's also within easy walking/bus distance from the Art Gallery, Gas Town, and Granville Island ferry, plus perfectly located for any kind of food your heart desires, all more affordable than the tourist areas.   To boot (in addition), the restaurant and lounge have a gorgeous view of English Bay, a friendly staff, and a nice, varied, and affordable menu.  The staff of the hotel are friendly, courteous and helpful.  When there was a problem with the shower plumbing upon our arrival, they upgraded us, no questions asked.

1335,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"Death at the Sylvia Hotel

One night, we heard some squeaking. I thought it was perhaps the bed. But it happened when we didn't even move. My husband, in charge of general animal affairs and spider-squashing, searched our hotel room for the source of the sound.

To our amazement, he found a poor little mouse stuck in a trap beneath one of the wardrobes. We called the front desk and some dude removed the mouse from our room. Unfortunately, the mouse did not have a Hollywood ending since the trap was laced with poison.

Not only was this extremely unpleasant, but everyone at the Hotel was obviously well aware of the ongoing mice problem. It was as if their motto should have been ""Mice happens"".

Anyways they offered nothing in light of the fact of what just happened .... No discount... No room switch...Yeah

We didn't make a big deal considering the mouse got the bitter end.

Other than location, the hotel doesn't have much to offer. So thanks but no thanks.",2013-08-24T03:40:09Z,99
1336,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"After reading many of the reviews here, I was a little concerned about staying at Hotel Sylvia, but we had a great experience! 
The staff at the hotel was friendly and helpful during our check-in and check-out processes, and also when we asked for suggestions on dinner.
Our room was very clean, and the bedroom appeared recently updated. The bathroom did not appear as newly renovated, but it was still very clean and quite acceptable.
The biggest draw of Hotel Sylvia is that it's right on the waterfront! Great location, and lots of restaurants nearby too. Would stay here again.",2014-06-09T02:37:30Z,99
1337,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"We are currently staying two nights at Sylvia's, in their ""new"" wing, in a supposedly ""upgraded"" room.  We knew when we chose to stay here that we were choosing an historic hotel,  not a modern, 4 or 5-star establishment. However, I am very disappointed, and will not stay here again.  

We kept our reservation after seeing the room because of the West End location, and to experience the hotel overall. We had previously had drinks in the bar, and enjoyed it. 

Many low-cost amenities could be improved or added to our King room to make it a nice experience, rather than a chintzy one. The shower has a showerhead you would find in a high school locker room. The sink faucet is old, the basin is cracked and the caulk if failing.  The floor tile is a hideous design. There is just one piece of art in our room, above the love seat, otherwise the walls are bereft of character. The ceiling is a drop ceiling of the sort you would find in an office! I've never seen such a terrible choice for a hotel ceiling - I feel like I'm staying in a hospital. 

The walls are cracked in places in the corridors, and in our room, and the paint is poorly done everywhere. 

The staff are half as friendly as staff just about everywhere else we've visited in Vancouver, which simply adds insult to injury. 

Also, Vancouver has an excellent recycling program, and The Sylvia seems not to participate. There's no recycling in our room as there should be, and from the dumpsters I can see in their parking area, it appears they only recycle cardboard - very uncool. It's 2013, after all! Get with it! 

The only saving grace of this hotel is the bar, with the bubbling atmosphere even on a Sunday at 3pm. 

We would stay at the Listel Hotel again - same price as The Sylvia in the off-season, much friendlier staff, and the rooms are at least 3x as nice. The Sylvia doesn't even provide a coffee maker!",2013-02-24T22:04:14Z,99
1338,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,I love this hotel. Right on the water with an old fashioned vibe that brings me back to a more simple and quaint time. I wish their parking was more affordable... but you can't have everything.,2017-07-21T00:45:35Z,99
1339,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"Finding a place B.E. hadn't stayed was high on my list of musts while vacationing in Vancouver - and we hit it in great style with The Sylvia! This water font boutique hotel has charm oozing at all levels. It's not luxury, and doesn't have a hot tub, thus only 4 stars, but on every other level I really like this place. Our simple room was very affordable and offered a nice size room and a shower that nearly knocked my 138 lbs (yes, Seattle has put 5 more on me - grrrrr) down with its' force. 
Parking is easy, Stanley Park is right outside the door, there's a bar, great restaurants surround the area, the beds are big, there's a beach and they use real keys instead of swipe cards. I loved it.",2009-01-06T04:52:51Z,99
1340,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"During a recent stay in Vancouver for three nights in a row we would go to the Sylvia Hotel front patio with ocean side view for a drink and flatbread.  The staff was wonderful, food tasty, view and people watching spectacular!!",2016-08-25T01:49:39Z,99
1341,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"What a classic and view of the water, and lots of metered and free 2 hr parking along the side street.

A great place to drop by in the summer after biking/rollerblading, and easy access to the washroom if you enter from the parkade, you'll go unnoticed as the lobby doesn't face you.  Hang the first right, and the nice spacious washroom is right there.

Good or not, there's no bellboy service here but the staff probably would help.

Very English-like character, built in the early 1900s, mansion/heritage, so does feel cozy.  also has a restaurant/bar.  the lobby is mrore like a living room.",2012-05-02T16:06:30Z,99
1342,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"Sigh. 
I am relocating tomorrow for 2-3 years and now i has the sads. I am really going to miss living in the West End.

So here's the story...I had 3 nights I needed to be in the city but not in my old apartment. I scoured all pet friendly hotels in Vancouver for options and found myself very limited. 
I have a cat and in a city as large as Vancouver, the Sylvia was the only hotel I could find that embraced the fact that ""pets"" includes more than dogs and that my cat is well behaved enough to not have to be supervised 24/7 or kennelled when alone. They also didn't charge extra for having a pet. All of which I VERY much appreciated.

The Sylvia also has a certain charm. No, it isn't a skyscrapper (although it once was), it isn't super modern and sterile. It has quirks. Actually it reminds me a lot of my old apt building. It's got funky levelled floors, an odd staff, but at the end of the day, everyone is friendly, truthful, accommodating and honest. They don't pretend to be in the ""perfect"" place. Which is why to me, I feel best here. 

Yes, there were a few issues, but all in all, the price was right, the location ideal and the attitude to me and my family, unparalleled. 

I will miss you West End.",2012-04-01T03:39:52Z,99
1343,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"Just returned from staying here. Room was teeny tiny, the queen bed took up the entire room. Bathroom very cramped as well, although tub shower was good with high nozzle (I'm over 6 ft and that's important to me). Old feeling with strange smells that others have mentioned. The room door was really shaky and didn't feel like it was very secure. Electri outlets were at a premium and a set of them didn't work at all. WiFi was free, but slow 

They accept dogs, which is a huge plus. My 80lb dog had trouble getting comfortable in the room and since the only substantial area for her to lay down was by the door, she went on alert every time she heard something in the hall way. Neither of us slept too well as a result.

It is nice to have underground parking (for $15 plus tax). Unfortunately, the garage is not secured and someone smashed out my back window and took a small bag of dirty clothes off the floor in the car. Staff seemed pretty indifferent about this happening. I heard one other car had the same thing happen.

Location is good, but having my car prowled and paying to park there is not really cool in my book. 

The staff stepped up to help out with some unforeseen circumstances during my visit, but at the end of the day, I'm not likely to stay here again.",2011-04-19T07:07:26Z,99
1344,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"Loved this hotel. Charming old rooms. We stayed in two different rooms. First was a little small but still cute and comfortable with a great bathroom. All the rooms have fantastic bathrooms. The other room we had was huge with a couch setup and everything. Parking situation is good, right next to a lot of great attractions. Being across from the beach was awesome. Staff was all very friendly and nice. I loved that they allow dogs and are excited to have them. They have a Facebook page for doggie guests. The bar and lounge was nice and the brunch looked delicious however we didn't eat there. 

Everything was extremely clean and fresh smelling. It's the perfect location to be close to the action but not right in the middle of it. Nice to have a quiet spot to sleep and relax. Loves going to the beach everyday. You also get a fantastic sunset and sunrise everyday. Perfectly situated on The Bay. Cheap comparably and very nice.

Had several breakfasts there; omelets BB pancakes sausage good also had a nice piece of salmon and a good steak at din din. I think parking is 18 CND [Go now while the exchange rate is good.] and you WILL need parking. Trust me it is worth 18 bucks.",2017-01-03T21:34:41Z,99

1347,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"Not my favorite hotel on my trip. My mom was really excited about staying at this hotel and had done extensive research on the place prior to our stay. I know that this is one of Vancouver's staple hotels but it just really didn't do it for me.

The concierges were not helpful at all. They were all very sweet, but couldn't really tell us a whole lot. The room was ok, not really ventilated at all and TONS of bugs flew into the room all the time. It was during a heatwave, so closing the window was not really an option. 

The bathroom was also not so great. The plumbing must be really out of date because our showers kept switching to freezing cold and then back to scalding, with no in between whatsoever. 

The hotel has its charm and is in a great location, but I don't think I'd stay here again.",2009-08-02T18:42:26Z,99

1349,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"I just love this hotel and have been a guest for many years. What I love about this hotel is its LOCATION across the street from English Bay, its unpretentious quaintness, and its quiet simplicity. This old hotel has an air of history and is blanketed in ages of ivy growth. It feels as comfortable and welcoming as a heated bath towel. It's by far not the fanciest or most modern hotel in Vancouver and it doesn't offer a bunch of amenities. But for me that's part of its charm. It's clean and simple, classic and maturely elegant.

1351,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"Room was small, run down, and overpriced. The hotel management seems to have given little thought to making guests' lives convenient. For example, there is no convenient way to get a drink of water in this hotel. The only choices seem to be to drink from the bathroom sink like a barbarian, or by physically going down to the front desk and talking to someone and purchasing a bottle of water. You would think a hotel like this one would at least have a water fountain or cooler in the lobby, and a bottle in the room (even for a price). I mean seriously, how little is that to ask? What else are they busy doing? 

Location is great though.",2016-02-13T20:24:10Z,99
1352,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"This is my second time staying at The Sylvia in just over a year. It's hard to beat the location, directly across from English Bay and 1st Beach.

It's a basic hotel. Clean, comfortable beds, reasonable sized rooms. It doesn't offer much in luxuries, which is fine with me. I don't travel to stay cooped-up in a hotel room. I just need a bed to sleep in and a bathroom to get refreshed and ready for the day. The Sylvia offers that.

There are plenty of good restaurants on nearby Denman St. If you're willing to walk just a bit further (10-15min) to Robson St, there are some outstanding restaurants there that make the walk very worthwhile (see my review of Guu with Garlic!).

Overall I'm happy with The Sylvia and it will likely be my goto-home whenever I travel to Vancouver. I'm not sure about the summer though, as I don't believe it is air conditioned (both my stays have been in the fall).",2013-10-28T15:51:00Z,99

1356,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"We recently stayed one night at the Sylvia Hotel.  On a positive note, the hotel is in a wonderful location overlooking English Bay ... you are steps from the beach area and very close to Stanley Park.  Also, we enjoyed our breakfast there and the server was very attentive.  However, our room was very small and had a funky grandpa-cologne smell to it.  Granted, we reserved a small queen room, and I understand this is an old-school hotel, but I was really happy we were only staying one night.  I will say the bed was super comfortable, so that was good.  There is no air conditioning and it was quite warm when we were there, but we found a fan in the closet, so that was helpful.  The bathroom toilet area was incredibly tight, and there was not a lot of water pressure out of the tiniest shower head I have ever seen.  I would probably stay here again if in Vancouver (mainly due to the location) but I would pony up for a better room.",2019-06-24T04:19:30Z,99
1357,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"Oh Sylvia, you weren't what I wanted you to be.

When we first arrived and checked in, I hated it. It was old, but not in a charming way. Travelzoo is loaded with reviews saying how charming it is, but I did not see the charm. I love old buildings but this place just felt very sad, even though it seemed they had just repainted and refreshed some areas.  The halls were dark and dimly lit and the housekeeping cart lived in the hallway the whole time we were there. The elevators are small and dark and noisy. The wifi is terrible. The vanity under the sink was painted plywood and there was a pipe sticking out of the wall. There were decorative sconce lights on the mirror but we couldn't figure out how to turn them on. There was painted plywood covering the pipes next to the toilet. There was little to no art on the walls for added décor. There is no a/c, so you have to have the windows open, but there are no screens, so you may have bugs fly in - which is in addition to the noise that comes in from the street below. Fortunately for me, I had brought earplugs. There is no coffee in the morning, no in-room coffee either.

On the upside, it seemed clean and it was not terribly expensive (though it still seemed a bit much for what you get, or don't get). The bed was comfortable. We enjoyed being right by the beach and the park and had a decent view from our room.

The staff was hit or miss. Once we stopped to ask for a bus map at the desk. I had heard another staff member talking to another guest about it. However, the person I asked pulled out a hand drawn map of the area and highlighted two streets telling us either bus would work. This didn't seem like enough information to get us where we needed to go. On our way out I stopped at the desk again to ask if the bus had a name or number and how much would it cost.  I still had the map in my hand and the person I asked (different from the one who'd given me this map) took it and handed me a new map. It was still an hand drawn map (is there not something more official?) but it had the route names and numbers on them and was much more useful.

They do offer parking @ $15/night.

Somehow by the third and final day I guess I'd adjusted to it and it didn't seem as terrible as when we first got there. Bottom line, if you want to stay in this area but don't want to pay a ton, go for it, but it's not a luxury hotel by any means.",2013-07-15T21:11:33Z,99

1360,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"OK, it's old, and it's on the waterfront. Once we get past location, this place fades badly. The rooms are spartan, there is no air conditioning, and since the ""heat had been turned off for the summer"" even though it was rainy and in the 50s, we had to use a space heater to heat the room. The coffee maker was plugged into an extension cord that ran on top of the baseboard heater, which probably violates several building codes. The furniture was shabby and didn't look particularly clean. The bathroom was uninviting, and not particularly clean.  I would not stay here again, nor recommend this to anyone who wanted anything above youth hostel lodging.",2014-06-14T23:34:46Z,99
1361,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"The building dates back to 1912.  That is just one special feature of the boutique hotel that many tourists love.  The other? The location.  The corner building has ocean views.  The decor is being updated but it's still fairly old-school.  So you won't find flat-screen tv's or fancy appliances in the rooms.  And some of the rooms still offer a smoking environment (which is strange for Vancouver). The building is about eight floors and offers suites as well as independent rooms.  Room 801 is a corner room that is the most spacious in the hotel. It's a 180 degree view of the ocean, overlooking English Bay -- something to consider for a fireworks night.",2008-11-14T20:37:46Z,99

1363,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"I've stayed at the Sylvia several times over the last couple of decades. Always clean, and in an excellent location, next to English Bay Beach and Stanley Park. What they have lacked in amenities was compensated by reasonable rates.
However, our most recent stay was very expensive. When I booked our room, I was told that the rates were due to an event in town that was causing high occupancy. Our king bed, non-view room was nearly $300 a night!
The room was on level with the bistro's roof, which meant we kept the windows locked while out (lest someone climb in). The room was very stuffy, as well. A fan was in the closet, thankfully. 
Electrical outlets were in short supply, and the lights over the bathroom sink did not work. We had no mini-fridge, which we really could have used. The front desk gave us ice buckets, which leaked everywhere.
There was free wi-fi, but it frequently dropped.
Oh, and the elevators had ongoing mechanical problems. We wondered if they were safe...
If the room had been less expensive, I would have forgiven the lack of some basics. 
Advice to the Sylvia management: If you are going to charge 4-star prices, your amenities should be 4-star, too.",2014-08-25T03:46:41Z,99

We have been able to fit at least 5 with plenty of space to stretch our legs and make this hotel our home for the 3 days we spend there for the Bard on the Beach Shakespeare Festival. The closeness to the always busy Denman Street and Stanley Park is always a plus, not to mention of the beautiful view if you are so lucky to get a room on that side of the hotel (which we never do). The rooms themselves, price wise, are quite expensive but are worth it.",2011-08-19T00:12:07Z,99

1367,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"Just stayed here for our first night in Canada and would definitely recommend to others.

The staff were friendly and while there was no bellboy service, we had a lot of bags so they did send someone with a trolley to assist us. Personally we loved the room with its vintage charm.  It was one of the cheapest hotels we could find at short notice and you couldn't ask for a better location. The restaurant downstairs was a real hidden gem, with great food and ludicrously big 20 ounce wine glasses (maybe this is a Canadian thing, but was certainly new to us). Checkout time is 12pm which is great in itself, but the staff were also happy to extend us to 1pm at no charge, which since we were extremely jet lagged was a huge relief. Ability to open the windows was also a plus, particularly with the great views of English Bay.

There was only really one negative, in that I am heavily dependent on internet access for work.  We specifically chose a hotel with free wifi, and the wifi service was horribly unreliable. Particularly at around 10pm when I was keen to get a lot of work done, it was pretty much unusable. Seems their wireless setup can't handle peak loads. If internet access is important to you I would probably look elsewhere.",2014-06-11T00:26:11Z,99
1368,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"I stayed here for a few days in July 2012 and loved it.

The location was perfect. It was literally 2 minutes from the beach and the sunsets were stunning. I was here for a conference downtown and walked every day (about 20 minutes, no problem). 

My room was the smallest one and cheap (by Vancouver high-season standards).  It was TINY, so if you're at all claustrophobic you may want to think twice about going for the smallest room. I liked it and found it cozy. It was also clean and comfortable with everything I needed (hair dryer, ironing board, desk, wifi, TV).

The staff were friendly and professional. One night, I came in with a takeout pizza and the guy at the front desk offered me a plate and cutlery and hot sauce from the kitchen. Nice!

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars -- when you come and go you're supposed to leave your key at the front desk. I don't mind that at all, but I didn't like it when I'd come and ask for the key by room number and the staff gave it to me without checking my name. This happened about half the time, depending who was at the front desk.",2012-10-06T13:55:33Z,99

The staff was friendly and efficient. In fact, when my husband accidentally left behind an item in the room they found it and got it back to us.
Our room was comfortable, clean and spacious. The view was not the best, but it was shielded from the street noise so it turned out to be a plus for us.
We sat on the outside bar deck for their Happy Hour and enjoyed some great appetizers and local beer and wine. The view could not be beat!
All in all, a great experience for us!",2014-06-25T11:48:59Z,99
1370,THE SYLVIA HOTEL,3.4,"We celebrated Canada Day and US Independence Day with my extended family during a week-long stay at the Sylvia Hotel.  For the Sylvia, it's all about location. This place is located on a prime piece of real estate on English Bay in the West End of Vancouver. This location gives you a chance to choose between dozens and dozens of restaurants and pubs (Denman and Davie Streets), as well as an opportunity to take a stroll of any length along English Bay.  Also, Stanley Park is literally a stone's throw from the main entrance of the Sylvia too. 

Now before you make your reservation, here are the cons on this place right up front: the water pressure in your shower is terrible (emphasis added); the rooms do *not* have air conditioning (not a terrible thing given the climate, but a notable con when you consider city noise and the bizarre item below); the wifi is good some of the time, but crashes regularly; the carpets in the entire place are old and downright filthy (caveat: it's a pet friendly hotel); the service - while courtesy - is nothing to write home about (given the rate it should be better); and the rates (if you're on personal travel) are steep given these cons. 

Back to the positives: rooms are nicely sized; they offer suites, singles, and doubles; the beds are comfortable; views out of every side of the building are very good; the restaurant and bar connected to the hotel offer respectable fare at a reasonable price and an exceptionable view of sunsets over the Bay.  Heather and/or Bruce can hook you up with a good drink and good conversation. 

One bizarre review item:  I haven't been to Vancouver in at least 20+ years, so times have certainly changed, but I maybe didn't appreciate how much....the smell of pot (aka marijuana) is everywhere - even in your room if the wind blowing just right. No judgement from this traveler on whether you consider this a positive or negative. 

My bottom line: I'd return to the Sylvia.",2012-07-07T12:16:57Z,99

Got to our room and there was no view of the harbor. But that was our fault since we didn't ask for a higher level. The room we booked was for double beds. The beds were actually quite small for 2 people. The bed was quite comfy though. The room itself is kinda small and narrow. There were some wears and tears and stains around the room but no biggie.

Ok, so besides the life changing electric bidet, the room was nice and pretty spacious for being in the city.  The beds were soft and comfy and I got some good zzzzz's every night.  

The gym is a bit small, but had everything.  They also have a small pool.

It's located across from the Pinnacle Harbour front, and up the street on the same block as the Marriot Pinnacle. Of the three, it's the newest one. 

The lobby is very nice. Check in is Smooth, but not always overly friendly ( except one of the times ) the bellmen are. always attentive and helpful.

The rooms are nice, but pretty basic, not overly fancy. Very clean and no nonsense. 

We did stay in one however, that was the Hospitality suite - It's WAY larger then the others. 

It's on the same floor as the pool and gym. It has a huge dining room table, sliding doors ( out to a patio I believe ) a nice big modern kitchen, large living room ( with pull out bed ) but no separate bedroom. 

The bathroom is bigger then others and has a tub and shower. 

The pool is outdoors as is the hot tub. It's a decent size, and during the summer it's quite nice to be outside - especially at night. It's never been overly crowded. 

The ""business center"" consists of a lone computer sitting up some stairs by the doors to the street. It's rather noisy there. 

It's a decent hotel, and I would stay there again.

1383,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"I have mostly good things to say about this hotel, and the non-good thing is pretty minor:

1.  The staff is quite helpful.  By way of illustration, I could not get my computer to connect to the internet no matter what I tried.  When I called the front desk for help, I expected the usual answer of calling the internet provider.  Instead, a staff member came up to the room and showed me how to connect, and it worked for the rest of the stay.  And there were other occasions when staff was helpful.

2.  The food was actually decent. One night I ordered room service, and the sandwich and fries were excellent.  Usually you overpay for mediocre food in hotels, but not so here.

3.  The location is excellent, just down the street from the harbor and near plenty of dining, shopping, and exploring options.

4.  The rooms are good and have an excellent view of the local area.

5. If you need Starbucks coffee, there are three or four within walking distance - or more if your walking distance is greater than the norm.

The only complaint is a minor one.  The elevators require inserting a room key before operating.  Probably set up to avoid people just wandering onto the sleeping floors.  However, the keys did not always work right away and took some finagling.  But they did work, so no harm done.  Just something to keep in mind.",2019-09-18T19:29:38Z,86

The staff at the counter were very friendly and had my keys and paperwork ready when I arrived, so it only took a minute to get going. 

The room itself was nice, but a bit sparse. Not sure if they were going for the minimalist look or if they're changing decor, but there wasnt much on the walls for art and lots of empty space in the room. It was clean and comfortable though. I liked that the bathroom had the Japanese toilet seat with the warming and cleaning functions - just something you don't see every day.

Housekeeping was great too as they followed up with me as we left a bathing suit behind. Room service came and gave me a hot water kettle and open up our bottle of wine. Service all around was awesome! I'll come back and will recommend to my travel clients. Next time I hope I can get a view of the water. And white robes would be the best!

Has a small pool and hot tub on the fifth floor we had to ourselves which was nice. Great location for easy walking around! I like the floors were secured by needing hotel key to get on elevator to your floor. Safe area for walking around at night. Two thumbs up!",2019-07-12T16:12:43Z,86
1387,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"Coast Coal was a pleasant stay.  There were slippers to use during the stay and also slippers to take home if you like (what kind of accommodation is THAT?!)  The Japanese toilet was weird at first, but different.

They offered umbrellas which was handy because it was expected to rain on-off during our visit.  

The room was modern and clean.  I just hated the bed frames because if you bump into it incorrectly, it was terribly painful! The room could have been more spacious so I wouldn't bump into the frames! 

The rooms each had a refrigerator though a microwave was lacking.  We asked at the front desk and they informed us that they could microwave the food for us, which I thought was still weird, but I guess a better alternative to eating cold rice.

If you're looking for a view of Vancouver Harbor, I wouldn't book my stay here unless you are planning to pay extra for it as the regular standard rooms would not offer this view. 

Tip on PARKING:  For those traveling with a car, we did not pay their steep hotel parking fees (in the mid-$30s/day with in/out privileges as of April 2018).  We opted for 2 hour street parking for intermittent stays at the hotel (about $3-4/hr).  There is plenty of free parking beginning about 10pm-9am and there are early bird specials (no in/out privileges; about $15 from 7am-ish to 6pm-ish) nearby if you need to park your car during the day.

1388,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"Worst hotel experience from the beginning to end. Upon check in, Ryan, who said he was the manager, had a very rude and snobby demeanor when approached.  He gave us a room that was facing construction and behind the service elevator and next to the housekeeping closet. We asked him if we could switch rooms due to the construction noise and it being next to the closet/elevator and he rudely told us no and that no other room was available and all had checked in already (this was around 4pm so it was not even late, and hard to believe). I checked online and saw that the same room type we had was available to book on third party sites AND their own website. Usually if there is only one or two rooms left, the sites will note that, but this was not the case. So clearly,  there was no shortage of rooms. Upon telling him this, Ryan still refused to move us and instead told us we had to pay extra to get a different room just to be away from the construction noise.  This is bad service especially in the hospitality industry.  I have never once had an issue like this in any other hotel I've stayed in and I frequently stay at least 5 times a month in places like the Hilton,  Hyatt, Marriott, Sheraton, Fairmont, and Westin. Later he called back after we told him this and said that he had another room available. So Ryan lied to us telling us that he didn't have any other room available especially since we arrived so early close to check in time. Again he emphasized that for CAD 60 additional we can move to a different room. It gets worse when we ask for bathrobes and sandals, which we ask for at other hotels. The guy bringing up the sandals handed us unfolded robes (who knows if these were used since it looked disheveled) and black plastic slippers (not disposable ones) that clearly had multiple stains on them and dirt. Why would you give your guests used and dirty slippers? Also this is very unhygienic to provide reusable sandals. The best part has yet to come when we are to check out. They call the room at 12:00pm on the dot and when we stepped outside at 12:04pm (checkout was noon) they had the cleaning lady standing right outside.  Not sure if this is how they treat their guests who pay to stay at this hotel or maybe Ryan and his staff are just judgemental and not fond of Asians. We definitely felt harassed at this hotel. Would stay away from this place at all costs. Not worth the price, would rather pay more to stay elsewhere in the downtown area. Much better service and no headache or harassment from staff. This place is also old and dirty, stains in carpet and towels were raggedy.",2022-10-20T08:26:12Z,86
1389,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"A friend and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights on our trip to Vancouver back in mid-June and we loved it! I booked with a third party site and left a comment that it was our first time in Vancouver and if they could give us a high floor with a view, it would be awesome! I wasn't too hopeful since we were arriving at the hotel past midnight due to our late incoming flights and figured all the good rooms would have been given away. However, they were so great!! The friendly guy checking us in (I wish I remembered names now, but I don't) said they hoped we really enjoy our first time in Vancouver and had us in a room with a  great view (1911) and it was wonderful! Great view of the water, surrounding buildings, and mountains! 

The room itself was spacious! King bed, two chairs, a small fridge where we could keep water bottles and leftover food, a nice closet with two nice robes, and a decent bathroom with great FULL-sized products for less waste! The room had floor to ceiling windows that just enhanced the picturesque view! The TV was tiny compared to the size of the room, but that was our only complaint about the room.

The location is great! It's walking distance to almost anything and everything you'll want to visit in Vancouver. We walked over to Canada Place for brunch our first morning, hopped on the free shuttle to Capilano Suspension Bridge right there, got dropped off at Stanley Park on the way back and walked around there and back to the hotel with ease (longer walk, so if it's raining, maybe grab a cab). It's a few blocks to Robson street, as well. We took a cab to Gastown since it was raining the night we went out there. There are plenty of restaurants, coffeeshops, convenience stores, and even a grocery store nearby. 

Housekeeping was great. There was one day where we were gone all morning and they hadn't done the turndown service and came by while we were relaxing late afternoon (since it was pouring out), but she was very accommodating and said she would be back when we said we would be gone again. 

I used the concierge services every morning I woke up. One of the mornings, the concierge was busy and the lady at the front desk was just as helpful! We booked a day tour to Victoria Island (downtown Victoria and the Butchard gardens) through the hotel and it was so easy. The guy picked us up and dropped us off at the hotel, we paid exactly what we were told it would cost on the bus, and it met our expectations. 

We didn't use room service but ate breakfast at the restaurant one morning. It was pretty good - I ate the continental buffet and my friend made his own omelet. 

We didn't use the gym but used the outdoor hot tub/pool two of the nights we were there. To get there, you have to go through the locker rooms, took us a minute to figure that out. I wish it was on a higher floor with a view, but it was still nice, regardless. One night, three college kids were there too and one of the kids kept asking about our stay and who we talked to at the concierge and a lot of details about our room and our stay. By the end, we weren't sure if this was an employee or the owner's kid or what, but it was pretty weird. 

Overall, it was a great stay and I would highly recommend the hotel. It's not the cheapest option, but I found it cheaper than a LOT of the hotels that would be as nice as this was. I feel like any of the cheaper options had iffy reviews so I'm glad I went with this hotel - didn't pay an astronomical amount and stayed at a fabulous hotel!",2016-07-15T11:26:38Z,86
1390,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"I booked our stay through a third-party vendor and was not familiar with the APA brand. My friends and I were in town for a girl's trip, and I was in charge of the hotel accommodations. As soon as we pulled up to the hotel, I knew that I had picked a winner!

We arrived around noon and our room was not available for check in. I could tell that my friends were delighted with the hotel lobby and the level of customer service from the front desk. The front desk agent suggested that we grab lunch, then  they'd do their best to accommodate us with an early check in. Within an hour, we had keys to our room.

The room was standard, with double beds and extremely clean. There was a mini-fridge in our room, which we were able to fill yummy snacks and leftovers. My favorite feature by far was the bidet. At first, I was fearful of the fancy toilet, BUTT it turned into a very refreshing experience. I wish I had one in my house. 

As female travelers, we all felt very safe. The hotel seemed to be central to everything. During our visit, they were filming Deadpool 2, so the streets were blocked periodically. It was a minor inconvenience, but still fun to watch filming from our room.

From start to finish, this hotel was epic!",2018-01-07T07:07:49Z,86
1391,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"This is a nice enough of a place. Great location, great service.  Whenever we needed anything, they were on top of it.  The rooms are a little small, but comfortable. Great mattress and blackout curtains; better than Vegas!
The Toto washlet addition on the toilet is a nice touch.  I think I'll purchase one of those for myself.
Very friendly and helpful staff.
I thought the $44 per night parking was a little steep. That's more than the rental itself.",2019-07-26T16:53:18Z,86
1392,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"We only had one night in Vancouver.  Booked this via Hotwire, and couldn't have been more pleased.  We arrived via cruise ship on a Sunday morning.  Since our ship arrived at Ballantyne instead of Canada Place, I had worried needlessly about an expensive cab ride.  It was less than $10.  Also had no problem checking in before 10am!  We got lucky because they didn't appear to be too busy.  Maybe because it was a Sunday in May?  Anyway, we were very grateful!

  We found this hotel to be friendly, spotless and we loved that it is so green-friendly.  Thankfully, I had read on line that king rooms are upgrades here (whether you've booked through a site like Hotwire or just straight-out)...so I knew not to get uptight about it.  Our double room was just fine, and the beds were very comfortable.  

  Having never been to Vancouver before, we knew nothing about what kind of location we needed or wanted.  Worried way too much about it beforehand.  This location was GREAT.  If we had arrived via Canada Place, we could have even walked here if we wanted to.  We did indeed walk everywhere.

  TIP:  Look up the ""Tour Guys""...they do FREE walking tours.  We met up at a nearby fountain at 11am for the tour of the day, which was, in our case, a tour of Chinatown.  Awesome!   Robson Street is within easy walking distance, as is the GasTown area.  I'm sure there were many more as well, but we only had one day so we couldn't discover them all.

  If you happen to be at this nice hotel on a Sunday night as we were, be sure to check out Preston's restaurant/bar.  We had already eaten or we would have tried the food because it looked good...but we did enjoy the bar, and Sunday night was the night to do so due to great drink specials!  If you run into ridiculously expensive wine in Canada like I did, you will LOVE the Sunday night $6.00 wine special!  

  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this clean, comfortable, quiet, friendly hotel!",2013-05-28T01:50:09Z,86

FYI, you can exchange currency at the front desk if you need to. Beds: very comfortable! Toilet: strange at first but by the time we left we were convinced we needed to purchase one for our home! Location: awesome! Hotel is walking distance to most everything or bus stations for further away sites. There is a small upscale grocery mart across the street for snacks and such that we used several times during our stay. I look forward to staying here again in the future!",2018-07-01T04:49:03Z,86
1394,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"Big fan of this hotel! Clean, modern, and very friendly staff. Easy walking to public transportation and Robson Street. And more importantly, close walk to absolutely amazing ramen spots.  But that's my personal bias.

Beds were very comfortable.  Really liked the fact that there were regular sized shampoo, conditioner, and body wash instead of the teeny tiny bottles you usually get.  The bathrooms also have the Japanese toilet seats which was a small detail we really appreciated! You just don't see those small touches of luxury that often.

Getting to this hotel from the airport was reasonably via subway. Appx. 30 min ride with a 10 min relatively flat walk afterward.  Around a 10 min uber to the Amtrak station.",2017-08-20T17:11:49Z,86
1395,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"I stayed here for two nights for a work thing that was taking place in one of the meeting rooms. Coast Coal Harbour is a modern hotel owned by APA (stands for Always Pleasant Amenities). if you haven't been to Japan, APA (Always Pleasant Amenities) is a huge hotel chain there that sometimes have multiple hotels on the same block. As a result, this particular hotel has a Japanese toilet seat/bidet in every single room. Nice to have that warmth on your butt as you sit down. 

The room I stayed in was a decent size. Although I was by myself, it was more than enough for two people. The furniture was clean and modern, bed was comfy, and the TV was large (55 inch). The location is quiet during the night but still central to the action. It's just a few minutes walk to Robson Street and a stone's throw to the Coal Harbour waterfront (one block away) and a skip and a hop to Vancouver Convention Centre (probably a 5 minute minute walk).

I was also able to use the gym while I was there and it was a pretty nice facility. Free weights, a few weight machines, a couple treadmills, a couple elliptical machines and yoga balls, etc. Not bad for a hotel gym. I didn't use the pool but it looked great and there were usually people hanging out at the hot tub. 

Service was good in most cases. But I do have a few issues to point out.
- As I was there on business, the catered food that was served during breakfast and lunch was fairly mediocre. Breakfast included some yogurt, pastries, muffins, cheese and fruit. Lunch was a couple salads and sandwiches with cookies for dessert. Fairly basic. Who knows, maybe it was the event organizer that didn't pay for the better stuff.
- At first the wifi was extremely spotty and slow. Turns out there are two Coast connections. Once I switched over to the other one, it was pretty quick. But it's really confusing that they have two wifi connections even though they both had very strong signals. 
- Parking is valet only and was a total ripoff. It's about $35 to park over night with in and out privileges. 
- Lastly, poor communication between the central office booking agents and the hotel itself. My parking was supposed to be paid for by my work. When the room was booked, my employer had to send back an authorization form which had a check box for whether parking is paid on that credit card or not. My employer sent that back to the central office. When it was time for me to check out, they couldn't find anything at all so I had to pay it on my credit card and get reimbursed back at work. An extra step that was needless because they should have had the information already. This was quite disappointing.

Like I said this is a nice hotel with modern facilities. If you're just staying for leisure hopefully you don't have to park and it's great. However, be aware if you're doing business here then there might be better options.",2017-11-28T04:28:57Z,86
1396,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"Stayed a night here two weeks back with a LA Yelper for a short two day trip to the area. Since they'd just finished completing all the work on the hotel, we were able to get a great deal for a double room at $100 (less than half the usual price). What can I say - the hotel was nice, located in a good and relatively quiet part of town, was still within walking distance of awesome places like Guu, and had awesomely comfy pillows and beds. 

A few things that irked me were that the hotel was valet only at $28 a night (though you do get unlimited in/out privileges), and the water pressure in the shower was a joke (but I did appreciate the roll-in shower of the handicapped room) Also, while the whole eco-friendly thing is great and commendable, I did wonder briefly about the cleanliness of the large communal/shared bottles of shampoo and body wash (that said, they did also provide the standard tiny individual bottles). Would I stay here again? Yes, assuming I'd find another great deal like this one.",2010-05-09T05:21:44Z,86
1397,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"As we all know, booking a hotel in a distant city (sight unseen) is a daunting task and you are at the mercy of the photographer and the art director because any room can be lit to perfection, diminishing any flaws.

First of all, I booked this hotel with my partner for our vacation in Vancouver based on looks alone because I wasn't really sure where in town this was exactly.  We typically stay at these high rise ""steel and glass"" modern hotels because they ooze class and comfort at the same time.  Our flight was later in the day, so we didn't land until about 930pm.  I had mapped out the ride to the hotel and we easily found the Canada Line SkyTrain exit after clearing customs.  We paid and we were off to the hotel.  Thirty minutes later, we arrived at the Waterfront Station and we went outside to locate a cab.  Google Maps clocked the ride from the train station to the hotel as about 20 minutes so, at almost midnight, we thought this was a safer bet than walking.  Five minutes later, we pulled up to the hotel's roundabout driveway and we went to check in.  We were greeted by a very pleasant young woman who checked us in, gave us the lowdown on the hotel and sent us up to the room.  We were even given two complimentary dessert tickets with an accompanying entrée purchase in the hotel's restaurant, Preston's.  (We never made it to the restaurant but, they had awesome happy hour specials.)

One cool feature I liked about the hotel right off the bat is that your room key controls the elevator and doesn't allow access to anyone unless they have a key card.  That immediately made me feel and put me at ease.

When we got up to the 20th floor (I requested a high floor with a water view) and I was very pleased.  We had about 250 sq. ft. of living space, including the restroom.  The wall of windows gave us a wonderful (yet slightly obscured) view of the waterfront.  From our room we could see the mountains in the distance, as well as landing planes.

The room was always tidied up very nicely by the room attendant and we were always made to feel very welcome and they tried to fulfill all of our requests, including providing us with complimentary umbrellas for the rainy weather. 

This hotel was also in walking distance of a few nice little cafes, liquor stores, drug stores and a great grocery store with hot meals called Urban Fare.

Checkout was also a breeze and they even called us a taxi for our departure back to the train station.  In summation, this is a great hotel with great customer service in the heart of Coal Harbour.",2013-12-05T21:56:29Z,86
1398,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"A great place to stay if you are in Vancouver.  

We did not have a car while we were visiting Vancouver but the hotel seemed to be within easy walking distance to everything that we wanted to see/ visit.  

The hotel is about a 30 minute walk from the Aquarium, 10 minute walk to Robson, 8 minute walk to the skytrain station, 5 minute walk from Canada Place/ Olympic Cauldron.

Decor is clean and simple - very zen-ish.

Bed linens are clean, lighting is relatively bright, no icky feeling whatsover.  

We got a great deal off expedia.  Unfortunately our friend from Spain booked right from the hotel's site and paid something like $200ish/ night - significantly more than what we paid.  

This is a fantastic and budget friendly place to stay while you are in Vancouver.  We will definitely book here again if we come back!  :)",2011-02-02T18:19:14Z,86
1399,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"You gotta be kidding me. Our room was the most fabulous room I ever remember staying in! When we arrived, we were greeted by a friendly staff. Being that it was the end of October, there were plenty of rooms available. I asked if we could upgrade to a nicer room and for $30 Canadian dollars, my wish was granted! The room was on the 20th floor, was a corner room, and two of the walls were windows! What a view!!  There were two chairs with ottomans placed strategically do we could enjoy the tv and also see the gorgeous views of Vancouver around us. The amenities were ""Earth"" brand which I never heard of but found to be awesome. The king bed was so comfy and this room had tons of closet space not to mention a large bathroom which is always welcome. We didn't try the hotel restaurant because there were so many others we wanted to try in Vancouver but we did stop in and everyone was kind! My only gripe (and no stars removed for this!) was that the ""Earth"" amenities in our room were giant and the hotel refilled the bottles. I wanted to take a remembrance of this product home, but couldn't. There was a sign in the bathroom indicating that I could purchase the products from the hotel desk staff, but I would have preferred smaller amenities and fresh bottles. These could have been used for gosh knows how long. Great stay! Will definitely be back when in Vancouver!",2015-11-30T16:28:27Z,86
1400,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"Took a family trip (2 adults, 8yo, 12yo, 13yo) to Vancouver and wanted a hotel that would accept 5 people.  There were not many that would allow us to sleep 5 in a room (and we didnt want to lie).  This hotel was the highest rated/best valued one we could find.  
Hotel/Location:  It is nice located in downtown vancouver.  Not very difficult to find and right across from the harbor (perfect location if you were taking off in a sea plane).  The hotel is located a couple of blocks away from Robson.  There are a few eateries nearby including a high end deli/market across the street.  We did do the walk to Robson and down to towards the shopping area.  The hotel signage is a tad small and we would have missed it if it wasn't for gps.  I couldn't find a self park, and would have rather valet ($40ish a night) anyways due to the rain. I wasn't sure what the capacity was when we stayed but it didn't feel crowded at all.
Service:  Checkin was fairly easy and fast.  At night, the front desk did everything including valet.  So I would call in advance for your car.  We didn't utilize room service.
Room:  I believe the hotel has 20 floors and we stayed on the 19th.  There were 3 main elevators and we didn't have to wait terribly long.  You do need your key card to access the floors.  The room was a premium king  (king bed with sofa sleeper).  There sofa was in another room but was not separated by a door.  The room was comfy for us 5.  The boys were able to fit nicely on the sofa bed (pretty tight though) and the rest of us on the king.  The bathroom was nice and large and had one of those Japanese style toilets with bidet.  The shower had decent water pressure.  They utilize large bottles of lotion, shampoo, and conditioner.  Wifi was free and was of decent strength (enough to download netfilx shows).  There was also a mini fridge in the room.  We also appreciate the umbrella in the closet (you can also request extra ones from concierge).  
Amenities:  We did not utilize room service or the restaurant on site.  I visited the gym once.  Fair size.  Dumbells went up to 50lbs.  There were a few treadmills and elipiticals.  NO bench or rack for lifting.

For the value, this is a good hotel in a decent location.  Not luxurious by any means.  Good for families.",2019-01-07T04:09:08Z,86

Wifi so intermittent I had to hear my kids complain every three minutes 

Beds in non king rooms too small to sleep two people.  So a family of 4 needs to sleep on the extra couch and a cot.

Staff were friendly and lobby was nice, but for this price point it's that's not enough.

I'd much rather pay the extra and stay at the Fairmount if you need to be in this area of town.",2017-04-09T05:05:25Z,86

This hotel is adorable! It's located in downtown Vancouver, so it allowed us to walk almost everywhere that we needed/wanted to go.  The room we had offered us two beds with beautiful floor to ceiling windows.  The bathroom was unbelievably incredible!!! It had an awesome toilet which I found out was Japanese style which had heated seats and many options that a bidet could only wish to offer! There were so many settings, it was great.  I've never used a bidet before but this toilet is seriously a great one that I want in my own home one day!!! The staff was so sweet and incredibly helpful.  We brought food from home and you wouldn't believe it but the room didn't have a microwave.  The staff was sweet enough to heat up our food for us, which was perfect.  The only complaint that I have is that the beds were really itchy.  I always shower before I go to bed but whenever I tried to sleep and woke up, I'd feel terribly itchy.  I'm wondering if maybe the sheets get changed every time a new customer comes in, but I really felt like it didn't.  Other than that, the hotel was amazing!",2017-09-17T14:51:22Z,86

The PROS:  So Coast Coal Harbour Hotel is perfectly located in downtown, Vancouver making it possible to walk to some great places like the harbour, tons of restaurants, and even several parks.  The hotel also has great customer service with employees going above and beyond to create an unforgettable experience.  There's also a great heated pool and a nice gym in the hotel... Used them both and they rock!  

The CONS:  You know I tried thinking of some, but couldn't.  This hotel is a 5/5 for a reason and it's cause it rocks! Now some cons people may have it that parking is $35 per night.  This is standard in most 4 or 5 star hotels so it's just a standard and nothing to complain about. If it bothers you well get used to paying for parking.  Staying here?

The second impression was not so good either. The guy who checked us in was not that helpful. I am okay with him not upgrading us to a room with better , but when I asked him for an unbrella and direction, he just pointed me to the concierge. Well, I guess its concierge's job, but it just made me feel unwelcomed.

1407,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"Luiz at the front desk is more than helpful. Trust his recommendations! He takes the time to customize your map for you and give you real local tips, helping you avoid tourist traps and the like.

This hotel is really conveniently located and is only a 10-minute walk to the train line that goes to the airport and a 5-minute walk from the cruise terminal (if you're not confused and go the long way like I did.) It's easy to spot from the waterfront, and a nice uphill walk to nearby Robson Street and its food and entertainment, and really close to the park and bike train that goes around the city center. It's also walkable to Gastown and Chinatown (which should be avoided. Seriously, do not try to enter via East Hastings. I lived in New Orleans and have been less sketched out. The army of bums and druggies is daunting).

The rooms are HUGE! And not just because I'd just gotten off a cruise ship. The bathroom is gigantic, nice amenities offer an eco-friendly alternative (big bottles instead OR the tiny, wasteful bottles), and the bedding is very comfortable. 

The rooftop pool is nice, albeit small; it and the adjacent hot tub are well-heated, which is great for this cooler climate. The gym is surprisingly decent, with a couple of bikes, treadmills, and even a rowing machine.

Great hotel that I'd stay at again. Solid with courteous service, plenty of space, and central location earns it a 5 for usability even though it's more of a business hotel than a luxury/leisure one.",2014-08-15T15:07:21Z,86

We had an awesome room on the 18th floor. King-size bed and a spacious private balcony with an amazing view of the city. I recommend requesting a room with a balcony because it was a lovely addition to the space. 

There was plenty of room to relax, the bedding was very comfortable and clean, and the bathroom was huge! Two sinks, large vanity, soaker tub, separate water closet, and a walk-in shower. 

The only downsides that I could think of would be that the shower was a bit small, and since they don't have suites, there are no kitchenettes available and the mini fridge was, well, incredibly mini. 

Gracious employees. Great location. Less than $10 taxi ride to the hot downtown spots. There is also a 7/11 and a Panago pizza located at the ground level in case you forgot anything for your trip or need a late-night snack.

Very efficient check in process.  Once up to the room floors it is reminiscent of a boutique hotel with all the amenities of a big chain hotel.  Loved the decor, the sound proofing was fantastic.  Showers are always a big pet peeve of mine but the room has the big shower heads with great pressure and spacious bathrooms not to mention plush oversize bath towels.

They even took time to be sure the workout facilities were not an afterthought.  There is modern equipment in a bright space with several flat screen TVs.  There is a locker/shower room and two out door heated lap pools.  Pretty nice and not what I have come to expect for a Coast Hotel.

This is a new hotel (thus I have to actually do some work to list this place), in the relatively quiet corner of Coal Harbour - an obscure location if you will just a few buildings down from the Marriott's. 

It's a minimalist design. As soon as you walk in you see that it's very simple. There's a certain elegance in that. 

Jeremiah did a great job checking me in and explaining some things, and giving me an upgrade to a corner room :P. Thanks man. 

The room is a very Japanese design like some of the hotels I've stayed in over there. The room size is normal, there is a great work desk space there, the bed is not a Westin Heavenly, but is firmer, and surprisingly comfy. 

The bathroom is nice sized (towels enough for four peeps - although in one of the towels, after I got out of the shower, I found had a long hair on it ....) but everything in that room was super - with a good shower head. 

AND I got a great deal. Thanks TravelZoo not just for the deal, but also for putting this hotel on the radar for me!

My main complaint would be confusion caused by staff. When we first arrived, we were told to park across the street. It didn't seem to be part of the hotel but we did as told. Then we got to the lobby and were told, there's no hotel parking lot except valet and we should move our car because many cars get broken into in that parking lot. We would have parked valet the first time had they told us that.

Also, when checking in, the front desk asked us where we were going to dinner, what time and under what name. I asked him why he was asking. The staffer told me it was a surprise. When we got there, there was no surprise so that just came across as creepy!

Coast Coal is a eco friendly hotel that offers free wifi!  Yes!  I am not closed off from the world.  It's in a convenient location that's in walking distance to a lot of the local attractions and touristy spots.  The free shuttle to the Capialano Suspension bridge even has a stop right across the street.  

The room itself is spacious with a decent sized bathroom.  Full length glass paned windows was a whole wall so there were great views and made getting out of bed easier.  The walls are a little thin though because I could hear my neighbors flush their toilets.  At least it wasn't moaning because that would have been awkward.  

I checked out their gym and pool...didn't use them though.  Decent equipment so if you are afraid of putting on the pounds on vacation, you can get yourself a good workout here.  

Only one restaurant on site, Preston's.  I didn't eat there but passed by it every night coming back from the day.  They were always busy and I think on Saturday night, they turned into a lounge/club.  There is also a nail salon right next to Preston's so for you ladies who need to get your nails did, you know where to go.

Instead of relaxing and exploring downtown as I had planned, I had to coordinate with my events team and find another place to stay. Not fun after several hours of travel.  It was extremely inconvenient to be at a different hotel than the rest of my company.  They didn't seem to be concerned at all about turning so many people away.  

The large meeting room was not big enough to comfortably accomodate our meeting and we were crammed in there like sardines, with barely any wiggle room.  The lunch buffet was a complete cluster-it was very cramped and the lines were long.

1415,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"I booked this hotel blindly through Hotwire. The stars must have been in perfect alignment that day because I got this wonderful hotel, located in a great downtown area, centrally located to many Vancouver sites.  
The price was a steal but for the quality of the room and service I'd have been happy even if I'd paid full price.  The staff was AMAZING! Genuinely friendly-not employer enforced friendly...you know what I mean?

My only regret was not staying longer-my next trip to Vancouver I will definitely book a room at The Coast.",2012-08-30T00:49:26Z,86
1416,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,Wonderful hotel with views of the harbor and downtown Vancouver. I found a room online for $145 a night and it was a steal at that rate. The Costal is close to Robson street shops and the mall. Gastown is also walkable. The problem was finding our way back each night on foot... located halfway between Hastings and Pender on a private driveway makes it really easy to miss! (more signs guys!),2012-11-26T20:32:51Z,86
1417,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"I had a 7 night stay in a ""premium room"" on the 20th floor (room #2002). I originally booked a ""superior room"" but was given a complimentary upgrade by the hotel.

The staff at the hotel were all great, everyone seemed very friendly and genuine. Checking in was easy, they don't have a doorman there (there is normally a valet person outside), which I really preferred. I prefer to manage my own bags anyway, then you don't have to think about awkwardly tipping a doormen throughout your stay when you didn''t actually need their help. When I was checking out of the hotel one of the staff did kindly help me with wheeling one of my suitcases out though.

The location of the hotel is also good, there is a grocery store with a restaurant (Urban Fare)  that is very nearby and it is a good place to have a quick and affordable breakfast. You can walk to Stanley Park along the harbour and Robson street is a short walk up the hill if you are looking for restaurants or places to shop.

I did have a nice view towards the harbour, but the view was between two large buildings (no surprise), so when I was sitting at the desk facing the direction of the harbour my main view was of an office building, so you need to be closer to the window to see the view. Then the other windows overlooked the top of a building, which is just part of being on the 20th floor in a city like Vancouver. The hotel room was nice though, I was very happy with it. The bed was comfortable and there was a nice little area with lounges and a coffee table. The television is wall-mounted and you can angle it towards the lounge. Complimentary wifi was also provided at the hotel and that worked fine.

The bathroom was large and the bath was a really good size too. They provide plenty of towels and there are also complimentary bathrobes available in the room.

Each afternoon or early in the evening a friendly staff member delivers bottled water and little chocolates to your room (part of their turndown service, but I was normally in my room at this time). I didn't need the bottled water, and the staff member remembered this and when he knew that I preferred milk chocolate he kindly used to give me a large handful of milk chocolate each afternoon.

I thought it was really great to see a little bin for compostable food in the room, along with the usual recycling bin. One suggestion I thought of would be to stop providing bottled water with the turndown service and provide a reusable glass bottle for each guest. If a guest decides to keep the bottle there could be a small fee added when checking out. It would be better for the environment and could be more cost effective to use reusable glass bottles :-) .

---------------
Now, just a warning to those who are unfamiliar with the area, West Hastings street is nice and absolutely fine, but do not go walking through East Hastings street at any hour, it is an unsafe and really depressing part of Vancouver. I don't know whether hotels would ever give out that kind of advice to visitors, but I certainly would have appreciated knowing to avoid the other end of Hastings street.
---------------

Checking out of the hotel was easy and they were happy to store my bags for a few hours after I had checked out. There was no charge for this service and you are provided with a numbered tag for each bag that you leave with them.

Overall I was really happy with this hotel and would recommend staying if you are visiting Vancouver.",2012-10-20T22:53:54Z,86

You actually felt clean BEFORE entering the shower...I would definitely stay again under reduced rates from Hotwire (97.00  / night) plus tax.

Downtown location so there is access to a nice beachfront walk, grocery store (Urban Fare) and a restaurant attached which served a great breakfast ....full menu and the ""The Coaster"" is a great value with a serving of any choice of  juice, coffee, eggs to your preference, toast, Yukon Gold roast potatoes and choice of meat plus a fruit  salad for $15 bucks!

This hotel allows pets. I was not aware of this. I think they should let you know incase you have allergies but that wasn't my problem. Someone's annoying yappy dog was barking for awhile and keeping me awake when I was feeling like crap and trying to get some sleep. To be fair, someone was sent up as soon as I mentioned it and they somehow got the dog to shut up.

We had not says for,our friends who cam over to sit with us. Also for a room that size they should feature a TV the size which allows proper viewing from the bed, our was too small.
What was nice is that at check in you can either choose from free valet parking or breakfast.

Located in Coal Harbour, the hotel is very clean, newish, modern, environmental-friendly, and is close to everywhere.  The staff was super friendly, and accompanied my request for wanting to be on a higher floor (16th).  I had a great City view from my room.  All these for two-thirds, if not half, of what other high-end hotels in the area are charging.  My stay also came with complementary hearty breakfast at the Prestons Restaurant.

1425,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"This is a relatively new hotel, I think no more than 2 years. It's very clean which is important to me because hotels are notoriously ick so I can't deal with seeing a gross room and all. 

Anyways, the lobby and entrance are beautiful, the room was nice, Surprisingly roomy. And I liked the bathroom. It was a good size, but I suppose nothing special. 

Now, I may be kind of an oddball, but I liked the fact that the view was of an office building. You could quite literally look into a meeting. Maybe it's the exhibitionist in me, but I dig it. 

I suppose the location isn't ideal. I typically stay closer to the entertainment/shopping districts. I was in town to see a concert (A siiiiiick concert, btw) at the Vogue Theatre so we had to taxi between the hotel and theatre. 

Oh, and I thought $35 for parking was a bit much so since we were going to have to taxi back and forth either way, we parked over by Granville and saved a good $10. Is it much? No, but mehh, dollaz is dollaz right?

1427,Coast Coal Harbour Vancouver Hotel by APA,4.1,"Went here because of yelp reviews and was sorely disappointed! Starting from check in, it was slow even though we were the only ones there. The two front desk ppl were just talking and slowly walked (kept talking to each other about useless stuff) to the counter like I was bothering them. Okayyyyyyy. And charged us extra for one more person. I forgot to add a person on my final hotels.com reservations but when I tried it with one more extra person there wasn't a charge so I thought no big deal. (I know I know in fine print it says hotels may charge for extra persons, but seriously? Never had a hotel do that! )

Room was ok. Just small and basic. One major problem I had was around 9-10pm I forgot that I left my baby's pacifier in the car. Called ahead and ask valet to bring my car. When I get down, my car is not there. Instead the valet guy brings my keys and tells me to follow him. I have a bad feeling but I do it anyway. He leads me to the service elevator to the parking lot (all dark and dangerous looking) and shows me to my car. Seriously?! He wants me to squeeze thru their parking job. Literally can't open my car door even half way since all the valet cars are jammed packed. Finally able to squeeze in to find my baby's pacifier all the while the valet guy is just watching me. Um. Uncomfortable. The whole time I was thinking man if this guy attacks me and I scream, no one will hear me. I know I'm paranoid but my hubby is an worry wart! Finally climbed up some steps and back to the service elevator and back to my room. Whew!! Last time I ever stay there!

I travel a lot lately. and before they increased the rates, i stayed at the Fairmont Waterfront whcih i kinda loved. maybe cause it was a bit old school and had character... and the reward perks were nice too. 

as for the coast...it is solid. and for a downtown location close to pretty much everything, it is a great deal. especially the govt rates. BUT it is a bit cold. And the internet is kinda slow. the bathrobes and towels are kinda rough. and the alarm clock is super bright so i had to put a shirt over it to block the light (FIRST WORLD PROBLEM I KNOW!). the tv was offset to the bed and had no pivot...so i had to move my head to watch!!!!

Pros: the Gold lounge (Gold floor) is very good and the staff there are great. Love the scones!! Rather enjoyed room service. The building itself is old and beautiful and Notch8 is always good for dinner or afternoon tea. Nice luxury shops. The spa was pretty good. Pretty Xmas decor. 

Cons: yes this is an old hotel, but there is basically zero bathroom counter space, which is very disappointing. I was in a suite (953), but it was so close to the ice machine and a generally noisy area that it disturbed my sleep. The door is right by the bed. Also, there wasn't a way to cool the room down via the thermostat because since it's an old hotel, their system only allows either heating (winter) or cooling (summer). My room was 24.5C the first night and I was very uncomfortable despite it being December. Another room we booked smelled musty and was missing a knob to change the waterfall shower to the hand shower (room 931). We are used to staying at the Pac Rim, which is much more modern and has more amenities. Checked out the pool, and the hot tubs were (badly) converted into these weird little putting greens that immediately cheapened the area and looked almost like someone was playing a prank or something.

The whole building is set to ""heat"" in the winter so even if your room is too warm, there is nothing you can do about it. We were able to open our window a sliver, but that is it. My fiance and I were tossing and turning both nights we were there. It really impacted our enjoyment of our stay in Vancouver. If you can't get a good night of sleep in your hotel, what is it for? 

The staff was friendly and helpful at check-in, at the restaurant, and the valet, but the lack of sleep made our stay disappointing. 

I really wish I had more positive things to say, I really do, but our sleep was so impacted by the poor temperature design. I am not sure I would stay here again.",2024-02-20T12:13:28Z,261
1460,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"The Fairmont Hotel Vancouver is a beautiful and historic hotel (opened in 1939), and an overall great place to stay.  Location is excellent.  It's right next to the Vancouver Art Museum, and a 14 minute walk to the Vancouver Convention Center.  The staff was courteous and helpful.  

We brought our small child.  The hotel room had a minibar which triggered a room charge if anything was picked up (about $15 to $20 each item, with some $50 bottles of wine).  Again, we had a small child with us... We didn't want our toddler to buy $200 worth of minibar drinks and snacks just by picking them up.  When we asked them to remove those items from our room, they explained this results in a $50 restocking fee, which seems excessive.  They worked with us though, and we were happy with the solution.  

There was no refrigerator in the room (aside from the one full of minibar booze) for occupant use, which we missed.  It's helpful to have a fridge to stash leftovers, or milk for your child. 

The pool was nice and clean.  No hot tub; the previous hot tub was filled in and now covered with astroturf.  

Overall, it was a great hotel and we would stay there again.  It's perhaps better for people without small children though.",2023-10-28T19:13:29Z,261

The room is nice with a great view.  The best thing about this room?  The bedding!!!  The bed was so comfortable, the sheets were soft, and the pillows were just right.

1468,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Nice Heritage hotel with old style elegance.

I went to a few high teas here at the lobby restaurant. lunch buffet at Griffins, and several balls in their ballrooms.

We really enjoy the Champagne Princess High Tea, we were treated like a princess and served tea in beautiful china tea cups.

My best memory was at the Roof Restaurant when we first came to Vancouver. They used to have dinner dance there with Dal Richards and his Swing Band and at the end of dinner, they have all the waiters line up with the parade of Baked Alaska. For a little kid, that was a great memory!",2014-03-02T21:23:34Z,261
1469,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"High Tea fit for a Princess! 
I love high tea.. I usually go to Secret Garden, but I though let's go somewhere more fancy for my bestie's birthday.  I read all the reviews and it sounded wonderful.. I was very excited.  
We had a noon reservation.. Greeted and seated by a really nice women.  We were seated in a round table, with really elegant china, which I expected for high tea.  Our server came and introduced herself and explained what to expect.  I was with 2 other high tea virgins so it was really nice to have someone explain what to expect.  We were given menus,  with a list of teas to choose from and description of the food we are about to eat.  Our  three tear plate came and it looked amazing and yummy.  Our server, described everything on it and we all received our very hot loose leaf tea in a silver pots.  
Our food-- bottom plate savory petit sandwiches English cucumber and whipped Boursin on white, smoked salmon and asparagus pinwheel on rye, curried chicken walnut salad on walnut bread, hen and quail egg on sourdough 

Middle plate-- oh so sweet pastries lemon meringue tart, opera torte, mocha eclaire, raspberry tartlet, macaroons 

Top plate and the best! Warm fresh baked raisin and butter scones... Words can not express the joy those scones brought to my mouth... Yummmmmmmy! And to top it off house made jam with Devonshire clotted cream, I think I would have paid 38.00 for that combo.  

The room was pretty but a little dark for noon tea.  I love this hotel I thought it would have been better if it was in a brighter restaurant or ballroom.  Service was great we had several servers check on us and fill our tea pots with more hot water.  

The sandwiches were probably my least favorite but that's because it had to compete with yummy scones and sweets.. And tea was delish!  Over all it was a great experience great food and service. Highly recommend!",2012-10-01T02:29:20Z,261
1470,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Rain or shine, the Fairmont Hotel Afternoon tea is our must go to place when we are in Vancouver. We prefer Friday afternoon, after enjoying the variety of museums or madness shopping on Robson.

Every time I walk into this hotel, I feel like I just walked  into an old castle located in the middle of forest. Maybe its beautiful green patina roof just stands out from the concrete buildings surrounding it.

At $38.00 per person, it comes with savory ""petit"" sandwiches, fresh baked raisin & butter scones with Devonshire clotted cream. Fresh homemade blueberry preserves was so good. Sweet pastries selection were more than I could eat. But with my delicious tea, I could manage to finish it all! My choice for tea was Fairmont Lavender Earl Grey. One of the best teas I've ever tried.

Service is ALWAYS the best. It was our third year of afternoon tea and they remembered us!

So see you next year.",2012-12-05T04:03:30Z,261
1471,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"This review is for the HIGH TEA ONLY. They didn't have a choice for just that category. Downtown of course is difficult for parking as a tourist coming for only tea time.

The service was below par. The price is always high for high tea so I would expect good service. The sandwiches were overall good but I would not believe the dessert were fresh. They were almost all Coffee flavored which makes no sense to me if you are there to drink tea, you most likely are not a huge coffee feine! The tea was good but not a big selection. So I decided to try the tea iced since they suggested it. It was cool to try it that way!

The atmosphere is not ideal since the windows look out to the valet parking area instead of a nice outdoor area. It would have been better if they made this whole restaurant on a higher level so it had a view of any kind. 

I would not return here but it was good to go to another Fairmont to compare notes. They are definitely all different.",2013-10-22T19:05:51Z,261
1472,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"I was recently here for afternoon tea and was quite disapointed. Having come for tea at the Fairmont for many years, I feel as though the service and overall atmosphere of having high tea here has gone downhill. I am really hoping the new vamp up in June will give it a boost. 

During my recent afternoon tea experience, it was not very busy, however, we switched servers 3 times throughout. For one of the most expensive high tea experiences in Vancouver ($50/person), I would have expected better service. There was a lot of waiting - waited for someone to take our order, waited for refills, waited roughly 20 minutes for our bill. Our server, Darwin, no offense, was kind of terrible in terms of service and punctuality, but had a good attitude. Everyone else was lovely. At the end, a very nice server could not bear us waiting and helped us grab the bill. 

The food was wonderful per usual - I am never disapointed with the fine pastries and savory dishes for tea. 

Being a customer of Fairmont for so many years, I really hope that was just a one time experience and it will resume the good ways as before.",2016-06-02T21:53:18Z,261
1473,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"A couple years ago, I went to visit some friends in Vancouver and who were also in town at the Fairmont. I went to visit them at the Fairmont but apparently they stayed on a floor where you need the room key to get the lift up to their floor so I had to go back to the lovely lobby to wait for them.  Eventually I got up to their rooms and found them spacious and comfortable. Decor was elegant and certainly lives up to their ""Castle in the City"" reputation.

However the real star (besides the fact that the Gucci and Louis Vuitton stores were attached to the lobby) was their Labrador-Retriever Mavis  who is on the Guest Service Team!  The newest memeber of the team is Bo, who is also a Lab. 

They greet the guests and hours for walking are from 8:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday to Friday, with weekends and official holidays off.  Just phone Guest Services to book walk Mavis and they even give you a puppy pack water, healthy snacks and a plastic bag for stooping and scooping.  The only rule is that you can't give them treats.  

I think it's a nice touch to have dogs at the hotel, Vancouver is a dog friendly city and walking Mavis or Bo would be great for exploring the area around the Fairmont.",2008-08-24T20:25:20Z,261
1474,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"$50 per person for high tea. Having lived in England for an extended period of time I know that high tea is nothing but a trap. Personally I'd be happy with regular Tetleys tea and a few mcvities biscuits. But since I'm here in Canada visiting family, I figured why not splurge a bit.... Both financially and calorifically. More so the latter. 

Anyways, we started off with strawberries and cream.... In champs. Yes. Champagne. Mmmmm. Champagne. Ok... Often that we had  a vegetarian quiche and some bacon ball thingy. That was pretty decent. Now the tower of food came and I was ecstatic. Smoked salmon finger sandwiches!!!! But.... Call me spoiled or call me fatty... But I was in it for the scones and cakes. Mmmm. Chocolatey decedent MOIST mousse cake. Yes. I said moist. Deal with it!",2013-08-23T23:57:37Z,261
1475,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"The hotel was beautiful...I agree with the other reviews though, they could definitely use some new furniture. The rooms are nice, clean, and I had a decent view of downtown. Although I was supposed to over look the Art Gallery which would have been a thousand times better!! 

The lounge...the service was ok. I had a pretty good 900 West Lounge version of the Manhattan. It had liquor which seemed to be pretty scarce in my other drinks in Vancouver...let's just say most places add too much water and soda.  The drink was great I just with I could remember the name but it was expensive. I think we spent $150 (Canadian) on three cocktails and four beers. The bar was beautiful and the lighting was nice. The crowd: besides my friends consisted of business men staring at TSN (Canadian version of ESPN).",2009-03-01T00:06:24Z,261
1476,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"The Hotel Vancouver makes me remember why I love staying at Fairmonts. The Fairmont brand almost never disappoints when it comes to your experience during a stay. 

I arrived quite early that morning with the hope to check my bag so I could continue with my day in Vancouver and check in to my room later. The gentleman at the front desk told me he'd see if my room was available and it was. I was on a very recently renovated floor and loved my room. Very elegantly decorated to a more modern decor with keeping the classic structure that the Hotel Vancouver is know for. The renovations in the common areas are also stunning. 

The bathroom was small but functional and I loved the option for a rainforest or typical shower. The toiletries provided by Fairmont are outstanding and I love the light rose scent. 

Coffee maker in room with pods. Two things that I truly appreciate about Fairmont's attention to detail - first, is proper coffee mugs (too many hotels have started putting paper cups in rooms); second, they give you a kettle so you can make tea that doesn't taste like coffee!

The closet had ample space to hang as well as shelves and drawers to store things. There was also an umbrella provided in the closet for those rainy Vancouver days. 

From end to end, my 4 night stay there was excellent.",2016-12-23T20:15:49Z,261
1477,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Didn't stay here, just visited, but looks like a beautiful spot. Nice restaurant, lovely high end shops. However, was a bit disappointed that the only trace of history left on the check-in floor was sketches or renderings of the hotel. I suppose some people love the modern thing, but why do that to a gorgeous historic hotel? We almost stayed here, and this made me glad I didn't.",2016-10-25T01:33:05Z,261
1478,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,My employer had a large event here. Beautiful historic hotel with fantastic accommodations.  Staff was extremely polite.  Beds super comfortable.  Only issue was the inability to change the temperature in the room. Room service was amazing and fast.  Portions were large.,2022-10-27T19:01:32Z,261
1479,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Let me preface by saying that I have very high expectations for a flagship hotel like this one.  I've traveled a lot and have experienced the highs of Shangrilas, and lows of economy  airport hotels.

My experience did not align with the grandeur of this hotel and its history and location.

Check in was transactional at best, no authentic connection, no smiles.  He could have helped me associate my stay with my new membership, like the much friendlier person at Fairmont Jasper did today, but instead told me to go to my room and dial 1.

It's been a mild winter in Vancouver, but the room was a balmy 25 degrees.  I tried to cool it down to 18 degrees to enable a good night's sleep.  I couldn't do it.  I called the desk.  The whole building is set to ""warm mode"" meaning it does not cool down.  It can be warm or hot only.

It's 2023 and at this flagship hotel, there is no option to sleep feeling cool.  No care that all their guests are comfortable.

The front desk told me they were going to send someone up in 15 minutes with a portable air conditioner.  45 minutes later the engineer arrived without an air conditioner, wanting me to share my 'problem' with the temperature?  I just thanked him, sent him off, and we stayed elsewhere.

We will not stay there again.",2023-12-24T00:12:35Z,261
1480,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"I had a phenomenal experience at the Fairmont and several pleasant encounters with staff. A stand-out was when we asked the front desk attendant to take our picture, and without missing a beat he put up a ""be back soon"" sign and led us to a gorgeous picture-taking spot on the first floor. The building itself is beautiful and historic, and it's been kept up in a way that both preserves this beauty and makes you feel like modern royalty. I'd jump at the opportunity to stay here again the next time I'm in Vancouver.",2022-11-14T21:42:34Z,261

The iconic Fairmont Vancouver is my favorite place to stay while visiting Vancouver. Extremely well located and reasonably priced compared to Pacific Rim (more modern and recent) or other luxurious hotels. Bed and linen are always consistent from one Fairmont to another and perfect for a good night sleep. 

For those who love to shop, they have a variety of high end stores such as: Louis Vuitton, Dior, Gucci, etc. If that's not enough, Tiffany and Prada are a block away :-) 

Their restaurant Notch 8 has great drinks and I also ordered through room service which was really good. 

Staff is extremely friendly and helpful.

I must have this again! The only thing I didn't like was the tuna sashimi, but I never eat sashimi. The room had a beautiful cherry blossom theme, which I did not know anything about, which made the place so colorful. My favorite sandwich was the teriyaki mushroom one. It was just so delicious that I'm going to have to find a way to make it. I mentioned this to the server about how delicious it was and he gave me another one. The tea, the main thing, was so good. I believe it was a cherry blossom with a little sweetness. I wanted to know where I could buy it but forgot to ask. My main server was a bit aloof but warmed up a little bit later. If not for that, I would've given this place five stars. Now, I'm hooked on high tea!",2023-04-15T00:13:32Z,261

I must say it is the most architecturally beautiful and luxurious hotel I have ever seen. There is so much history that if you are interested please check it out as if I put it all here you will probably fall sound asleep. LOL I did take a few photos and spoke with a concierge at the hotel. It was very famous during the railway days that's why it was built and many celebrities from all over the world gathered there. Two photos of lovely women and their history which I think you'll find to be very interesting. I certainly did. If you go online you can see the interior bedrooms and dining rooms. Spectacular!

1485,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"This review is for the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver during mandatory quarantine.  

The Check-In:  I took Lyft to the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver, kept my receipt and checked in on the third floor for my three day mandatory quarantine.  Upon arrival, I was directed to an elevator and instructed to press the elevator close button to proceed to the third floor.  There, I was met with a friendly face - Heather.  She checked me into my room, provided me with a key and explained how I could get reimbursed for the transportation (up to $50) to the hotel.  Heather is so awesome - I happened to have a couple of email exchanges with her prior to my flight into Vancouver.  

The Room:  My room had a pleasant view toward Georgia street and the water.  The window could be opened a couple of inches so it was nice to have fresh air.  The room was equipped with a mini bar (woot woot), wine glasses, wine opener, coffee and water kettle.  There were menus and informational pamphlets on quarantine.  I would either dial 0 on the hotel phone to order my breakfast, lunch and dinner or text from my mobile.  Each call or text was always immediately answered.  I can't say enough about the warmth and customer service.  

Bedding:  The sheets.  Plush bedding.  The sheets.  I love my Frette and SFERRA sheets.  These are no different.  SO soft and comfortable.  The best part of the room.

Safety:  I felt safe at all times during my stay.  On day 2, I requested to have ""outdoor time"" at the second floor courtyard.  A friendly front desk personel escorted me from my room, down a special stairway that was clearly labelled, to the outdoor courtyard.  There is also a section for smokers on the left.  It's basically located outside the pool.

The Food:  Each meal I ordered was DELICIOUS.  Some of the best in-room dining food I've had.  
- The fresh fruit platter included pineapple, watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, raspberry and blueberries.
- Burger:  Juicy, incredibly delicious.  Loved the crunchy bun
- Steak Frites:  steak was a tad overcooked, still tasty with some lovely shishito peppers
- Breakfast:  soft scrambled eggs, pork sausages with gorgeous brown grill marks...the perfect combination of crunchy/salty/juiciness, tasty potatoes and multigrain toast
- Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings:  Crispy, dry wings fried to perfection.  Came with yummy hot sauce
- Charcuterie Platter:  Nicely grilled bagette with delightful selection of artisan cheeses and charcuterie.  I especially liked the brie and the super moist proscuitto - that's hard to find even at a fancy deli!

Check Out:  I was provided with a cocktail voucher that I couldn't use because none of the bars were open.  The hotel was so awesome and applied it against my wine purchase upon check out.  I actually received my negative COVID test results within 24 hours so instead of staying 3 days, I opted to stay 2 days.  Each staff member I encountered (via phone, email and in-person) was gracious, professional and responsive.  A bellman walked me out from my hotel room.  

By the time I walked out the hotel, the invoice with credit for my third night was already in my inbox.  The Fairmont has their safety processes down pat.  Luxury hotel that is centrally located, with amazing service and delicious food.  I definitely recommend Fairmont Hotel Vancouver!",2021-05-13T23:00:55Z,261
1486,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"This is a luxury hotel but is a bit pricy for the experience you will get. The rooms are all well equipped with luxury products but lack in renovations or upgrades such ad a smart TV. If you want netflix for your kids this is mot the place for you.


The complimentary bath products are le labo, there is free nespresso machine and pods that get refilled daily. It is fun to put on the embroidered fairmont robe, but the luxuries get boring quickly.

The amenities leave much to be desired for this price point. The dining is overpriced and not exceptional as there are many other options downtown a quick walk away that would offer a better dining experience.

The gym is lacking. There is way too many people with a really small space. Maybe 3 people can lift weights, 2 squat racks, maybe 3-4 treadmills. Expect to be waiting a long time or feeling socially anxious you need to get out quickly since theres always people hovering waiting for you to leave. The pool area is also really small, so can be crowded. This is almost holiday inn vibe for amenities

Overall, its very expensive with a subpar experience.",2022-04-03T16:33:35Z,261

1489,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,Possibly one of the BEST HOTEL EXPERIENCES I have had post-ish Covid. Seriously!

1490,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"This was our first time staying at a Fairmont. We were very excited as we have always dreamed about staying in a hotel this upscale. We came for Thanksgiving, our two night stay was nearly $700. The sad part was the state of our room. The shower caulking is moldy and needs to be replaced. The shelf in the bathroom is obviously broken and the end table has been bent in such a way that if you set something on it, it slides off. Just a shame as I'm sure this used to be a great hotel but now the little things make it feel run down. The location is great and our dining experience at Notch 8 was excellent.",2022-11-25T05:46:57Z,261
1491,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,This hotel is right across the street from the main port of Vancouver. Our room had a great view of the harbor and we saw several Cruise ships come and go.

1492,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"This is a review of the regular high tea menu and experience. I really wanted to like this place, as it was the most expensive high tea I've ever bought. Ironically, this was also probably the worst high tea I've had in Vancouver. 

Most high tea rooms I have visited are bright with lots of light and very dainty decorations. For their environment, the Fairmont decided to go a different route with a more underground library sort of feeling to their high tea room. Books adorned the shelves with dim lighting. While the atmosphere could have been pulled off, unfortunately the room was too dim and had no windows. It felt like a musty basement. Overhead lights cast harsh spotlights from above, but not over the whole table. When the waitress came with our teas, she couldn't read which was which and needed to stand in a different light for quite a while, while she figured it out. 

The entire tea set was very lacklustre compared to other (more reasonably priced) high teas in the area. I remember flavours either being bland or not meshing with one another in the savouries and sweets. The cream puff did not have enough filling and one of the dessert items for me was simply chocolate dipped strawberries. 

One thing that really stuck out to me was the payment process. Our waitress was inexperienced and left the table for like 10 minutes at a time before coming back to process payments. We were sitting there waiting for way longer than expected. 

Overall, I can't recommend this experience to anyone as there are a lot better high teas in Vancouver.",2021-10-19T07:34:30Z,261
1493,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"I checked in on Friday, Sep 8th w/ a friend and went out to a wonderful dinner @ an Italian restaurant around the corner. Upon return to the hotel, we decided on a night cap at Notch8.  We were greeted by one of the staff who, three times, asked if we were hotel guests and for our room number(s), which we provided. We were then seated at one of the high tops near the bar and almost immediately after we were seated, accosted by a rude woman who came over aggressively and questioned our ethnicity, specifically asking if we were indigenous or if we were from Bali (both random). She was clearly intoxicated and was an attendee at the legal conference being held at the hotel that evening. My issue is the Notch8 continued to serve this woman alcohol, allowed her to harass us continually and did absolutely nothing, afterwards, to make amends for the overall horrific experience. One pays a premium to stay at the Fairmont for the outstanding service and treatment of their guests. The Notch8, and therefore the Fairmont, failed miserably. I'm an All Accor member and have stayed at the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver several times. Unfortunately, this may be my last visit. If you are not of a particular persuasion, think twice about staying at this particular Fairmont. This hotel needs to do better.",2023-09-17T00:17:54Z,261

1497,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"This is a great location and it is a historic hotel right in the middle of downtown Vancouver, where you can walk everywhere. 

PROS - given how old it is, it is well maintained, clean and renovated 
- friendly housekeeping staff and operator 
- good restaurant
- shopping is a few steps away, high end designers or mall so close
- has an indoor pool
- kids loved the scavenger hunt and two resident dogs 

CONS
- Checking in - checked in on a Wednesday around 3pm and there were about 6 other groups checking in. There were 3 front desk staff but no order to how guests line up. We waited a long time in the left line, and someone else just walks up to the next available staff without waiting. The staff NEEDS to be more aware of who is next in line.! Or they need to rope off a line. I even ask a bellman if we are in the right spot and he said yes. But we got ignored and it took at least 20-30 minutes for us to get help, only because the concierge finally helped maintain order in the line. This was frustrating especially with two children. When we did get greeted, no apology at all for our wait even though i am sure she could tell we were disgruntled, and if not her then the man who looked like he was training staff would have seen our frustration. 

Pool - very old and there was no hot tub. The sauna was closed as well even though mask restrictions were lifted last week.

A/C - there is none. Was up for hours overheating and trying to cool the room on the thermostat. I woke at 1, 2 and 3am to turn the heat down but each time it read 24.5C. The next day we called and were told there's no air conditioning. This was a cool 8C day in March .. I can't imagine summer. We left the window open the second night so it was noisier.

Walls - thin .. you can hear everything.",2022-03-25T05:54:07Z,261

1499,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"This is a review of Fairmont Hotel's Afternoon Tea in Vancouver BC only:

The rain is back in Seattle and it takes me back to the whimsical Afternoon Tea we enjoyed last weekend while in Vancouver BC.

The Fairmont Hotel in Vancouver is well-known for their regularly rotating themed afternoon teas.

The theme of our afternoon tea celebrated the rain in Vancouver which they succinctly called ""Raincouver"".

Afternoon tea is a British food tradition of sitting down for an afternoon treat of tea, sandwiches, scones, and cake. Afternoon tea is served around 4 p.m. During the height of afternoon tea in the 19th century, it became fashionable with the upper classes because of the influence of Anna, the Duchess of Bedford.  Afternoon tea was never intended to replace dinner but rather to fill in the long gap between lunch and dinner at a time when dinner was served as late as 8 p.m.  Lifestyles have changed since those times and an elaborate afternoon tea is now more of a special occasion treat.

On a similar note, I was surprised to learn that the term ""High Tea"" was used more to reference the working classes who ran with a different schedule and a different budget.  High Tea is a more substantial meal taken at about six o'clock after a long hard day of manual labor and to help refuel weary bodies.  It also includes a main dish, usually hot.  It is taken sitting at a tall table, hence - allegedly - the ""High"" in High Tea.

Afternoon Tea at The Fairmont was lovely and very filling.  We had several little boxes of our little treats to take home to enjoy later.  No one rushed us so it was a very leisurely affair.

I recommend getting the Imperial Breakfast Tea or Creamy Earl Grey which we originally wanted but they had run out of it.

Our server was wonderful and it was a very warmly lit and cozy room where the tea room was located in the hotel.

By the way, this isn't just a stereotypical ladies activity.  I saw some other families and couples there.

Afternoon Tea is a bit of a splurge but it's another one of those things that is a Must-Do when in British Columbia, especially when celebrating a special occasion.",2020-03-07T00:00:24Z,261
1500,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"I was set to give this hotel a higher rating, but after dealing with the lost and found after arriving home, I have sadly had to drop the review to two stars. 
We spent two nights at the hotel, and aside from our room being noisy (AC vent vibrated with the sound of the adjacent room's AC)  things were going okay. Internet and parking not included and are not cheap. My issue with the hotel is when we arrived home and I noticed that my Athleta dress and a blue romper had been left in the closet. I immediately called the hotel who connected me with lost and found. The first woman I spoke with said that nothing had been turned in from our room. The next day, another man phoned me back from the hotel and said that the person who had cleaned our room had been with the hotel for twenty years and that nothing had been turned in. I asked if the hotel had any sort of policy for reimbursing guests and he basically said he has no way of knowing if I actually left something behind or not. Not a great response for a high end hotel.",2021-08-21T20:45:31Z,261
1501,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Review for afternoon tea at the Castle.

I had a great experience at afternoon tea at the Fairmont in Toronto, so my friend and I were eager to do the same after moving to Vancouver. We were torn between the many afternoon tea places around the city but thought to give the festive afternoon tea here a try. For an upscale restaurant (and if you're charging $65/person), what a disappointment in both aspects of food and service!

The castle room inside the restaurant was empty when we first arrived, but it took about 5 minutes for our server to have us seated and to get our teas. They were also understaffed so it was just the two of us in a room of dirty tables. Shame we couldn't sit in a more photogenic location by the shelves and were stuck by the pole. Overall, our service was extra slow, one of the plates came with a dish toppled over (that our sever didn't bother fixing) AND had a resident fruit fly on it. The food, although named whimsically, tasted old and either too sweet or too salty. I was at a loss in comparison to the experience I had in Toronto, and definitely won't be recommending this place.",2018-01-08T07:56:00Z,261
1502,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Update***
Our room was ready a little after 4pm, which essentially is balanced out by the late check-out. In addition, we were given two breakfast vouchers and a sincere apology. Much appreciated and really turned things around for us. Offering 4 stars, removing one for the unsavory experience and the noise level in the lobby.***
Arrived at the Fairmont at 2pm to see if our room was ready, which it wasn't. Check-in is at 3pm, so we were content to walk around the neighborhood and do some shopping. We returned at 330pm and were told our room was still not ready. We were offered a lower tier room (lower floor) with no additional compensation. We said we'd rather wait for the intended room, but could not be given an ETA regarding when the room would be ready. We were offered two drink tickets for our trouble. We don't drink alcohol, and we informed the attendant, but he said we could get a non-alcoholic drink. Two sodas or juices don't make up for a late room. We had to ask for late check out, since they were having us check-in late. They begrudgingly said yes. They still gave us the drink tickets and said we could use them in any restaurant on the property. We specifically asked if we could bring our small dog and the attendant said yes. We walked over to the restaurant to use our tickets as we waited and we're turned away because of our dog. I told the person at the restaurant that the hotel needed to get their policies straight and left the tickets there with them. Now we're waiting in the lobby for a room that we have no idea when it will be ready. Very passive apologies, shallow attempt to rectify the issue, and we were disrespected for trying to do exactly what they asked us to do: wait and have a drink on them. Will never be back to this shockingly noisy hotel and will strongly reconsider ever staying at any Fairmont property. I'll amend my rating based on the hotel's response.",2022-08-20T23:05:36Z,261
1503,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Very slow bar service. Bartenders are disorganized. It takes forever to get a drink. Do not go there if you can help it!

1504,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"The Fairmont is located in a great location in Vancouver near several other hotels.  If you want to park your car, you should use the lot across from the lobby and turn down.

Fairmont hotels are usually nice and this was no exception.  The design is very inviting.  The front desk service was excellent and I was in my room quickly.

The beds are super comfortable and I loved the showers in the bathroom.  It just feels luxurious.

Why not five stars?  For a start it is the parking.  If you park through the Fairmont it is $60/night--but just pay across the way for $44.  It still seem like robbery.

The other reason is the elevators.  As a start, the up and down buttons are only in between the elevators that are farthest away.  Then when you get inside, you need to put in key--but it is only on the right hand side.  The worse thing is that they are very slow--I waited over five minutes because the elevators were packed (I had to take an up elevator).

Despite that, the Fairmont is a wonderful place to stay and I will be staying there again in the future.",2018-03-05T02:34:42Z,261
1505,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"I am stunned by how poor our experience staying here has been, and I have two more nights here.

The beds are very comfort and hotel staff is friendly and helpful but I suppose it can't make up for an old structure: our first room had large pieces of paint peeling off the ceiling and no hot water. The second room was well maintained but still... no hot water. The engineer was called and we ran the shower for 10 minutes in total, and then came some warmer water, which subsequently ran cold. If I could, I'd relocate to another hotel in town since we are here for 3 more days. I hope I can get used to cold showers. 

As to the restaurant, we also had problems. I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese, but instead was presented with an omelette ""because the chef wanted to make it look nice."" After the waitress returned with the proper order, the eggs were overcooked and dry. The meal was comp'd but that's not the point. It would be nice to get eggs as ordered and well prepared. I expect no less from a hotel of this stature.",2019-03-27T05:20:17Z,261
1506,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Great iconic and historic building!

Pros: amazing location, friendly staff and nice energetic and upbeat lobby with several designer stores such as Dior and Gucci in the hotel lobby. 

The hotel is historic and has had a few renovations. If you are going to stay here , I would highly recommend the gold levels 9 and 14 (14 is the newly done heritage floor). You will have access to 9th floor lounge, this is where all the gold concierge staff is and they are wonderful. Extremely accommodation and nice , Yuvi has been wonderful for us and the wedding group. You also have access to breakfast in gold lounge as well as afternoon food bites. Overall great experience.

The ballroom is amazing for a wedding and would highly recommend. 

Cons: 
Lack of causal bar , and outdoor pool are two of my main holdbacks from this location. There is only one upscale restaurant at the hotel. The rooms on other floors are ok but the hallways could use a newer and fresher feel.",2019-08-26T17:32:18Z,261
1507,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"We stayed at the Fairmont Vancouver when we plan to have our for your anniversary trip be a weekend out of town.

If I could give you 10 stars for just how good the experience he has at the Fairmont you gonna try it at least once it's simply delightful.

When I called to confirm the appointment they remembered it was our anniversary they remembered our check in time and they were able to get us into a room early.

As it was also our anniversary VE room ended up being probably 20 to 30% bigger than we originally booked for the same price plus you get all the benefits of the Fairmont.

So this is a bit of a princess weekend for my girlfriend she wanted a red wool blanket they managed to find a red and white wool blanket and they brought it up.

Then let us know several local hotspots places within walking distance gave us a few maps and encouraged us to call the concierge lane if we needed anything.

I'm starting to feel like a spoiled child whenever stay at the Fairmont and I love it.

I think if I ever stay again I would love to have warm chocolate chip cookies and a cold picture of milk at a table in our room when we walk in.

Then by default I would also have my extra large bathrobe since I'm 6'-4"" and 240lbs, The normal 5 foot seven bathrobes come up to my knees and it's rather funny.

We were planning on getting room service but ended up being an amazing breakfast shop around the corner and the food was awesome.

We are headed out of town as we grabbed or Tim Hortons which I am a complete addict.

I must say the best Tim Hortons is the one just outside of Harrison lake there's something special about their coffee is just delicious.

Back to the Fairmont the pool was amazing everything is always so clean the staff is unbelievably polished it's just a weekend of decadence.

It's a huge old hotel (it opened in 1939) and has over 550 rooms.  It was close to the client's site plus I wanted to stay in a hotel that had rooms with some character for a change rather than a cookie cutter.  Apparently there is a ghost in the hotel of a woman in red (she didn't make herself known to me).

My room was large.  There was a mini fridge that was stocked with alcohol and pop (with a cost).  WIFI was complimentary and it was fairly speedy most of the time.  There was an iron, coffee maker, robe, etc.  I found the room was really warm and stuffy so turned the A/C to 67F, which helped.  I figured out yesterday afternoon how to open the window to let in some fresh air.

The staff were really friendly and helpful.  It is downtown so walkable to everything.  There is a restaurant/lounge downstairs and some higher end shops.

However, it's definitely been run down and although a few things are renovated, a lot of things are worn out.  Coming from two nights at the JW Marriott, this was a major downgrade. There are no waters in fridge, empty hotel mini-bar, and the toiletries look like scraps from a sale. Different random brands. Service is good and the room is very clean. Sheets aren't as soft or high quality. Another ding for the fact the thermostat locks you out from making adjustments, so I slept in a sweater and just felt cold the whole night, Very uncomfortable. 
It's a decent place if you're on a business trip looking to avoid taking Ubers and if you're not planning to be in the room.

The stairs are locked and you need an escort-weird. You have to use your room key to operate the elevators to even get to your floor-too much work....

All the Fairmonts give us free bottles of water but this one charges us?

The best part is that you only get free wifi if you are Presidents Club. They actually charge you for internet otherwise. See attached photo. Wow. Other Fairmonts give you free internet.

1515,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"We were extremely disappointed with Afternoon Tea here.  Most of the food was inedible.  It was a Canada 150 theme.  

A deep fried corn dog should not be part of an afternoon tea menu.  All the bread that was used for each sandwich was dry and chewy.  There was way too much bread altogether:  a white mini bread loaf was sliced halfway down the middle to accommodate a sandwich filling, a mini slider bun was used for another sandwich, and a marbled rye bread was used for another.  There was too much deep fried dough as well, including mini donuts and ""crispy sweet dough"" for dessert.  Barely got halfway and we were already feeling grossed out by the heaviness of the meal.  

The only thing we enjoyed were the scones.  The tea was good, however they only refill with hot water until the tea is so diluted that you're drinking hot water in the end.  At $60 per person, I would think that they could at least provide a refill of tea leaves.

The tea room was dark and isolated from the main area.  Cozy, but no natural light.

Service was good.  The server gets bonus points for offering to take a photo of us, as well as for offering to box up our leftovers without being asked.

1516,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"On August 10th, 2019, Upon checking in around 12:15 am,  I was greeted by a young women named Chloe. Whom did not offer her name, a warm greeting or even a smile as we arrived. Now this did not bother me at the time, as I was over joyed with my engagement that took place early that day. That is not what disturbed me it was the proceeding situation. 

We prepaid for our room in full, but unfortunately, we had some issues with our credit card, because of the expenses of the evening, we had offered our Visa Debt Card instead, as we have used this in the past with no issues. 

To our dismay, we were told that this was not possible, nor an acceptable way of 
payment and that even though we had a fully paid room, we would not be able to access it without a credit card. Not only was I dumfounded as we have never had an issue before, but the tone and disdain that Chloe exhibited was downright disrespectful. 

Chloe proceeded to lecture us on proper hotel procedures, policies and etiquette. Again, I not only have been traveling my whole life requiring me to stay at your hotels across the globe, but my fiancé, whom is a University Professor, and I have never had an issue paying with this method before. The conversation that came along with it was not only condescending and disrespectful, but not something I would expect to come from a 5 star establishment such as yours, or from your staff.  

Chloe then proceed to ask us if there was another payment method, I said to Chloe that my wallet was in the car we just valet, she abruptly said  that we should get it, that's when I realized that I had my credit card on my phone and could tap to pay, Chloe rolled her eyes and with a huff stated we don't have tap.

Chloe then proceeded to stand there Looking at us with a blank expression on her face and and attitude, as if waiting for us to do something to make her life easier. Sir at this point, I was no longer willing to speak to your rude and abrasive team member, I asked her if it was possible for us to pay with cash, and she had then stated that that is something that they do not do. I however, insisted at this point that Chloe go get a manger and help us. She stood there staring blankly at us again.  

My fiancé then kindly ask Chloe to put it through as Debit card instead, Her response is what really took the cake, Chloe proceed to snap back with is there even 100$ on here, I've already tried this card. He responded stating that it was a Visa Debt and that if she puts it though as a debt it will work.



She did not offer us any solutions, nor advice, and was not accommodating in the least.Chloe also said that we could not access our room as it was policy. At this point I re asked Chloe to speak to a manger, she stood there staring at me fore a few more seconds before storming off , upon her return the manager okayed a debit transaction and left. 

Not only had I been treated like a child but we were also shown the least bit of hospitality. By such a rude, abrasive and down right un helpful staff member on your team, I find it hard to believe that such a fine establishment such as yours would let a guest feel less than at home whilst visiting you're  establishment. It was my engagement night and I was near tears from anger and frustration, and not only had this been noted in our file that we would be coming in late because of the celebration, but that shouldn't matter for your staff to treat guests with respect and accommodation. 


Our shower was broken. Climate control was broken. Toilet didn't flush very well and the walls were paper thin. As not only do I know how often our neighbours were doing it. But their names as well. It was awful and over priced!!",2019-08-17T07:26:14Z,261

The restaurant/bar downstairs has live piano music in the evenings and perfect Canadian comfort and charm.  Front desk personnel were very, very informative and helpful.

The pool was not available during our stay, but they gave us two other options around the area if we wanted a swim.

1519,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"As much as I wanted to give this hotel more stars, we had horrible experiences for the 4 nights we stayed there. This 1 star only because of the location. 

1. BROKEN A/C!!
When we complained on the phone to the front desk, they offer us PORTABLE A/C. Uhm!?! HELLO!! We paid full price for this room, please give us a room with working AC! I went down to talk to the Manager on Duty ( Kate Lehman ) and she finally move us to the room accross, yet at this room the A/C still feels hot. Doesn't matter how cold you set the A/C to, its still stay at 75 / 76 F. At this point, we feel doesn't matter where they move us, the A/C will all be the same because of the central system. Or at least this is what Kate told us. 

2. BANGING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!
There were teenagers that thought it was funny to bang doors and run at around 11pm to 1am in the morning. We called security, but by the time the security went up to our floors these kids already gone. This happened TWO NIGHTS in a row!!!! We found out from Harry (the manager on that day) that they found these kids and warned the parents to keep their kids in control on the first night BUT guess what?!? It happened again the second night. 

3. CONSTRUCTION ON THE 9TH FLOOR
Yep! More banging in the middle of the day. You could hear everything clearly in the room when they working. 

We stayed in alot of different hotels around the world and this is the FIRST it ever happened. 

WE DEFINITELY WONT BE COMING BACK!!!",2019-04-25T17:27:46Z,261

1521,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Review for high tea only. We managed a last minute reservation for noon high tea on Easter Day.

Made our way up to the enclosed roof restaurant, and were promptly seated. Aside from a few minor adjustments to get our place settings adjusted so we could look out the windows, no problems.  Was quiet relaxed with no loud conversations and quiet live piano music.

Service was very prompt and very attentive, with tea coming out quickly and food following shortly afterwards.

Food was tasty, though I would have liked a few more sandwich options and maybe fewer deserts, which i found a bit too sweet.

No problem accommodating my mother's dietary restrictions at the last moment, although easier to let the chef know ahead of time if possible.

My wife had hoped for a bit more Easter decor in the restaurant. Not a huge fan of the white fabric covers on the chairs, made it a bit plain rather than high class English style. Maybe from a recent wedding that weren't removed?

The plain metal teapots (room service style) didn't fit with  the China cups and dishes. At $65 per person it was expensive, but how often do you treat yourself to a high class tea service?

My wife also had a cocktail ($13) which was had good flavour",2017-04-18T05:59:40Z,261
1522,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"One of the ways to get your culture on in Vancouver, BC is to have afternoon tea (at high noon). And what better place to have high tea than The Fairmont Hotel Vancouver? 

I made a reservation a month in advance, but upon arrival at the scheduled time my name was not on the calendar. Not a problem, since we got there at 2PM (when afternoon tea starts) they were able to seat my party.

For 36 Canadian dollars, you get a variety of petite sandwiches, scones, desserts, and your choice of tea. Yes the cost of afternoon tea is expensive, but I think it's worth splurging on if you're on vacation. You can probably find some online deals (I saw some couples with print outs of promotions). **plus this meal is SUPER filling**

The only reason the Fairmont isn't getting a 4 star rating is because the service was slow (that and they lost my reservation).

1524,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"This review is only for high tea only.

After enduring a three hour boat cruise around the Indian Arm, I was thirsty for some culture.  Fortunately,  a Yelp friend recommended having high tea while in Vancouver.  The Hotel recommended was the Fairmont Hotel which was close to Coal Harbor.

Not knowing anything of high tea, I asked the attended at the hotel where the high tea was to be served.  I was fortunate to come during a mid-seating.  Reservations are made for 2pm and 4pm and I arrived around 3:30pm.  Since it was for a party of one, I was easily accommodated.

My server provided an overview of high tea and what to expect.  I looked through their tea menu and decided on the Iced Wine tea.  This is a sweet tea similar to the iced wines sold at establishments, bars and the likes, only in tea form.  

When my sample platter arrived, I delicately picked off each morsel while slowly sipping on my Iced Wine tea.  The Curried Chicken & Walnut Salad and English Cucumber & Whipped Boursin sandwich was delicious.  The sandwiches complimented the scones and preserves and clotted cream.

While I was sipping my tea, an woman approached me and introduced herself as an etiquette consultant.   She invited me to join her table after I finished my tea.  After paying my tab I joined her table and continued to enjoy the experience of high tea.  She asked if she could interview me for her blog, which I certainly agreed too.

As for the service, I found it to be impeccable.  My server was always attentive to my needs and ensured that I had a positive high tea experience.

The decor is of the Fairmont to appears to be rustic but dignified.  The tables and chairs look like something you would find at an English lounge.  The ambiance is very mellow yet intimate for a party to have a lively discussion as my table did.

1525,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Fairmont Hotel Vancouver is so underwhelming. I had high expectations with this property as it it a Fairmont brand. It is run down. Like legit looks old. It definitely needs renovation. Can't believe this was considered a luxury property when I can find a better boutique property that is far more clean and less dusty.

Check in was alright. The people downstairs didn't seem like they enjoy their jobs. Just another day at work for them.

There were missing slippers that we had to ask for one. The toilet doesn't flush so well. Like I get that it is an old property but come on! Fix your toilet. When we came back to our room our house keeper didn't clean the toilet. Like it was still dirty like seriously? 

I am just disappointed on how we paid so much money for little or to no service. No Wi-Fi and the pool is tiny and not cleaned. There were so many used towels around. Like no one around to clean them.

Overall, I am quite disappointed with this property and I would definitely not recommend this place. Overpriced. You're pretty much just paying for the brand.",2018-06-25T00:16:52Z,261
1526,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"We came here for high tea and had a great experience. First of all, weekday high tea has no wait and really was able to take the time to enjoy the setting.

Our waitress and waiter were very friendly and seemed to be seasoned professional. They were able to provide excellent service and take the time to find out that we were there for my birthday. They even gave a special treat. 

This is a quintessential high tea place for a reason. I would recommend this for special occasion or just for the high tea experience. There are many other high tea places in town but many has retail ulterior motive. 

Overall, highly recommended for overall experience.",2017-07-03T06:33:52Z,261
1527,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"This hotel.is centrally located in downtown Vancouver surrounding the shopping and trendy restaurants. Very high end shopping within the hotel and across the street from the hotel. 

We stayed in their Gold Level floors which offers continental breakfast, afternoon tea, snacks and honor system bar. The service was exceptional, concierge was very helpful except the Clefs d'Or Concierge made me feel a bit uncomfortable. I asked about the taxes as they used to refund about 6 years ago and apparently no longer. Since I will be purchasing highers items with our US dollars being strong at the moment. He proceeded to inform me that no longer was that offered but there are outlets close by. Granted I was in my work uniform, but if you saw me leaving Louise Vuitton with several bags why would you give me directions to the outlets. 

I just chuckled, said thank you and left.",2016-08-19T19:51:59Z,261
1528,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"This hotel reminds me of the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles.  They share the old style elegance from days gone by.  The interior architecture and room design is very similar. The Biltmore was opened in 1924 and it was interesting to see that the Vancouver Hotel's construction was initiated in 1928, but was held up by the depression. It was finally completed and opened with ceremonies officiated by King George VI in 1939. 

Today, part of the Fairmont chain, the hotel is quietly elegant with all of the amenities you expect at a 4 star hotel hotel. Our room was elegantly comfortable, with in room coffee and tea set hidden in the under TV cabinet. Bed was very comfortable with 4 pillows on it and extras in the closet. Desk and chair with a comfortable arm chair with good lighting for both completed the furnishings.

The original lobby and most of the ground floor are now shops.  The new entrance and lobby are large and efficient,  if lacking in old style charm. It is fairly breezy and lacking in cozy places to hang out.  This becomes an issue if you chose to forgo paying the fee for in room Wifi.  There is free Wifi available in the lobby and ground floor restaurant/bar, Notch8. If you want to use your devices, but don't feel like a drink, the lobby is your only choice.",2015-12-05T05:04:52Z,261

It is a pretty cool building too.  Has an older hotel feel, but is also seems historical.  The ground floor has a lot of high end retail and a restaurant that is okay.  The hotel staff is all very friendly.  The concierges were very helpful in indicating where to eat, what areas were good for shopping and general neighborhoods to visit.  Overall it was a good stay.

We did order room service one day and they sent us some pretty poor food.  I would recommend not ordering room service.",2015-09-02T03:02:54Z,261
1530,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Came here for a wedding, in their Pacific Ballroom.  Maybe it's because I haven't stayed in too many classical hotels, but this thing was seriously impressive.

Parking is available here for who knows how much.  If you're here though, you probably don't care about the price.

The ballroom itself has high ceilings with large chandeliers and paneled walls.  It looked like something straight out of Disney's Beauty and the Beast.

The food was quite well prepared, including the beef.  Normally hotels suck at these dishes (they make the meat way too dry), but this was not the case today.  Of course, your results will vary as every event is different.

For dessert I had some chocolate fudge cake.  This was very well done, without being too sweet.  It came served with some berry sauce.

My only complaint is that the bathroom in the main floor smells pretty nasty.  I am not sure why.  You'd expect way better out of a 4 or 5 star hotel.  The one on the C level where the ballroom is located was fine though.",2012-03-13T08:27:30Z,261
1531,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"My most disappointing experience with Fairmont, specially Fairmont high tea.  I've had the pleasure of traveling and always enjoying my stay with the Fairmont around North America, and I have never been so mad, disappointed, and frankly, embarrassed for an experience at the Fairmont. 

On Friday November 10th, I treated my friends to the ""Tipsy"" high tea experience for the ""Game On"" event.   I should mention that I participated in high tea events with the Fairmont well over ten times, and have always recommended it as worth the money for the service and experience alone.  However, this was my first event with Hotel Vancouver and it couldn't have been any worse. 

In simplest terms, where were the wait staff for service?  I've never been to the Fairmont and had to be stuffed into a booth with our jackets?  No coat hangers or anyone to even ask to take your coat?  Here you are in a small space in the basement stuck with your winter jackets.  Our waiter did not take our order,  we had to constantly flag them down to order our tea, as well as our complimentary cocktails, there were hours at a time where we didn't see the waiter at all, and got the vibe that we'd hopefully forget about our included drinks.  The tables around us were all experiencing the same frustrating experience.  And when it came time to pay, it was also like they didn't want our money because it was impossible to get our bill.  You'd think when our bill is over $300 they'd be eager to get it in our hands, but that was not the case. 

The table was also NEVER cleared, we were kept in filth for the entire night of empty plates, cups, and tea stands.  I was flabbergasted, I couldn't believe the experience we were having.  Trying to take advantage of the game night with no room because we were stuck in the filth of our discarded food.  

Which brings us to the food... Did anyone even try the creations?  I've never had such terrible tasting food from the Fairmont.  The flavour profiles did not mix at all, we were gagging from one sandwich to the next as nothing went together, and the sandwiches themselves didn't even taste good on their own.  The desserts were terribly sweet and failed to flow as well, we left almost everything half eaten because we were all unable to stomach it.  Never have I left high tea feeling so disgusted by the food.  For weeks I have been bragging to my guests for how lovely the food was going to be, and boy was that statement ever wrong. 

I gave my included drinks to my guests as I do not drink, but yet left the Fairmont with a headache like no other, I was sick to my stomach all night from what I imagine was due to the terrible food. 

I cant bring myself to describe how truly disappointed I am with Hotel Vancouver and this terrible excuse for high tea.  Please, save your money and do not attend their events,  reviewing reviews for their high tea it clearly shows that this isn't not a one off experience but what you can expect from Hotel Vancouver's events. 

You should be ashamed and I hope you try to correct this terrible experience, as its safe to say I no longer want to frequent this location, and theirs easily better options within Vancouver.  I hope someone from the management team corrects this terrible experience.",2017-11-11T15:48:05Z,261
1532,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Review for Afternoon Tea only. 

We enjoy high tea several time a year and this was our first at the Fairmont. I saw no need to write anything about the experience, HOWEVER, the restaurant sent two text messages asking for a review. Two. Here ya go. 

Tea pots: 100% metal. The handle is covered with a slippery fabric cozy. When the metal pot is full of boiling water the pot is scalding hot with an awkward center of gravity and a slippery handle. It's a significant and foreseeable injury waiting to happen, especially of you have small hands and a light grip (like most women). 

Service: very pleasant. 

Food: stale. It's bite sized finger food. It dries out quickly. It can't be prepared hours in advance. 

Room: Quiet. Light and happy music. Nice for conversation. Looks like an after thought thrown together in a back room. Only accessible by stairs. 

Cost: $68 per person. 

Outside of ""the tea room"" the restaurant looked promising.",2017-12-14T05:24:29Z,261
1533,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"This hotel is like a home away from home. We always stay on the Gold Floor, which seems pricey, but you get so much value for this upgrade. The concierge staff led by Darren is very professional and always greet you by your last name. The lounge is like an extension of your room, and includes breakfast, afternoon tea and amazing tapas each night. A wonderful experience you must try.",2021-09-04T20:59:29Z,261

1535,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"This review is strictly for the High Tea. 

They started by serving the Summer Berry Panna Cotta, which was delicious. The texture was a little bit too heavy for my taste but still forgivable. However, the sandwich and dessert selection of the high tea was disappointing. 

With the exception of the smoked salmon and curry sandwiches, the rest are a little bit bland. For the dessert selection, their strawberry shortcake is too sweet while the rest, while good, did not have a wow factor. I would rather go Sweet Obsession or Ganache for my dessert fix. 

The highlight and only saving grace of this experience is their scones. Definitely one of the best scones I ever tasted. Paired with their clotted cream, the scones were warm, flaky, buttery mouthful of goodness. 

Their service was flawless but save yourself some $$$ and just ordered their scones to-go, which you can apparently do. You get 6 scones for $20, which is such a steal in my opinion.",2015-10-13T23:51:39Z,261
1536,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Very disappointed with these hotel. To begin with the bell desk offered no help with luggage. 
The shower was awful. Water was so hot that I had to get out of the shower and ask for help. They sent an engineer and he explained that some old part was left and was not be used because it did not control the temperature. After he left tried using the shower and the hand shower could not be held properly and the engineer came back and said a nail was sticking out. The situation was explained to the front desk and the hotel manager and they did nothing at al   Most good hotels try to make it up in some small way they did not offer anything",2019-10-04T04:08:23Z,261
1537,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"I'll admit it:  I'm quite conflicted about this hotel.  

It's not that there is anything wrong with the hotel.  It's in a beautiful historic building, the staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and the bed is super comfortable!

But when you're paying close to $400/night for a room there are some things that are frustrating:

- Check in was awful and took over 30 minutes just to get to the front of the line (and we are members of the Fairmont Presidents Club).  There were only two staff members doing check ins when we arrived and one was in training.  Why not add some additional staff?  Check out was slightly better but still quite hectic.  

- The walls were paper thin.  We could hear conversations in other rooms, in the hall way, etc.  We were near the elevator so of course that includes the ""ding"" on a regular basis.  

- I believe the hotel is still under going renovations... we were on a floor with renovations (and the sounds that goes with it) going on directly above us.  Some warning and/or a slightly discounted rate for that inconvenience would have been appreciated.  

Overall, it's not a bad hotel to stay in.  I just feel at the price point you're expecting something a little bit extra as it doesn't compare to other Fairmont hotels I've stayed in.",2017-07-18T18:45:45Z,261
1538,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"For the money, I think this hotel is good but not great.  When I spend $400/night for a hotel, I expect things to be top-notch, and while many things about this hotel are good, others were not up to par.  Details below.

Location: central and excellent for restaurants/shopping.  A few blocks from the waterfront (it'd be cooler to be on the waterfront but this location is fine).  It's also a very distinctive looking building, which makes it pretty easy to find the way back.

Rooms: The rooms are on the small side and well-appointed.  I find it so interesting how much furniture they tried to stuff into the room - 2 queen beds, a desk/chair, 2 upholstered chairs, an upholstered bench... it was pretty tight, with about 6"" between one of the chairs and a bed.  But that part is ok.  The bathroom is on the small side also.  Of course it's a historic hotel so this makes sense.

The bedding was very comfortable.  In particular the pillows were great - most hotel pillows are no good but these were super.  The climate control was simple and worked well.  The room was fairly quiet.

Unfortunately the safe didn't work until someone came to fix it.  And the shower head holder was loose so I had to hold it in my hand for the whole shower (for want of a Philips head screwdriver).  I'm sure they'd have fixed that too but I was showering at 11pm and didn't want the company.  And lastly, when we arrived we found that the pool was closed for renovations (which was not mentioned when we booked).  We have 3 kids so this is a problem.  Not to worry the doorman said, the hotel would pay to send us to a nearby Fairmont with an amazing pool.  However that one was apparently closed for renovations too (isn't that weird?), so the front desk sent us to the YMCA (paid for by the Fairmont).  The Y was ok, nicely renovated, but catered to people doing exercise mostly (in a plain rectangular pool that was quite cold), not kids, and was not very convenient (several blocks away).

When going up the elevators, they all open on the 3rd floor for no particular reason.  I'm not sure why.  I was fooled twice into getting off there, one time needing to take the stairs up to the 8th floor as the elevator would not come again - odd.

All the staff seemed super nice and helpful.

Parking was $38/night.

This is generally a nice place but for the money I suspect you could do better elsewhere.",2017-06-05T04:59:28Z,261
1539,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"The hotel staff clearly takes pride in their jobs as they are all going out of their way to make guests feel welcome. The place is immaculately clean. The room service was fast and server kind, the food was hot and freaking delicious - I mean, we didn't have the highest expectations when we ordered a medium rare steak, but it was cooked well and traveled well to our room! Great location, super close to train station. 

Docking a star because of one snafu. Unbeknownst to anyone, our shower drain was clogged and flooded the bathroom. Housekeeping came right away to clean when we called, but the individual who visited demanded answers, interrupted and put words in our mouths instead of letting us explain what happened. That said, the gentleman from engineering was very kind and got the drain cleaned without issue.",2018-07-01T20:34:44Z,261
1540,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,Five stars for this amazing five star hotel. I spent the day here with family when they spent the night in the city. Because I live in the city I never think about going to the Fairmont so it was really nice to get to see the inside of the hotel and all of its amenities. Luxurious to say the least and even though I felt out of place roaming the halls and the entire grounds of the hotel the staff was very very courteous and extremely welcoming. I definitely caught the bug to stay at the Fairmont at some point. There's so many great fairmont's that I've heard of in Canada and I hope to be a guest at one someday soon.,2018-03-25T17:07:43Z,261

Once we arrived at our room, our bellboy said heating system was not functioning properly.  This was very true and I had to request a blanket for the next night.  The shower head screw was stripped, so impossible to wash my hair unless holding it. Very difficult to handle. Sent a maintenance man to fix, and it still didn't work.  They also put a portable room heater in our room.  The room did not even supply bottled water.  Charged us for even looking at drinks in frig.  They are weighted and if you lift them up you are charged for them when checking out.  One good side was the restaurant/bar was wonderful.

1543,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Let's start off with being extra clear with what this review is for. I came here for a Christmas rooftop party event on the 15th floor so this review isn't about the hotel services nor about the rooms. It's solely regarding the dinner service here. 

I've had their buffet for several years now ever since my mom's company decided to host their Christmas parties here and while food does change slightly from year to year, a buffet is pretty much the same for me as I've got a small stomach so...one can only eat so much. The protein highlight this year though was their Blackened Ahi Tuna and Striploin. There was a cold chick pea and cauliflower salad as well which was very fragrant. 

Only comments I really have in regards to the dinner overall is that I was confused on their breads. We arrived to the venue prior to dinner and had time to mingle and grab our drinks. We noticed a tray of bread baskets in the corner of the room along with the water jugs but the waiters didn't set out the bread baskets at our tables. It wasn't until tables got called up to the buffet cue did they put down the breads. Not sure if this is their normal process but logically, if people are going to the buffet line and getting their food, who is going to eat from the bread basket? If the breads were meant as mingling appies, why weren't they put out prior to dinner service? I was just very confused by the sequence of how things are done. 

And while the setting of the table was very clean with the center piece, I remember in previous years, the waiting staff will come to your table to take away any unnecessary cups and glasses but that didn't happen this year so it was quite crowded at the table when everyone was just shoving things left and right so that our dinner and dessert plates could fit on the table. Would it have been a hassle to bring over a clean cup and then fetch the coffee pot when people asked for coffee as opposed to having empty cups on the table because people didn't want any hot beverage? I don't know. 

Overall, the buffet food was decent; it was the service that left me a little confused.",2017-12-09T20:35:23Z,261
1544,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"So pretty much there is no hot tub, if I travel to a cold city with beauty's views and mountains I would expect a hot tub.

Also the shower door is faced the wrong way so when u open the door u have to face the shower head and try to not get hit by the 70 degree water. Also you turn the head hot then cold.

1549,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"There are a few things that vegans might do that come across as needy when staying in a hotel. We always ask for a mini fridge, microwave, and a removal of down blankets and pillows. Although it's not clear to most people why we need these things, it's nice to have friendly staff who are happy to help make you comfortable. 
In case you're wondering, vegans take with them and prepare a bit of food in the room sometimes. And with down, birds are live-plucked in China 3-4 times for down before being slaughtered, so sleeping on a massive amount of feathers is like asking a vegan to sleep on a bear skin rug, lots of death and suffering involved and no one wants to think about that when they're on vacation.
So thank you, Fairmont, we love your staff.",2018-02-04T08:00:29Z,261
1550,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"I think this place has a great potential. I am just very blessed to have stayed in so many elegant hotels. This one surprised me with its age and desperate need to be renovated and updated. The pool was very disappointing. I could see the paint peeling off of the ceiling, and stains on the tiles. Gym was ok, and sauna was great. The first room I stayed at had major issues with the plumbing and water leaked all over the bathroom. And then the AC was broken, and I was baking in my room until I finally couldn't take it anymore. Finally asked them to switch me to a different room. I was in a suite, but it definitely didn't make me feel at home. Staff was very friendly, which is why I gave them 3 starts.",2019-04-15T06:59:15Z,261

But we did like the Fairmont, although we could hear our neighbors easily through some thin walls. 

We paid for a ""view"" on Expedia but when we got to check in they said there are no views at this hotel and that's the regular price (although the single queen bed is the same as the two queen bed?) something was not right there.

1555,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Being my 1st-time high tea experience, I was impressed, who isn't, when it comes to visiting this historical landmark, built in 1939--almost 75 years, now that's heritage.  And the CBC's headquarters used to be here too back in the 1970s...anyways, i digress....

You get to choose your choice of tea, so went with the Lemon Robaille, as it was described as rich in nutrients.

Then the onslaught of food---well, more like the different variety, that's what the big bucks are for this, well, not really, for $39, it's a more than fair menu:

-2 scones
-2 pieces of macaron, egg salad, tomato/pork, & turkey
-eclair with coffee cream, raspberry tart, lemon tart w/ meringue, & a chocolate sponge cake which i ran out of room for.

Really good service, as expected, from a Fairmont.

And the high ceilings, royalty dish ware, as well as the decor of tables, chairs, wall paper, carpet, sure made me feel like royalty.

Sat in the back, but prefer to be in the lounge out there by the lobby for more action ;)

1556,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"I've stayed at this hotel for an occasion this past weekend and the room they gave us was ok and big but the floor of the hotel smelled like smoke and I'm very sensitive to the smell of cigarette. I've asked them to put me In a different room but they asked me to pay more to go in a bigger room however I didn't care about going to another upgraded room. All I wanted was a room with no smell! 

My other other problem was the key that every time I left my room I had to go back to the reception desk and ask for a new card. I did this maybe 20 times in the 3 days stay I had there. I've stayed at many hotels where they always give me magnetic cards and I always place it in my pocket that there is not cell and still work. 

I really think this hotel is def not a 5 star and it's over advertise. I would never stay at this hotel again.",2019-08-28T03:21:42Z,261
1557,Fairmont Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"There's a lot to recommend the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver - certainly starting with the excellent location, close to so many attractions, restaurants, and even in walking distance to Stanley Park.  The lobby level is beautiful and modern, and the entire place is spotlessly clean.  Service is excellent, both fast and friendly.  I arrived shortly after 9am and had no problem at all checking in, even though check-in was at 3pm.

However, it's still a very old hotel.  If you're looking for modern rooms, this isn't the place.  It looks like I imagine it looked in the 70's.  There's lots of room, and the amenities are nice, but it lacks the feeling of being in a top-tier hotel room that you get in the lobby.

The new Notch8 restaurant in the lobby is fantastic.  I also tried 'Absolute Spa' in the lower lobby, which was good, but didn't have the resort spa feel of other Fairmont spas - maybe because this one wasn't run by Fairmont.

Overall a great place to stay in Vancouver, but not for those looking for a modern room.",2015-04-23T16:17:32Z,261

It's wonderful that the hotel is providing free water and not with plastic water bottles. I definitely took advantage of that! The shower was great with the rainfall head and also the wand.

The showers are really good. Rain shower-heads which are my favourite! They also provide nice comfy robes and slippers.

The beds are comfy, and the rooms a decent size.

1570,"Georgian Court Hotel, BW Premier Collection",4.0,"Stayed one night with a fantastic deal through Hotwire.  I was really impressed. My flight in was delayed 8 hours because of a blizzard and my new arrival was 4am the next day.  A quick call to the hotel and hotwire before the flight and all was fixed, they just pushed the reservation back and cancelled the first night, no fees or charges even though we shortened the stay. The hotel made sure the room was ready at 5am when we arrived even though that's well before standard check in.

Room was on the top floor facing BC Place.  Most of the view is of the stadium across the street but it was pretty at sunrise (east facing) and with the stadium lit up at night.  The hotel was very quiet, bed was comfortable with good linens, and the bathroom was fully stocked with tons of Aveda products! Wifi was free and was a fast connection. 

For being in Vancouver, with all the amazing food options, I'm ashamed to say I ordered room service for dinner that night.  But after the crazy flight, getting in at 4 and spending the whole day out enjoying the city, we were shot and wanted to stay in.  The selection wasn't amazing, standard Italian dishes.  Nothing I'd normally look forward to.  It was pretty average, not bad but also not great.  Price was about the same or maybe a bit less than other restaurants in Yaletown but definitely more boring food.  

The staff was very friendly to me.  Check in was fast but it was also dead that early.  Parking was easy and secure and the price was great IMO.  I'm used to paying 30+ per night in other cities so 19 + tax was reasonable to me. Not sure if that's standard for Vanny though.  In all the chaos of flying, we forgot to change money but the front desk offered to change a few US dollars for us so we could get sodas from the vending machine until stores opened in the morning.  They also helped us find a bank, a wireless store to get a new SIM card, and showed us how to find the Capilano Park shuttle from downtown.

All in all, the trip was an exhausting whirlwind but The Georgia Court made it more enjoyable. Just wish we had that second day we were supposed to have to enjoy the city more.  We'll come back for a proper visit and will probably stay here again.",2014-01-06T04:40:05Z,109
1571,"Georgian Court Hotel, BW Premier Collection",4.0,"As a family of four, accommodations are tough in a super vertical city like Vancouver.  Georgian Court was price wise a great compromise.  For a moderate price we received a one bedroom corner suite, with a fold out couch and a rollaway for the little one (extra fee).  We saved $70 nightly choosing this hotel over La Grande residence at Sutton Place.  If I had to do it over, I would spend the extra money, since LGR has such a better location and our second room at LGR was remodeled recently.  If I am on a budget however, Georgian Court does the job with style.  The staff are excellent.  The restaurant hours are spotty, so bring your own liquor if time matters.

I was nervous that we were going to get a room that wasn't on the same floor that we stayed the last time we were there (our first time, we got to stay on a floor that had the rooms recently renovated and we loved the new layout). Although our room was on another floor, I was happy to see that the room was renovated and just as the last time I remembered it.

Only good thing about the Georgian Court (GC) is that it's close by the stadiums and near Gas Town.
 
After a long day of traveling, we arrived at the hotel around 1 PM and had requested an early check in at the time of booking. 

Well, their computer systems were down (not their fault) which apparently made it impossible to know which rooms had been cleaned by housekeeping... At least, this is the reason they gave us as to why they were not able to check us in for over two hours. Not a good start. To make things worse, the guy took my ID and credit card, wrote down the credit card number and expiration date on a piece of paper even though we had already pre-paid on Booking.com... 

We finally got into our room around 3:30 and low and behold, construction is going on seemingly right above us (certainly sounded like it). Couldn't even hear the tv, let alone trying to sleep.

When we arrived to the room, the floors of the bathroom hadn't been cleaned. There was dried pee with a hair stuck to it on the floor in front of the toilet. 

When we went to check out, the same guy that took my credit card essentially ushered us to the elevator and said ""thanks for staying with us. Bye"", as he sent us down to the parking garage.

1592,"Georgian Court Hotel, BW Premier Collection",4.0,"I really like this hotel and I have stayed here multiple times but , I won't stay again. Parking was sold out and the place the concierge advised only had overnight parking until 6 am and wasn't available until midnight because of a concert. So, I had to park then move my car twice including waking up at 6 am to move it. Not a relaxing stay at all!! This is a big deal to force your customer to not be able to park and it being unknown until arrival! I am assuming this happens a lot and they need to offer rates with or without parking listed to prevent this.",2019-02-17T16:26:16Z,109
1593,"Georgian Court Hotel, BW Premier Collection",4.0,"Not worth the hype at all. The staff is young which isn't an issue- the issue is the way they speak to guests paying top dollar. They don't even help with luggage. The staff can make or break an experience and they just did not cut it  here. We stayed here for 4 nights and I regret it. I spent over $1000 for bare minimum service, and a tiny hotel (pictures are misleading). The bed was also average and the sheets were extremely cheap- which was surprising considering the prices. 

The day we checked in, our fee + an additional $65 was taken from my account. I thought ""wow that was fast"". Come to find out that was just  my ""temporary hold"". 

When we checked out the receipt said over $100  the price online. They could not explain why. The day we checked out, the temporary hold money was back in my account??? Two days later and they STILL haven't taken out the fee. Not sure when it's going to hit now which is SO annoying.

Please don't waste your time or money here. there are so many better places  to  stay in Vancouver.",2020-02-08T21:28:11Z,109

The only reason this didn't get a 5 stars is because every time I went down to go to the Sauna, it wasn't working. Hot tub on occasion as well.

Which means, it's safe, as safe as it can get! 

**Parking is about $23 US a night with tax 

Checking in was super easy and I love the location! Its close to everything! You can get a FREE bike rental as well! 

My room is located on the 11th floor. Walking in my room I was surprised with how clean, neat and beautiful the room was. For the price that I paid for this hotel it was sure well worth it. The bed was soft, sheets smelled clean and fresh. A big flat screen TV, a refrigerator, 2 free water bottles and the bathroom has free Aveda toiletries for you to use! 

Free to use; Yoga mat, slippers, bathrobe and umbrella, it's the little touches like this that makes this hotel very likeable. 

We walked around the Hockey Arena at night and love how peaceful and quiet it was. We felt safe walking around 11 at night. 

There's also a 24 hour gym, Spa closes at 10 PM, 24 hour business center and a restaurant that connected to the hotel. 

The restaurant is named Frankie's Italian Kitchen and Bar that closes at 10 PM. 

Room service till 10 PM, a florist at the hotel and check out time is at 12!

I would have given them 5 stars but there was some confusion on the shuttle service to the cruise ship.  The front desk wasn't providing me with much reassurance, and I felt like I was going to have to take a taxi.  The shuttle did show, much to our relief.

The hotel provides free wi-fi, free water, coffee, tea, apples, bikes, a shuttle and there's a hot tub, gym and coin operated laundry facilities. We also learned that there's a ""women's floor"" where the rooms have yoga mats, curling irons, flat irons and other goodies to make a female's stay more pleasant. Odd, but sort of cool.

It's very basic with an exorbitant price point. Ive stayed at 3 star hotels that looked much better, had better views, and with a real lobby. I booked a 3 night stay here for a double queen room. And essentially paid $900 USD, when you factor in the additional daily parking charges. This is the most expensive hotel ive ever stayed in, costing almost  double what i paid at the JW Marriott RESORT in vegas. And for what? The nicest part of the room was the bathroom (minus the mildew on the ceiling). I wasnt a fan of having to request a microwave in a 4 star hotel. I also wasnt a fan of having a fridge that barely cooled anything. I also wasnt a fan of this hotel charging me before i even arrived, despite being a ""no prepayment"" booking.

We picked this hotel for its location so we weren't expecting much as far as our room or service but the staff at the Georgian Court blew us away. Daniel, who checked us in, was very friendly and helpful, as were Ruben, Adeel (?) and another dark curly-haired boy whose name I've forgotten. They were friendly and personable even if it was 3 am and these two twenty-somethings were a bit inebriated. They went above and beyond recommending spots for us, and went so far as to mark up maps and print out directions from Google for us without hesitation.

Our room was much classier than I expected. Awesome products by Aveda, a large TV, comfy beds, and lots of space. 

We were able to walk to Robson, Granville, & Gastown without any trouble, which helped us get in extra exercise to make up for all that drinking ;)

1611,"Georgian Court Hotel, BW Premier Collection",4.0,"Recently stayed at this hotel in Vancouver based on reviews, and I was hoping to like to more than I did, but I just didn't love it (I'd say I liked it though)

First off, good locale and easy to find. They have parking underneath the hotel, which is a plus for me, since I mainly go to Vancouver for work and always have a rental car.

Check in staff was friendly, and even though I asked for a room on the Orchid floor and they didn't have one, they sent a basket of the amenities that they offer in those rooms, so that was nice.

One big problem occurred though: after I checked into my room, I found a problem in the bathroom (really don't want to get into it), so I called down to the front desk and asked to change rooms. The responded immediately and sent some chocolates as an apology, as well as the bellman to help me change rooms (so glad I hadn't started unpacking yet).

Anyway, new room was the same as the other room (minus the problem). Good size with a window facing the stadium. Bed was comfy, but room and bathroom were a little dated. Also, good shower pressure and blow dryer was powerful (always a plus in my book).

Overall, the hotel was A-OK, and I'd say 3 1/2 stars. Will I stay here again? Maybe. It's the third hotel I've stayed at in Vancouver, and right now it ranks number three on my list.",2015-04-20T04:21:22Z,109

Yale town less than 10 min walk and lots in between. Apparently it was recently redone, rooms very nice, clean and modern with high quality linens and comfortable beds.

Okay, I'm not really all that ""girly"" but I must say it was really cool to find a yoga mat, curling and flat irons, box of chocolates, feminine products, makeup and nail polish removers, and best of all, a jar of bath salts for a nice soak. Very considerate, GC!

The best part about this hotel was the service. Every single person at the front desk was super friendly and helpful. They always had recommendations for restaurants and things to do, coordinated the free shuttle or a cab, and helped us with any other questions/requests we had. For example, locating large trash bags to protect a painting from the rain on a short walk.

1620,"Georgian Court Hotel, BW Premier Collection",4.0,"Booked the hotel via hotel.com and checked in after 3 pm without any major hassles. My partner wore a Sabres t-shirt, if you really want to know what the friendly ""hassle"" was about.

We arrived at the hotel and parked in the underground parking via a gate where the staff had to ring us through with an intercom. Security is good. The elevator from parking to the lobby is easily accessible but if you want to go higher, you'll need to have your room key. The underground parking led us up to the small lobby area via the elevator where we checked in within minutes. We were given two keys, wifi password, and instructions to the room. We had an upgraded room, which was nice. The room overlooks the Roger Stadium right outside the window on the upper floor of the small hotel. The other side of the bldg overlooks other hotel or business bldgs so we had the ""better"" side.

The room is clean, simple and has all the amenities we need -- nice clean white cotton sheets, non-smelling room, flat screen t.v., small refrigerator, bathroom with toiletries, couch, table/chairs, and night stands. Pretty straight forward and standard. I found out that it is one of the small luxury hotels there are across the world. There's a magazine for small luxury hotels.

The only downside of this hotel is that the free shuttle is for business travelers, not for us. Overnight parking comes out to be about $21 each night after all the taxes. We were thinking of giving up our car rental to take their shuttle since traveling within and around the outskirts of Vancouver does not appear too difficult but that didn't pan out. 

The other downside is that they don't offer some kind of continental breakfast. It's always nice to grab a quick bite before heading out to town. Luckily, there was a coffee shop around the corner and down one block.

Also, if you are not familiar with city living, drive carefully around town bc there are a lot of one way streets and when we were here in early July 2012, there were a few small parts in the busy downtown areas where the streets were closed for a festival or construction.

Overall, the experience was nice. The room is pretty quiet even on the Friday game night across the street. Our room was made up nicely every day before we returned. I enjoyed staying here. It would be a much better experience if they had free shuttles for leisure travelers and continental breakfast. Also, they seemed to have run my credit card several times (without charging it) for the deposit after I checked in so my credit card company notified me of potentially unsolicited foreign transactions.",2012-07-16T01:08:26Z,109

I had the opportunity to stay in downtown Vancouver for 5 nights and best of all it was for work so the accommodation cost was covered. Check in time is 3:00 pm, my flight from Edmonton arrived at 1:00 pm in the afternoon, so I figured at worst once my bags were collected and the cab got me to the hotel I would have about an hour to kill before I got into a room. The front desk staff were friendly and accommodating, they pretty much bent over backwards to get me into my room as quick as they could. I went to the lounge and had a beer as I was waiting. I didn't even get one sip and the front desk clerk came over to let me know my room was ready whenever I was.

I quickly finished the beer and headed to my room, there was curling on TV, and the lounge wasn't to excited about putting it on their TV. (Definitely not a strike against the hotel as it is a privately owned lounge.) I headed up to my room, as I stepped out of the elevator I noticed a small empty chocolate box on the chair just outside of the elevators. I went into my room and found it to be very spacious, it was a king bed, a 40 inch LCD TV and a great view across the street of BC Place. The only down side at this point is that the room had a slight musty smell, you know kind of like damp drywall.

I relaxed a little, watched some curling and headed out for a walk. After dinner, and the late draw of curling, I arranged my wake up call and crawled into bed for a decent nights sleep.

The next morning (Monday), I headed to the mezzanine floor as our meetings were in the hotel. As I got into the elevator, I just happened to notice that the empty chocolate box was still there. The day was uneventful and another great night of sleep ensued.

Tuesday morning as I was heading down to another day of meetings, I checked the chair and sure enough the garbage empty chocolate box was still there. The morning meetings went well. At lunch, I headed up to my room to drop off a few things and stepped into the bathroom. I was a little surprised at the sploosh sploosh sound my feet made. The floor was completely covered in water, the counter was all wet and so was the toilet. Water was still dripping out of the ceiling vent and the pot lights in the ceiling.

I called the front desk, they said maintenance will be there right away. I couldn't wait, so I went down to the front desk, gave them my cell phone number so they could let my know what was happening with my room. I grabbed a quick lunch and back to the meetings.

We wrapped up the meetings at 4:00 pm and still hadn't heard anything from the hotel about the room. I headed to the front desk and inquired about my room. I asked the clerk about the status of room 814 and he stared blankly at me and said ""What do you mean?"" I was a little perturbed that the previous shift would not have informed the incoming shift about the issues. He quickly dissappeared into a back room and a few minutes later came out and said, ""Everything is now fixed."" I asked if I had to change rooms, He replied ""Only if you want to."" I said I would prefer not to unless I had to. I then asked if the room had been cleaned. I was expecting an answer of ""Yes"", that isn't what I got. his reply ""I sure hope so!""

I headed up the room and guess what, the toilet seat was still covered in water and the towels that had been dripped on hadn't been changed. I called down and asked for housekeeping to come clean the bathroom and get me some new towels.

They brought me one new towel and only wiped down the toilet, didn't even clean it. After I insisted on all the towels being replaced, the housekeeper replaced them. Then came back for a third trip and gave me a 3 inch x 3 inch box of chocolates (3 chocolates in the box) for my inconvenience. If you are wondering, yes the empty chocolate box was still in the chair.

I had no further contact from the hotel, no follow up to see if everything was ok, no letter from the manager apologizing for the inconvenience, and no more chocolates.

On the fourth day the empty box of chocolates finally disappeared. 

When checking out I was expecting to be asked how my stay was while checking out. Nope, this wasn't the case. I wasn't even allowed to see my bill, the clerk rattled off my charges verbally and I had to try and make sense of them and once I agreed and he had them put through on my credit card did I then get a copy of the bill.

When staying at a hotel, a room is a room. It is the staff of the hotel that makes the experience. The fact that they actually fixed the leak is the only reason I am giving them two stars.",2012-02-29T05:09:17Z,109

We were happy with the clean rooms, outstanding service, and comfortable beds. Only downfall is that the work out facility closes at 10pm.

This hotel offered free wi-fi and umbrellas for guests to use.. but parking was approx. $20/night including miscellaneous fees and taxes.

I forgot to mention that the staff at GC were very kind enough to keep our passports that we forgot in the safe for us until we came back from Vancouver Island and refused any tip for having done so! Astounding!

It was a perfect location since it is about as close as you can get to the Rogers Arena without being IN the arena itself. 

The parking was $22 after the taxes and whatnot when checking out so just be aware of that. 

The hotel itself was beautiful with a connection restaurant and bar as well as free wifi throughout the hotel. 

We were offered to stay on the 10th floor aka ""Orchid"" which is catered more to women with slightly upgraded products. 

The bathroom had Aveda products with hairspray and mouthwash as well as a blowdryer, straightener and curling iron. These were a nice touch since most hotels only offer a blowdryer at best. 

The room was a bit spendy although we had purchased a package with the NHL tickets so I wasn't sure what the 'per night' truly mounted to be but I can see it being a higher end hotel due to location.

1627,"Georgian Court Hotel, BW Premier Collection",4.0,"This hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. Double thumbs up for that. The beds were very comfortable and they had free Internet access. The location was right off Robson which is where all the shops and places to chow down are.

I was worried about parking in the area since I read reviews about cars getting broken into being common in the area. This hotel has a gated underground parking lot that made me feel much better about parking my car there. About $20 after taxes and fees. 

The only thing I would say is the air conditioner was a little nosey when it kicked on. Other then that I would definitely stay here again.",2010-09-13T15:26:17Z,109
1628,"Georgian Court Hotel, BW Premier Collection",4.0,"Bad experience but I'm partially to blame. They get 3 stars for a 2 star experience. 

I really only had 2 issues:
1. Placed in the accessible suite on the mezzanine facing an alley. The room was dated and bland. More than a few bumps and and repairs required. Definitely not 4 star.  I might not have an issue with this if I paid 100-130 but I paid more than double that and it was supposed to be a deal. 

This turns out to be my fault. I booked with Priceline and name your own price for a 4 star. They have a disclaimer that basically says you get what we have left. 

2. Hot water takes 10-15 minutes to warm up. Not acceptable if you are claiming 4 star hotel. In the end the hotel made good on this and gave us free parking for the night. They claim they don't have that issue in other rooms. 

Will I be back? Nah, we had a good experience with the Hyatt in the past. The next time I'm in van I will go to that 4 star hotel for similar money.",2014-08-25T23:32:39Z,109

It was conveniently located in the Yaletown neighborhood and was close to the stop for the hop-on-hop-off bus tours.

They brought it up to our room very quick with a smile on their face. we also ordered room service on our last night and that only took about 20 minutes. The food we ordered was actually from the place next door called Frankie's. Overall I enjoyed my time here at the Georgian Court. I loved the view, and everything about the location.",2016-12-13T20:47:39Z,109
1631,"Georgian Court Hotel, BW Premier Collection",4.0,"Upscale, comfortable hotel with complementary Wi-Fi, bottled waters and 2 pieces of chocolate every time they clean the room :).
The Gym and sauna is kind of hidden in second floor and they close at 10pm, they are not that good anyways.
One big plus is elevators require room keys to go up/down, discouraging any non guests wandering upstairs. My room looked exactly same as the picture in their website, with lots of sun coming in the morning and a nice Stadium view.

CAUTION: They do not have a laundry room, so they send you next door to Hamptons Hotel for that. Once you go up the top floor of that you will feel sorry you are not staying in Hamptons to enjoy their nice jacuzzi/gym with nice downtown view.",2010-09-05T19:01:25Z,109
1632,"Georgian Court Hotel, BW Premier Collection",4.0,"4+, minus half a star for being a fairly decent walk from gastown area.

A+++ for free WiFi.

This hotel is perfect location for events at the arena, but for other downtown locations it seems to be just a little bit of a walk, not enough to be too big a hassle.

Parking is either self park or valet or in their underground garage which appeared to be quite secure.  In order to enter you had to either have a room key or be buzzed in by the front desk.  Self park was around 16 and valet was 30 I believe.

Once parked or walk in and you are greeted by a small lobby.  After getting your room key you need to insert it in the elevator in order to access the room floors (be sure to check out the photo's of the stars who have stayed there next to the elevator).

Our room was nicely appointed, I had a double bed room which was plenty big.  Nothing extraordinary, but nice and clean.

We were going to see a hockey game and I loved the fact it was within 2 blocks of Rogers Arena.  We ended up checking in about 1 with no problems at all.  The front desk staff was very friendly.  They had a king room available and asked if we'd like that instead of the 2 queens that priceline booked.  Our room was very spacious and had a nice view of BC place.  Loved the amenities in the room and the free bottled water. 

My favorite part about the hotel was how secure it was.  You couldn't get into the parking garage without your room key or being buzzed in by the front desk.  You needed your room key to get anywhere other than the lobby.",2013-02-20T18:22:01Z,109

We arrived late at night and the staff was friendly (and funny, I love Canadians!!!) and helped get the pack n play set up for the kid. They offer complimentary water, tea, coffee. The room was clean and had the coveted Aveda products. We were on the quiet side (opposite the stadium) and had a great view of the city. My husband was annoyed with the gym. It had free weights up to 25 lbs, 3 cardio machines and cable machines. I enjoyed the hot tub and steam room. They also have bikes available for your connivence. 3hr limit on the bikes but the staff said they are not watching their clocks and if it's a beautiful day respect the time limit. Otherwise, you can enjoy the bikes longer. Sorry, no baby seat available but there is a bike shop couple blocks up. Also, there's a complimentary shuttle service but it is shared between 7, yes 7 other hotels. Overall a really great stay! Especially if your going to the stadium.",2015-05-20T22:42:50Z,109
1636,"Georgian Court Hotel, BW Premier Collection",4.0,"The Georgian Court is a surprisingly luxurious boutique hotel located in Yaletown. The king bed room is large enough to accommodate a love seat so there's plenty of space to spread out. 

The bathroom products are Aveda and the decor is upscale and comfortable. There are plenty of front desk staff to answer questions and check you in/out. The lobby space is rather limited, so it can be hard to congregate there is you're part of a larger group. Parking is very affordable at $16 (before taxes) per night and the hotel offers a unique option for women - they have an entire floor dedicated to female travelers.

The hotel is conveniently located near the Queen Elizabeth Theatre, BC Place, Heritage House tours, Chambar, and Cafe Medina (both worth dining at).",2010-06-07T22:06:52Z,109

The hotel is perfectly situated in downtown Vancouver within walking distance to just about everything. You can walk to all of the shopping that starts a half a block away or a few blocks to the art museum, China town, theater and more. 

The hotel is beautiful with clean public areas that are decorated in a very stylish modern aesthetic. The rooms are clean and very comfortable. The room we had was very much a typical hotel room, set up the same way most moderately priced hotels are. 

The staff was cheerful, friendly and professional. They guided us to some restaurants that were open late because it was late when we finally got into Vancouver and to the hotel. Check out was a breeze. They helped us get everything ready for the cruise and called us a cab. 

The room, while clean and comfortable wasn't stellar or anything to gush about. It was perfect for our needs. What is worthy of lots of praise is the location. It really is perfectly situated for seeing the sites of downtown Vancouver. The service was as good if not better than service we've received in five star hotels.",2013-07-25T14:29:50Z,109

Your goal should be to explore; you don't want to spend a lot of time in the hotel.  But the Georgian Court Hotel was a great hotel that improved out vacation.  The room was very comfortable and clean.  The bed was much more comfortable than the Ritz Carlton we stayed a week later. They also had free wifi, free bike rental (if you're lucky to grab one), and free umbrellas!!!  We also tried the hotel food and it was pretty good.  I'm traveling with a pregnant woman, so sometimes we eat wherever we are.

1642,"Georgian Court Hotel, BW Premier Collection",4.0,"We started out in a beautiful room looking out on the arena. Unfortunately, the previous occupants had drenched the room in a perfume that I'm allergic to. Why housekeeping didn't pick up on that, I don't know. The gentleman at the front desk was very gracious about switching our room, though our new one didn't have a view. As we went to our new room I saw housekeeping go into our original room with an air purifier, so at least they were proactive about fixing the issue for the next person. I wasn't extremely impressed with the room. The lighting was poor, the toilet paper was mounted so far underneath the counter that I briefly panicked wondering if there even was any, the Wi-Fi was unfathomably SLOW, and there wasn't a microwave. We ended up heating up our leftover food using two hair dryers. Not what I would expect to do in a supposed ""luxury"" hotel. Also, the parking was extremely tight. The location is fantastic but I'll probably stay somewhere with better amenities next time.",2017-11-26T06:14:12Z,109

The fitness center was not optimal: there's an ancient, unusable stair machine squeezed in there that should just go. But the toughest part was ironically the pillows. All four pillows on our bed were substantially thick, and our request for a thinner pillow went unfulfilled because all of the thinner pillows had already been requested (go figure). Interestingly, I was repeatedly admonished during and after our stay that I should have requested a thinner pillow: again, I did. The hotel just doesn't have enough. So if you're planning to stay there and, like me, can't handle sleeping with your neck bent at a significant angle, request a thinner pillow ahead of time!

The staff were great along with the facilities. The staff were super helpful in giving directions and suggestions, and always had a smile. Check in was so easy and quick too. The room was modern and clean, we really loved the Nespresso machine. The bar/restaurant was nice too...had a few reasonably priced drinks after driving in through the snowstorm. I also need to mention that their security was super on spot. You have to tap your room card to get to the parking garage and/or to the floor your room is on...for any floor at all. If you're not staying there, you're not getting to the rooms or cars period. Lastly, the location is wonderful...ten minutes of walking will get you to the bar district for some fun, some awesome shopping, or to a plethora of Chinese offerings in Vancouver's Chinatown.

1647,"Georgian Court Hotel, BW Premier Collection",4.0,"Meh, I was not impressed. After reading all the reviews on Yelp, I was eager to stay at The Georgian Court Hotel during a trip to Vancouver. Given the price point (I work for a large travel company and it still cost me over $300/night after my corporate discount), I was expecting much, much more. The front desk was incredibly cold each time I approached them and they were not helpful at all. Per previous Yelp reviews, I heard about the special Aveda baskets and asked if it would be possible to have one of them sent to my room. The first time, they said it could be arranged and they would send one right up...it never arrived. I inquired again, and the employee had no idea what I was referring to. Due to the constant mentioning of these great baskets on Yelp, I was baffled that the employee acted like I was crazy for thinking these existed. We eventually were on the same wavelength and he assured one would be sent to my room...it also never arrived. I don't know if I was just staying in the Bermuda Triangle of the hotel or what, but these baskets seemed to disappear into thin air.

Looking past the unfortunate basket incident, the rest of the stay was still lackluster. While the hotel was in a decent location and it was relatively clean, our room was incredibly small. I could have been staying at a Hampton Inn in Omaha and it probably would have looked fairly similar (with more space). I just cannot justify paying that much for such a sub-par experience. Unless you can get a room here for a shockingly low price, I would not suggest staying at The Georgian Court Hotel. I was hoping to stay at a charming boutique hotel in Vancouver and my experience was nothing close to that.",2013-12-17T01:01:35Z,109
1648,"Georgian Court Hotel, BW Premier Collection",4.0,"What a welcome hotel after a poor experience at another hotel. We were in Vancouver for 9 days and after 2 at the previous hotel, we had to check out. Checked into Georgian Court and it was lovely! We did have a small issue though. 
We called from the other hotel to make arrangements and spent a few hours repacking all our things and getting lunch before heading over to Georgian Court. When we arrived, we were told there was a problem with our reservation and the King room we had booked was not actually available and that we'd have to take a room with 2 double beds. We were set on our king bed though and we had to pay an extra $30/night to upgrade to a suite. Despite this being the hotel's fault, we received no compensation but rather had to pay more. We didn't even get a phone call once they noticed the mistake to warn us. 
However, we were pretty much over it when we saw our exec. suite, just like it looks on the website. The bed was comfy, the room was spacious and clean, and they have Aveda products. Deluxe sized in the suites :) There is a Lady's floor on the 10th floor, but we were not on that floor. I asked if I could have one of the gift baskets that come in those rooms and it was no problem! Housekeeping brought a huge basket with all your hair tools plus hairspray, pantyhose, InStyle and Vanity Fair, and other girly essentials. It was a nice treat indeed! 
It is really about the little things that a hotel does, and Georgian Court has it covered with their special touches, the robes and slippers, the complimentary umbrellas, and the service whether we needed a corkscrew or whatever, it was at our door in minutes. 
Oh and did I mention location? It's 2 blocks from the Stadium-Chinatown skytrain and International Village shopping center. If it's yucky out or you don't feel like walking, the complimentary shuttle takes you anywhere you need to go as long as it isn't busy. You can always make a reservation though.  They also offer free bicycle rental.
Oh, and they had the best fitness facilities I've seen in a hotel! A free weight set with a huge weight machine and all the basics- treadmill, elliptical and bike. Also towels, water and a TV, but I don't know what's with the TV remote, that thing is ginormous. The steam room was out of service the day we arrived, but back in business shortly.

I chose this Holiday Inn Express because it was super close to the train station from the Port of Vancouver and also a $10 ride to the airport. It took us maybe 10 minutes to walk with our luggage - just don't listen to Google when it tells you to walk through the Costco lot on a Sunday. 

Because they were sold out the night before from other cruises, we were unable to check in early (10a) but Cindy checked our luggage and we went to Gastown for the day. 

After lunch (1p), I called to see if we could check in early and they said that we could. Cindy checked us in and thanked me for being an IHG member. She informed us about breakfast times and also asked if we needed a shuttle ride to the airport, which is complimentary! Yes, we definitely need a ride to the airport. It picks up on the 20 and 40 of every hour and I would suggest showing up 3 hours prior to your international flight. 

The room was so much larger than I expected and the bed was so comfortable! The bathroom is also larger than most other hotel rooms so that is really nice to have so much space. In addition to the king bed, we had a desk and chair, a wardrobe, a larger mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, chaise lounger, and a closet. They also provide Dove shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in refillable containers to be more eco friendly and offer a white noise machine to help you sleep. 

I would definitely stay here again due to how friendly the staff is, the proximity to public transportation, proximity to the Richmond Night Market (10 min walk), and how spacious and comfortable the room is.",2022-07-21T16:20:13Z,34

Be sure to call them to make sure the shuttle is operating so your not just waiting there. Front desk easy check in and accommodated any acceptable requests that were made. The Wi-Fi internet was consistently FAST. The 2 beds were comfy and room itself was not small. The bathroom i liked the extra counter space it was Spacious and very bright. One this is they have the air vent in there so if your taking a hot shower the steam is not stuck there for a bit.  

The breakfast area was always full of people it is also due to what time you go. If you go right at open 6:30am its not as busy as the morning rush which is like 8:00-9:30am. The selection was pretty plentiful, Eggs, bacon, pancakes, cinnabuns, wrapped cookies, toast, fruit (apples, bananas), yogurt, greek yogurt, Juices (apple, orange, cranberry), Coffee, teas.

1665,Holiday Inn Express Vancouver Airport - Richmond,4.1,"My boyfriend and I needed a place to stay overnight  for our early morning flight. This hotel is located about 10 mins away from Vancouver airport so it worked out well for us. 

In order to get into the parking lot you're gonna need your key so this was difficult for us since we didn't check in yet. We parked in the entrance of the lobby since it was late and quickly checked in. 

IHG members get free parking, it's usually $10 a day. 

The room seemed newly renovated and was quite spacious. The bed was super comfy and I loved the sheets and blankets. The lighting was also convenient because of the lights on top of the bed frame, closet and above the TV. 

If you want coffee you can grab some downstairs or use the Keurig in the room.

We checked out at 4:15 in the morning and grabbed a quick bite to eat from their free breakfast area. They didn't have everything out at the time, but had a few different choices to choose from. 

If I'm in the Vancouver area again I will definitely stay here!",2019-01-04T07:57:24Z,34
1666,Holiday Inn Express Vancouver Airport - Richmond,4.1,"Nice rooms, comfortable bed.  Mini Refrig and Microwave. Breakfast area is very tiny and gets filled up fast.  Not worth going to.  Friendly staff.  Garaged/caged parking with narrow parking spots.  Older hotel.",2019-08-17T19:57:35Z,34
1667,Holiday Inn Express Vancouver Airport - Richmond,4.1,"This is an excellent hotel for what we needed, and probably for many other needs as well.

Our purpose: Overnight stay before a cruise

Location / Transportation:  It's located near the Vancouver airport and there is a free shuttle that takes you to and from the hotel.  It's located right across from a Costco for those who care.  We grabbed a cheap hot dog before leaving for the cruise.  It's a 7 minute walk to the Skytrain station, which can take you to downtown Richmond or Vancouver, plus the airport.  It's a 23 minute (1 mile) walk to Aberdeen Center, where there are lots of food choices and a mall.  You can easily get there via Skytrain or bus also.  On summer (May-Oct) weekends, there is a very vibrant night market 10 minute walk from the hotel.  There is a Chinese restaurant across the street but no other eateries within a block.  It's easy to stay here if you don't have a car.

Access to Cruise Terminal:  First, Lyft and Uber are not present here, so don't expect to be able to use it.  Three ways to go from this hotel to the cruise terminal:
1. Skytrain - 7 minute walk and take the train to the end.  ~30 minutes, probably inexpensive if you want to deal with wheeling the luggage on the sidewalks for 7 minutes.  We would do this if we didn't have lots of luggage (had to pack for cold weather).  The walk was OK and on sidewalks.
2. Shuttle - C$17 per person.  Pick up 11 am but stops at other hotels.  ~45 minutes depending on traffic
3. Fixed rate taxi the hotel can get for you - C$37 charged to the room.  ~30 minutes depending on traffic.  Time as you wish.  We did this because we had two people and the difference of C$3 was worth it.

Room: This hotel was renovated in Nov. 2017 and they did a fantastic job with the rooms.  The most important piece is there are PLENTY of outlets, USB ports etc.  Some by the comfortable desk, some by the bed, and even an extra shelf in one of the corners with a plug just to put things on to charge.  There are also plugs for HDMI to connect your favorite device to the large TV.  The room is tastefully decorated.  The bathroom has a nice large backlit mirror.  There is plenty of counter space in the bathroom to spread all your ""stuff"" out.

Bed: Bed is very comfortable!  The sheets feel great and looks high quality.  There is a space for your luggage and drawers / closet to unpack if you want.  

AC/Climate: It's the normal in room A/C and it's certainly louder than central air, but not too bad.  You can set the temperature and it has a timer mode.

Breakfast: It's your standard Holiday Inn Express fare.  Very basic but adequate for most.

Security: Elevator requires room key to activate.

Staff: Very friendly and helpful.  The night we were there (Saturday), it seems like most of the guests are pre-cruise types.

Overall, it was near perfect at a reasonable rate.",2018-05-20T15:55:16Z,34
1668,Holiday Inn Express Vancouver Airport - Richmond,4.1,"Really nice hotel; keycard protected elevators, decent view, barely any noise from the planes flying by (aka. decent soundproofing/insulation), hot breakfast, and more!

1) Security of the hotel

Basically, you're the only one (apart from everyone else on your floor) who can access it. The two keycards you get when you check in are used to ""authenticate"" yourself for entry to the garage. You also need the keycards to use the elevators (your card allows for access to YOUR floor only), and your room.

2) The view

You can see around the local area - including the airplanes landing at the airport. If you're not into that, don't worry! Close the blinds and you won't even notice.

3) HD TV

All the images posted are from a while back; all the old tube-TVs were retrofitted by the time I checked in. The TV was a Samsung, 48-inch, LED TV.

There were around 60 channels, from Shaw. The guide even had a cute little message left saying ""Enjoy your stay"" (channel 16-1).

4) Hot breakfast 

I thought that it would only be some cheap continental breakfast. There was actual food; turkey sausages, western omelettes, and every other day, bacon.

They also have an automatic pancake machine, automatic toaster, constantly refilled coffee and water dispensers. 

The staff were really friendly, they cleaned our tables and took our empty plates.

5) Parking

The parking isn't free, but if you're a rewards member, it is. The garage is decent, even has music playing inside!

6) The staff in general

The staff look happy; housekeeping says hello every day!

Overall, I'd recommend this hotel! The staff are amazing, there is free hot breakfast, secure elevators and parking garage, clean beds, goodies from Bath&Body Works (the soap, etcetera), smart alarm clocks, two phone lines, flat screen Samsung TV, and the view!

This will be my go-to hotel when I visit Vancouver again!",2016-07-25T17:31:03Z,34
1669,Holiday Inn Express Vancouver Airport - Richmond,4.1,"My parents were visiting Seattle so we decided to make our usual weekend trek up to Vancouver. They like to stay in Richmond, so usually we end up at the Holiday Inn on Cambie Road. I knew they probably didn't want to stay there again, so I ended up booking a room at the Holiday Inn Express instead. Found a deal on Hotwire here for $79 a night.

This hotel has easy access to Highway 99 into Vancouver and is across the street from a Costco. Golden Village is about a 5 minute drive away from here.

The hotel driveway in front of the lobby is small. So if you are arriving by car, you should either park on the street or leave it in the driveway just a short while and pick up your room key before moving it.

Speaking of parking, it is free to park on the street. Though since it is next to Costco, parking is limited. The hotel offers gated parking for $8 CAD per night plus taxes which ends up being over $10 CAD. There are two levels of parking and you can use the parking lot until you checkout. Your key card is your entry into the structure.

Although the hotel sits next to the highway, it was surprisingly quiet. You can't hear any noise on the highway side, but you do on the Costco side of the building. It was pouring rain and the noise from it was noticeable inside the room.

The room was comfy and it had a large LCD TV. There is free room Wi-Fi which the front counter staff gives you the code for at check-in. I liked that the room had numerous plugs available for me to charge my electronics for the night. Though the room could have used a mini fridge. The bed has numerous pillows to choose from depending on your preference of firmness.

As for the facilities here, I did check out the fitness room. It is larger than average. Not quite a full gym. There is a weight rack and a few machines. They also have kettlebells and medicine balls as well. Perfectly sufficient for a short stay.

Lastly, this hotel offers a free hot breakfast each morning in the room next to the lobby. Offerings are pretty typical like sausage, eggs and baked goods. I liked the warm cinnamon rolls that they have here.

I enjoyed my stay at the Holiday Inn Express in Richmond. The location is convenient to the highway and I prefer it over the Holiday Inn on Cambie Road. It is better in every way when you compare the two together.",2014-11-25T01:25:50Z,34
1670,Holiday Inn Express Vancouver Airport - Richmond,4.1,"Stayed here for 2 weeks on a business trip.

Good:
- King bed included 2 soft + 2 hard pillows and comfortable triple sheets.
- Shower area was larger and more modern than expected for a Holiday Inn.
- iPod/iPhone charging dock was available on the alarm clock.
- Electrical outlet was conveniently embedded on the table lamp.
- Ergonomic office chair was comfortable; office table was useful.
- Free WIFI password was provided with room key upon check-in.
- Free continental breakfast. Food was fresh, although variety was absent.
- Only a 5 to 10 minute walk to the Bridgeport Canada Line station, 20-30 minutes away by subway to downtown.
- 3 to 5 minute drive to Aberdeen Centre mall in Richmond.

Complaints:
- Poor quality cable TV. I could not understand the point of offering a HDTV when all the channels were broadcasted in SD. This lack of cable quality needs to be addressed.
- Street parking was free, but gated garage parking inconveniently required a fee.
- Shuttle from airport was only available during the day. I did not find any Holiday Inn shuttles operating at the airport during the late afternoon and evening. Taxi from airport to Holiday Inn was about $15.
- Foreign currency exchange was unavailable at 9:00AM. Their excuse was ""we ran out of money"". The exchage rate is 0.95CAD = 1USD here. For a better rate, go to the Lansdowne Mall  (0.982CAD = 1USD rate), it was the best rate I found in Richmond.
- Housekeeping knocked on door and entered my room at 9AM. Unfortunately, I was still half asleep on my bed and unclothed at the time.

The rooms are clean and warm, bathrooms are a bit upscale from some of the other HIX's, and the bed was perfect.....warm and with plenty of pillows.

The hot breakfast in the morning just, well, hit the spot. Very nice.

I learned something new with this hotel on this trip....I can park my car here in a secure area and leave it when I get on my plane. 7 days was included in my room stay....how about that...!!! Plus they have a nice shuttle to take you to the airport and pick you up when you return.",2013-01-14T17:59:00Z,34
1672,Holiday Inn Express Vancouver Airport - Richmond,4.1,"The room was nice, staff nice, but the breakfast was not what you'd expect, and the airport bus that they ran came to the hotel with only room for 3. The driver instructed everyone else to take a cab. You know, it's an airport hotel, the ride is part of the deal. You can't retrade that when everyone is waiting to get to the airport (lots of people were waiting). As for breakfast, I have never seen such a vast collection of people served by such a small area for food. There was not much food left, and staff couldn't supply it fast enough. There was no room to get to the food, as it was blocked by hungry travelers, hoping for something.",2018-07-03T03:09:57Z,34

Pros:
1)Very clean

3)They use Charmin toilet paper. Excellent!
4) You get Bath and Body toiletries. Another bonus. 
5)Bed are super comfortable. 
6) AC unit is very quiet. 
7) Breakfast buffet offers a wide variety. 
8) Costco is our neighbor. 
Cons:
1) Buffet area is small. During peak breakfast time, it gets very crowded. Employees have a hard time catching up with demand. 
2) You can easily hear other room doors opening and closing.

We checked in with Ian at the front desk and he set us up with a great room with double queen beds on the top floor. If you have an IHG account they waive the parking fee and we also got free breakfast from 6am to 10am. We called for extra towels, at 1230 mind you, and they were really prompt getting up to the room. We are very happy with our stay here and will definitely be staying here again.

1675,Holiday Inn Express Vancouver Airport - Richmond,4.1,"I don't usually review chain establishments unless I have a particularly bad experience, but this experience was so positive I felt I had to.

My parents and I were planning on an overnight stay in Vancouver to gorge on some delicious, delicious Chinese food and make a couple stops along the way. Alas, that was not to be. At 11:30 p.m., just after we crossed the border, our rental car stalled. We called the front desk to let them know we were going to be late, and they were very sympathetic and helpful to the point where they even looked up the garage where we were having our car towed to find out how far away it was. 

When we got to the actual hotel, the lobby was immaculate. Even at midnight, there was fresh coffee in the lobby, and unlike at other chain hotels, the coffee was actually really good. The room was just as comfortable and spotlessly clean, and as an added bonus, the toiletries smelled *amazing*. They provide wi-fi, cable, and lots of outlets. 

The breakfast was your standard continental breakfast with yogurt, pancakes, sausages, eggs, pastries and juice, but everything was fresh and fairly good quality, as opposed to the usual sad, dried out looking hotel breakfasts. 

My experience here was on par with visiting my parents' Holiday Inn Express in Bothell, WA, so this is the chain I'll be trusting from now on when I travel. (stay away from Residence Inn-Marriott!)",2011-04-28T13:56:06Z,34
1676,Holiday Inn Express Vancouver Airport - Richmond,4.1,"Convenient hotel right across from Costco BUT for the price I wouldn't stay again. They put us in a room right next to the elevator which was loud and they were drilling so early in the morning we couldn't even sleep in! There was no complementary water and the coffee bar wasn't restocked with coffee just decaf tea. The beds were supposed to be queen and it was more like a full because both my husband and I had our feet hanging off the bed which was annoying!!

The bathtub floor was dirty so it made me not want to shower in it and we were so tired driving from Washington all night we didn't want to complain and have to switch rooms!

The parking was a joke! The employees park in the customer parking which meant we had to park down the street.

Then the best part was I left the room as clean as it could be and they charged us a smoking fee that was more than the actual room. ($250)
Still waiting for a response from the ""management"".

I'm sorry but Vancouver just has no customer service anywhere that is welcoming anymore.",2017-09-22T23:16:12Z,34
1677,Holiday Inn Express Vancouver Airport - Richmond,4.1,"Great find!  My wife and needed an airport hotel before a morning flight out of YVR, and we found this hotel via an opaque site.  We did not expect much, but we were wrong.

This place is excellent.  We had previously spoken with the staff before our arrival, and their responses to our queries were prompt and on point.  Our check-in was efficient and pleasant, and the free lemonade while we checked in was quite refreshing.

The room is lovely and spacious.  The bedding was clean and nice, as were the towels and toiletries.  The air conditioning did its job efficiently and quietly, and we had a very comfortable night in our large room.

The hotel has a free shuttle service to and from the airport, and it operates on a timely schedule.  It showed up promptly both coming and going, and the driver was friendly.  It takes about 10"" from the airport.

The hotel has free, wi-fi, and a large, full breakfast which is excellent.  (We had a cheese omelet, link sausages, and fresh juice and coffee.  There is also yogurt and baked good available.)

Even at rack rate this hotel is a wonderful place to stay before or after a flight.  It also might serve you well if you don't mind traveling on the nearby light rail into downtown Vancouver.  I would hope to return here on our next trip.",2012-07-29T01:19:39Z,34

Laundry facilities worked well.  The gym was nice and fairly well stocked, different weight medicine balls free hand weights, a couple machines, TV, water towels.

Breakfast was very good, full breakfast (much to my waistlines dismay), hash browns, scrambled & hard boiled eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, cereals, yogurt, juices, coffees, teas, milk, cinnamon rolls and other breads.

1680,Holiday Inn Express Vancouver Airport - Richmond,4.1,"I've stayed in lots of Holiday Inn Expresses over the years and I am a platinum member. This one misses the mark for me. First, 24 hour shuttle does not mean 24 hour shuttle. It means it starts at 4:30am. We have a 5:40 flight so had to extend our rental car to accommodate the lack of shuttle for our flight. Super annoying. Don't advertise something on the website that is not true!!!!!! Besides that the rooms are clean BUT a bit small. And the toilet paper is a good 3-4 feet away from the toilet so it's a freaking Olympic sport just to wipe after going. Breakfast was good when it was stocked (lots of people so it ran out fast). Our room had a scenic view of the Costco and had a sound machine of airplanes taking off out the window. So it's okay but not worth the price compared to other holiday inn Express I've stayed at in the past.",2016-07-06T18:05:24Z,34
1681,Holiday Inn Express Vancouver Airport - Richmond,4.1,"Half the price of the River Rock Casino rooms and very convenient to the Aberdeen Center, Costco (next door), highway into Vancouver, the Casino itself is down a couple of blocks and of course, just down the street to the Richmond Night Market.

We love gambling at the casino and just hopping on an elevator to get to our room when we stay there, but lately we've been put up in the hotel across the street and it's just not worth $240 to have a view of the skytrain instead of the water like we did across the street in the casino building.  

We wind up spending lots more money when we stay at the River Rock because of breakfast and dinner there, so this way, the Holiday Inn Express forces us to get out and about to try out new restaurants which is what travel is all about.  The rooms are clean, quiet and pretty much have all we need except there wasn't a mini fridge in our room.  They charge $8 for parking, but it's behind a secure gate and monitored so I'm good with that.  Free breakfast doesn't hurt if you just want some coffee and juice with a bagel, but don't expect a Bellagio Fountains Brunch spread, it's pretty decent like all the other Express Hotels we've stayed at.",2014-08-26T03:55:41Z,34

1684,Holiday Inn Express Vancouver Airport - Richmond,4.1,"While visiting Seattle I decided to drive to Vancouver since it was only a couple of hours away.  Decided to go through Priceline, at the time I looked it up the rate was $64, which I thought was a great deal.  I waited until the next day to book and it went up by $10.  For the price there isn't much to complain about.  

The hotel charges for parking at a rate of $8 as of Jan 2014, but at the time I booked it was quoted at $5, but never did it say that it would go up Jan 2014.  I told the front desk clerk and she honored the $5 rate since it wasn't updated on the website.  The garage is gated which is nice, but it's small.  They assign you a space number so you are guaranteed a spot which is nice since you paid for the spot. I don't know what happens when the garage is filled.  There is plenty of free parking on the street.  I'm sure during certain seasons of the year it is busier than in Jan when it's the rainy season.  Costco is right across the street.  I see Costco out my window. 

-The hotel lobby is very small, no big deal.  The whole entire family doesn't need to check in together, only one person needs to do that.  
-The rooms are very clean.   Regular size hotel room.
-The bathroom is pretty big, they could have put two sinks instead of one for the big counter they have.  One complaint, they need a soap holder for the bar of soap they provide. 
-The pillows are interesting.  They have two firm pillows and two soft pillows on the bed; it states it on the pillow case.  I have never seen that before.
-They have a coffee maker in the room, but why when they provide coffee and tea 24 hours a day in the lobby.  They also have ginger snap cookies by the coffee and tea bar.  
-The walls are very thin but it wasn't bad at all since most of the patrons were here to sleep.  I couldn't hear any airplanes since we are very close to the airport. 
-The TV is not HD but on their website, they advertise it as they have HD. 
-They offer free Wi-Fi which is a plus.  They give you a password which is on your key card envelope when you check in.  And the Wi-Fi was never spotty like other hotels that offer free Wi-Fi.  It's probably because in order to get access the internet you are required to enter a password. 
-Free local phone calls a plus because I'm from the United States and making a phone call on my cell phone would have been quite expensive.
-They offer free continental breakfast each morning which I didn't try.  The breakfast was pretty basic.  
-A downside is they don't have a fridge and microwave in the room.   Would have been nice if they had a fridge since I was out in Canada eating at restaurants and if I had leftovers I could bring it back for the next day.

Overall, for the price I would definitely stay here again if I'm ever in Canada.  The price is right with free Wi-Fi, clean rooms and free continental breakfast each morning.",2014-01-16T23:42:42Z,34

1689,Holiday Inn Express Vancouver Airport - Richmond,4.1,"I stayed at the Holiday Inn in Richmond, British Columbia in August 2016. The hotel is near the Vancouver airport and they have a free shuttle that takes you there. The hotel is also 10 minutes away from downtown Vancouver and is right across Costco, so that can be very helpful to some people. Also, there is a parking fee of $10, but we found street parking that was free and right outside of the hotel. The hotel is very updated from the inside and out. I found that the hotel was very clean all over as well. Nothing really stood out to me in the room, but I liked how they gave Bath and Body Works products and that the beds were comfortable. The hotel had no pool, which was very disappointing, since all the other Holiday Inns I've had one. To partly make up for that, they had a really nice and well-equipped gym room. The whole room smelled brand new and you could tell the machines were the very latest. Each machine had its own tv which I thought was a very nice bonus. They had a very modern bathroom in the gym as well. I spent a lot of time at the gym and I was very impressed. The hotel included free breakfast, which had all the standard things and a good variety of items. The room to eat breakfast was quite big with comfortable seating and had a choice of outdoors seating as well.

1692,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"I'm so impressed. Honestly, my expectations were low but I had a really good stay here. I'm an Airbnber at heart, but every now and again I'll pop into a hotel when I feel that it's necessary. In this case, the Barclay Hotel was so damn convenient that I couldn't pass up the opportunity to stay here. 

First of all, the price for the location is very reasonable. It's located right off Robson Street amongst all of the fancy hotels, restaurants, and shopping. This is prime time baby. Prime. Time. Now, don't get me wrong; this hotel ain't fancy by any means. But it's clean, comfortable, and convenient. The 3 c's that I will always live for when it comes to accommodations. It's an older hotel so I feel like this is why it's such a bargain when compared to the other newer hotels nearby. But, don't let the age of this hotel fool you; it's a great deal. 

The only rooms that were available during the time that I booked were two queens. When I arrived, the front staff was very kind and helpful. There are no elevators in this hotel so keep this in mind if you have heavy luggage. I'm generally a light packer, so this didn't affect me much. The room was large, bright, and clean. It had a small sofa, work desk, mini fridge and TV (I never watched anything on it). The bathroom was a nice size and also very clean. My room had a nice view of Robson street. 

Housekeeping was great and cleaned my room thoroughly everyday. The heater is old school radiator style, so it took a bit of time for the room to warm up but it definitely kept it warm. I barely saw anyone in the lobby and didn't hear any other guests while I was there. Not sure about the parking situation since I took public transit while I visited, but the fact that I was able to walk to most places was wonderful. 

The train and bus are within a few minutes walk. So many eateries that are literally right next door and across the street. The convenience is what truly did it for me, and I felt completely safe staying here. I would definitely stay here again during a future trip to  Vancouver. You cannot beat the incredible value and prime location.",2023-09-24T06:34:39Z,32
1693,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"In all the best ways, this is an adult hostel! Cute bar downstairs semi-attached to the building... perfect for local casual hangs... affordable pricing for Vancouver... and the right-sized room to simulate a single/double room at a hostel. 
It was a great home base for my weekend stay. 
Out of the room most days, and there's fast wifi... plus a short down Robson street is cute cafes... 

Stay on the third floor if you want to be in a quiet room away from the street sounds, though, I don't know about the fourth floor, but it's likely a safe bet.",2023-01-14T09:56:47Z,32
1694,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"Barclay Hotel is located on Robson street beside of Cora restaurant. This is a nice Hotel, but a little bit old. Unfortunately there is no elevator. Just stairs :) and there is no restaurant in the hotel. If you are looking for room service and breakfast, you should bring your own meal and put in the minibar.

The rooms are simple but comfortables, there are bed, minibar, tv, air con and so on.

Their services are good, the housekeeper cleaned the room so good and the front desk, they are professional and helped us a lot of times with sightseeing in Vancouver, Whistler and Capilano Bridge. 

The good thing about this hotel is, it is a little bit old but they have a good service.. so basically is something that makes the hotel works so much better. I hope you enjoy your stay.",2018-02-25T12:03:23Z,32
1695,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"Wow. Had an amazing stay in this nice hotel tucked inside Robson St. Which is a tourist zone and close to many attractions. We stayed here for 2 nights. The Hotel is on Robson St. Exterior Hotel looks like 1-2 star hotel quality inside looked like 3 stars, The reception area was friendly and they renovation of the interior shows. Nice lounge sit down area. They did have a computer and printer on the side to print out boarding passes and what not. The check in was easy. Note that you will get a set of actual keys to go to your room. We got the 1st floor room # 119 which was at the back of the hotel. The room had 2 double sized beds which was clean, comfortable. Pillows were good. The room itself was spacious had 2 windows looking outside back which was no view really. There was a fridge, table, small sofa, and very small washroom. The Bathroom was small yet good. Felt like Boutique Hotel European Like. The WiFi was really good connection. The room itself has self controlled heat. The AC we did not use was the old style hanging on the window type. One reviewer said the towels were Westin Hotel like this is not true. The towels were basic like 2.5 star like they are a bit rough not soft and majestic.

Some cons to note are if you are a light sleeper bring earplugs. The hallways are made of marble flooring and during our stay we could here everyone walking and also the door needs to slam shut to close so you will hear doors shutting. Also the housekeeping services starts at 8:30am in the morning so if you are adjacent to rooms that need cleaning you will hear them vacuuming and cleaning. The housekeeping was very helpful in cleaning and giving us extra towels if needed. 

Outside the hotel has many restaurants and foodies. There is a London Drugs close by so you can buy water, medicines, snacks, bath care, etc.

Since we stayed during the winter low season Mid Feb 2016. The price per room was well good, we paid $75 CDN a night. I would definitely come back and stay at the Barclay hotel.
I did read the awful reviews below but i did not run into any of those during my stay thankfully.",2016-02-26T19:59:57Z,32
1696,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"Long, but worth the read:
The only reason I'm not giving a one/two star is because of the location. It's extremely convenient and near so many things.
First, the payment. I called ahead of time and spoke with a man asking if I could pay by debit card rather than credit. He assured me that would be fine. I get to the hotel and the lady at the desk told me they ONLY accept credit even though I had been otherwise. She allowed me to do it this once (sure glad they didn't leave me out on the street), but she will charge $50 extra deposit. Last minute expenses aren't a cool thing to run into. 
Second, I get to my room and it is the smallest thing I've ever seen. The bed itself barely even fits. I was tripping over my own feet trying to get to the desk. The bathroom is very small, but I didn't mind that much. The tub was actually really nice and it looked like it had modern tiles. The walls were patchy with paint colors, cracks in the paint on the ceiling, wall was chipped in multiple places, etc..
Second, there was hair on the bed and in the towels in the bathroom. I'm blonde and these were black. I asked for new linens and housekeeping was very sweet. She did however come in, pick off the black hair, and throw it on the ground. Gross. The sizes were also very different; some medium long length and some short, like men's hair.  
Next, and this isn't really their fault, but people are so loud. At 12AM-1AM this morning, there was a couple fighting. Yesterday, the person above me was practically throwing things around, and the person next to me was either tapping on the wall between us or the hotel has rats in the walls. Wouldn't be surprised either way. Also, the hotel smells like trash and cigarettes near my room (just down the hall from entry). 
Finally, my window is facing a street which apparently gets delivery trucks early every morning. They park LITERALLY in front of my window and unload for about 30 minutes. Also, seagulls like to hang out outside the window and make seagull noises.
For amenities, there is cable, but there are a lot of channels that are not available. Also, there's a mini fridge. 
All-in-all, I'm lucky this was such a great price (about $450 for 5 nights), but some of these things are easily avoidable.
*there are no elevators, as well.",2020-01-23T19:30:24Z,32
1697,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"It was what I really needed just for a short stay before a cruise-clean and centrally located for a reasonable price. I got it for just under $80 a night in June. They upgraded me from a single to a double but you would never know because the furniture honestly looks like something you would have at a hotel YMCA. They did have a cool looking vintage couch in the lobby. It had that parlor look to it. Would be nice if they had that theme in the rooms as well. 

I planned my stay very last minute and didn't really think my lodging through on the elevator thing. I was lucky and only had to go up 2 short levels with all my stuff. 

Wifi was very strong in my room, but that may be because I wasn't that high up. 

The location is fairly good based on the distance to the park and transport. I just took the tram from the airport and the 5 bus. To get to the port you take the 5 as well. Keep in mind though that the area seems like it could be Tokyo or something...Very Asian area. 

Why 3 stars? Again the room I stayed in was really worn in looking. I also had a window facing a parking structure and it was really loud throughout the night. Staff was okay, not friendly but not rude. 


It was okay and I probably would stay at again but only if nearby hotels were that much more. I would probably spend an extra $30 a night to be at a nicer place though.",2017-06-21T23:37:24Z,32
1698,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"It must be said: for its location, Barclay is cheap by Vancouver standards.

But when you consider this place has some of the shittiest ""free"" wifi ever (weak to non-existent signal), a convoluted layout worthy of a fire trap, thin floors and even thinner walls and weed/stale smelling rooms, I'm not sure it's that much of a deal anymore.

The corridors upstairs feel like the budget set of a horror movie.",2016-01-02T07:46:01Z,32
1699,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"The location of the Barclay Hotel was the best thing since there's many coffee shops, shopping, drug stores, and restaurants nearby.  I booked two nights and it was very reasonable because of the U.S. dollar exchange rate at a discount.   The rate was about $41 U.S.   But the Continental breakfast is not included like most hotels.  You have to pay $6 - $6.30 extra.   I ended up getting food and canned coffee at the Japanese convenience store that was one block up the street.  
      I stayed in Room 209.  It was small, but ok.   The hallways were marble floors.   The floors were nice and clean but the Room Maids start cleaning and vaccumning at 8:30 am.  I did complain to the Front  Desk when I checked out, but there's nothing I could of done to help that situation.   They have a early Check-in Time of 2pm and probably don't have enough staff to start later in cleaning the rooms.
 So if you like to sleep in, past 8 am, you will be awaken by them talking outside your room, since the sound halls echo and you could hear people leaving and slamming the doors.  
   The walls are thin and the floor board creak.  I heard my neighbors talk until 3 am one night.  The person above me was rearranging their luggage and thumpy sounds.   The traffic noise from outside wasn't bad at night or early morning.   Since most commuters use Georgia St. to and from N. Vancouver.    
   If I had more of a budget, I would of stayed at the Empire Hotel instead, that was $69 U.S. So the Barclay is better than a stay at a hostel since you do get a private bathroom.",2015-11-13T06:27:04Z,32
1700,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"Great part of town, great staff, very clean and comfortable. Each room has a mini fridge too. Bob and Jason are especially great at the front desk. Walking distance from all the fun.....not a boutique hotel, but has exemplary service one would expect from a 5 star boutique experience.",2017-06-14T19:30:49Z,32
1701,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"No elevator... However, the nice young gentleman at the front desk helped carry one of our bags, so kudos to him. Not a family type location.

Ok here go the pros and cons all mixed together. Make of it what you will....
*The location is pretty darn good
*The room was just a bit worn and torn
*Good heating
*The bathroom is a bit cramped. 
*My knees touched the wall, sitting on the toilet 
*Inexpensive
*clean

1702,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"This is not a 4-star hotel with fancy amenities nor do they claim to be. It was wonderful! The location is fantastic - close to everything - the rooms are clean and the staff is wonderful. The manager, Jonathan was extremely helpful and very professional and the front desk staff were friendly and welcoming. For the price, this is a hidden gem. I will definitely be back.",2016-09-13T17:20:32Z,32
1703,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"As I sit looking out at my room, I think how lucky I am that I found this hotel on short notice. It looks exactly like the hotels I end up staying in in Europe. Basic, cheap, and no frills. My room is spacious, my bed comfy. I booked into a double which was $69.00 CDN.

There's a bar in the bottom level called the ""Bistro Lounge"" where I met an interesting couple from Germany that had been traveling aimlessly since the beginning of the Olympics.

Don't expect luxury here, or that it looks anything like the photos on their website. It's basically a hostel where you have your own private room. But for $69.00? Not so bad considering it's safe, clean and close to everything worth seeing. I haven't decided whether or not I would come back to stay. I'll get online and check out nearby hotels next time.

Here's a tip: If you stay here bring your own blowdryer!",2010-05-01T21:53:16Z,32
1704,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"It seems like some reviewers may have missed that this hotel is $79 for a single person in a room with a double-bed... in a city where rooms are generally $150-200. My four-star review reflects expectations commensurate with the price. 

The Barclay Hotel was actually nicer than I expected, given the price. The rooms are clean and well-appointed. They are clearly intended just as places to sleep, because in a major city, you should be out enjoying yourself rather than sitting in the room! By that I mean my room was very small (just a bed and desk with about 4 feet around it, and a tiny (15""?) TV. Since that's all I wanted it for, that was fine. No dresser or closet. 

The negatives were: (1) The free wifi was flaky, which is a big deal given the insane prices for international data roaming (which I was not going to use)! So the wifi was my only way to make plans or contact my loved ones. (2) Because of the small size of the rooms, you're very close to the hallway, so can definitely hear doors opening and shutting and loud voices, if other guests are being inconsiderate. (3) I didn't care about this, but there's no elevator, so be aware if you have a physical impairment. (4) No in-room coffee. 

Positives not already mentioned: (1) Location, location, location! It's away from the noise of downtown but still easy walking distance from it, as well as from Stanley Park and SkyTrain. Plenty of restaurants and other businesses are right outside. (2) My room was quiet, facing an interior air shaft, even though the hotel is on a major street. 

But the most important positive is the price -- again, $79! I'd definitely stay here again.",2013-08-23T12:58:29Z,32
1705,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"I came to Canada from California ( driving ) with 2 of my friends to see the WWC Finals and this was right on the main street of Vancouver which was awesome! but the hotel is obviously very old... when we got to the hotel the first thing we noticed was there is stairs to get to the lobby.. there is no elevators at all in this hotel.. we were on the 3rd FL with a ton of stuff to carry up! i did not like this at all. Then we get to the room the carpet is old but the bathroom had been upgraded and was very clean.. the beds were clean but not comfortable at all. The hotel was on a slant so the whole room was not even.. .so your vertigo is all thrown off and kind of makes you sick...

it is walking distance to Stanley Park which is great

and good mile to the Stadium but where ever you walk there is a ton of shopping and restaurants and pubs!

Not my first choice hotel but i would stay here again.",2015-07-08T22:33:27Z,32
1706,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"Centrally located in West End, near Davie, Denman and Stanley Park. City Centre is walkable and nearby, but the Robson bus is right outside. Good pricing and nice rooms, with a big dresser for longer stays. 

Main Street, Commercial/Broadway and W. 4th are cooler streets to stay on, but the familiar sometimes is best.

It's quite close to a large number of food options and is also very close to Stanley Park and the boat yard. I really liked having the convenience store immediately across the street and a restaurant next door.

1713,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"I spent one night in the Barclay Hotel, due to it being the cheapest option in the downtown area. The receptionists were very helpful and accommodating to my needs. The hotel itself is outdated and has a very creepy vibe to it. The room was small and there were stains on the bedsheets and the tv did not work. Not to mention that the WiFi was very spotty. The walls were very thin and you could hear every person that walked in the hallway outside and every door has to slam shut so it was hard to fall asleep. There was no parking for the hotel either, so I had to park on the street. After checkout the next morning I realized that my car which I had parked directly in front of the hotel had been broken into and rummaged through, although this isn't the hotel's fault, I would recommend to be very careful in the area in which the hotel is located because it's sketchy, and not to leave anything in your car. I also realized that I had left my bag with $300 worth of cosmetics in the hotel room. I called the front desk right after I checked out and they claimed that the housekeepers had not found the bag, although I know that I had left it in the room. If you decide to stay at this hotel I would recommend not leaving ANYTHING valuable in your room because it WILL get stolen. I wouldn't even leave valuables in the room during the day because the housekeepers will steal them. I am extremely disappointed with the integrity of the staff of this hotel and I will NEVER stay here again.",2019-08-20T17:07:53Z,32
1714,Barclay Hotel,3.8,Not impressive from the outside but the room was actually pretty nice. The bathroom was really small and the shower was pretty horrible (it was just really small and the shower pressure was really low). We were on the first floor in the back of the hall and didn't think the bar was too loud. Great location too. They offer free wifi but don't bother trying to use it.,2012-06-27T13:32:11Z,32
1715,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"Kind of a middle-of-the-road hotel. Conveniently located on Robson. No elevator, very limited parking, and an older Feel left me giving it only three stars. Friendly staff helped to make up for it. Not my first choice but good in a pinch.",2016-06-16T14:01:21Z,32
1716,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"We took a trip to Vancouver on a whim and booked a hotel room with these guys at a moments notice. The employees at the front desk were friendly and accommodating.  They even upgraded us from a double to a queen bed for free. The hotel is close to a lot of cool restaurants and we had no trouble getting to the heart of vancouver from the hotel.
The hotel rooms are in no way luxurious, but are cozy and perfect for the price.

Also we fell in love with the asian school girl and the awkward guy with the glasses at the front desk. xoxo",2012-04-04T07:03:57Z,32
1717,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"Man I loved this place! A hotel room in this part of town under $150 a night can be hard to find in the high season, and our rate was $79 for a normal room on the 3rd floor with a comfy double bed. It's super basic - I often stay in dorms, hostels, and YWCAs and I don't expect anything fancy for this rate. Very small room with no dresser or closet, nice bathroom, very clean, great maid service, super friendly staff, no elevator, AC unit in the room (which was an unexpected luxury), cute cafe for cheap breakfast. Just ask for a hair dryer and they will lend you one. Hotel could seriously not have been in a better location - right on Robson in the West End. Amazing sushi at every turn, English Bay is a 10 minute walk, sky train station a 15 minute walk. I will definitely stay here again.",2012-07-15T18:06:22Z,32

1720,Barclay Hotel,3.8,"Like others have said, you can't beat the location.  My boyfriend and I searched quite a bit for hotels in Vancouver and nicer ones in the same area were much more expensive.  Since we were spending more time exploring the city than hanging in our room we were fine with staying in a cheaper room, although it was actually pretty nice to my surprise.  Large comfortable bed, seating area, desk, dresser and large clean bathroom.  The lighting was terrible and trying to get good sleep was hard at times.  If you're a light sleeper, bring earplugs as the walls are paper thin and you can hear people talking, walking and closing (slamming) doors everywhere.  The cleaning ladies have two volumes: loud and louder.  Around 8:00 every morning you could hear them talking, laughing, yelling to each other, vacuuming and banging said vacuum around on the doors and walls so good luck if you were out late and wanting to sleep in a bit. I did find a blow dryer under the bathroom sink but no coffee maker which would have been nice, but there were lots of coffee shops within minutes of the hotel which helped.  The front desk was great and super helpful with any questions.  They lent me an iron & board (none in the room), gave suggestions on places to eat and called a taxi for us when we headed out for dinner across town one night.  Again, the location was great.  We were able to easily walk to most places like the Aquarium in Stanley Park, down to the Westin to catch the free Suspension bridge bus and to bike shops when we rented one for the day to check out other areas around Vancouver.  Lots of shops and places to eat each way on Robson St.  All in all, it is a great place if you just need an affordable room, but if you are looking for more amenities, nicer digs or R&R - pass on this one.",2014-05-31T05:46:38Z,32

1722,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"So many great things to mention.  We stayed for almost a week over Canada day and the 4th of July.  Service was perfect unlike other high end establishments during holiday periods we've experienced in the past. 
1- Valet was always ready at a moments notice, and didn't judge me for not making it to an ATM the first few days . (We caught up with gratitude, we promise)

2- Room was exquisite.  Standard size quarters with an extra large bathroom. HEATED TILE FLOORS!!! Large tub and seating for 2 for room service

3- Room service was a delight as well. The person delivering made the delivery an experience we were not expecting. The food did not disappoint either.

4- Housekeeping was executed perfectly and complimented by an amazing and well thought out collection of designer soaps and complimentary toiletries.  Turn down service was spotty for us early sleeping folks, but that's our own problem 

5-Front Desk was the icing on the cake.  Joseph was who welcomed us, and we were floored with his positive, professional, and sincere welcoming.  Checking us in was happening seamlessly as he was answering our many questions and giving us tips for our heavily planned ""tour de cuisine"".  Joseph took time to discuss the local fare, the new Michelin listed restaurants (one downstairs actually!!) which was the main purpose of our trip, cuisine.  To top all that off, Joseph showed us their beautifully curated fragrance collection. 

Extra notes:
Pool and spa area are awesome.

4th floor outdoor bar/restaurant is also awesome

Housekeeping had Velcro for our phone charger cables!! They also left wipes for our sunglasses (which were many )

Room tech was also pretty slick,  amazing design and investment with rock solid technology (my industry )

I loved the little details such as the ""night light"" button which turned on dim lights for you to find your way at night and the ""privacy"" button. The architecture of this hotel is stunning and the pool was so beautiful. The tiles on the bottom of the pool changed color and it was nice how empty it was. Service was very good and housekeeping was amazing - they even wrapped our iPhone cords for us. They always made sure our room was well-stocked and clean.

When we walked into our room, we noticed it was not the upgrade promised. The team did help fix this by moving us.

The gym was clean as always and housekeeping was outstanding. Some of the best we have seen - they go the extra mile to organize everything beautifully. Thank you to the amazing housekeeping team!

Breakfast is well prepared but always very slow. We often wait a very long time to be seated and service could be improved. We didn't see this improve between this stay and our last stay nearly a year ago. I think adding just one more server would improve the experience.

They were welcoming, friendly, and quick to make sure all of my requests were met! THANK YOU TO THE BOTH OF YOU!  The rest of the staff were great too! 

The room?! OMG! I loved it! First, the bed pillows! Once I laid down on the bed and my head hit the pillows... it was like my head fell on heavenly clouds! It was the perfect fit! The best sleep ever in a hotel!!! I swear it was the pillows. The 2nd best part of the room, the bathroom! Huge with a deep bathtub to soak in and a tropical rainfall shower. I felt like I was in a spa! Pure relaxation in the room. 3rd, my every evening surprise for the duration of my trip was cookies beside the bed, water bottles, and slippers laid out. Holy Moses! I felt like I was royalty. Now this is what I call a vacation. I could've just chilled in the room the entire time but I also had to get out and see Canada! Hahaha 

The fitness center was on point! It had towels, water, cardio machines, weights, mats, and an area to stretch. I was able to get my day started out right!

In summary, Rosewood Hotel Georgia provides an excellent blend of location, comfort, and service. It delivers an exceptional travel experience, be it for business or leisure, and I couldn't recommend it more highly. My time there was truly a five-star experience.",2023-06-10T14:26:18Z,128
1728,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,An exceptional level of service at this beautiful hotel. The parking valet to the housekeeping staff were all above and beyond. Having stayed at 5 star properties all over the world I can tell you that this hotel deserves the 5 stars. We had a corner room with the beautiful bathroom and fantastic bath tub. It is nicely decorated in a sophisticated palette. We took advantage of the spa at the hotel and had wonderful massages. The spa is billed as the only 5 star spa in Canada although there is no sauna or steam room at this spa. They do have a warm indoor salt water swimming pool and a nice workout room. We ate at each of the places in the hotel and really enjoyed the service and the quality of the food.,2023-03-06T07:44:30Z,128

This trip to Vancouver we wanted to try somewhere new to us and  we read great reviews on travel and leisure, so we gave it a try.

Yes the property is beautiful and every amenities you could desire, but what makes it is the staff.

From top to bottom every person is exceptional. That's what makes it a memorable trip and experience!

The concierge with the dog treats, extra poop bags, smiles and food tips, the maintenance team helping with locked luggage late at night, the front desk always smiling and chatting, the valet with cold water and directions, the friendly hostesses at the restaurant who play with our dogs,

Whoever is running the hotel knows how to train and motivate a staff

This is my third time visiting.  The hotel could not have been nicer, especially the staff. They welcomed us with a bottle of Champagne and a bowl of fresh berries with a hand written note wishing a good stay and anniversary.  They even upgraded us to a better room.  The beds were comfortable and the sheets were luxurious..........I thought about taking them home!  Turned down service with two shortbread cookies and a couple of bottles of water.  The super nice touch....the towels left on the floor by the bed so when you get up your feet are not on the carpet.  It is all the nice little touches that make the difference.  Thank you to all the staff!

1734,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"Absolutely, my favorite hotel by far. Came here with my husband for a week and loved everything about this hotel. They changed our bed sheets everyday as requested, provided ""turn down service"", complimentary bottle water every night. Turn down service occured every night around 6-7 pm and they rearranged the room and made everything nice and neat. Includes, complimentary cookies, bottle water and making sure all soaps/lotion/shampoo were all stocked up. 

The setting of the room was perfect (they were nice to give as a corner room, top floor), cozy with a modern look. We especially enjoyed the two sink bathroom, nice tub and shower. The sheets were soft and high quality. The staff were top notch, professional and friendly. We were greeted every time and they did not treat us like little kids (cause we look like little kids). 

The location of this hotel was very convenient to many stores, restaurant and museums. 

I've stayed at Four Seasons Boston and also had my wedding there. Also stayed at other various places in the US. But, Rosewood Hotel Georgia is still my top choice. I highly recommend this place to anyone!

In addition, they are superbly located in Vancouver. You're right across the street from the art museum, close to mass transit, and within walking distance of many attractions. 

The hotel itself is beautiful. It's been astoundingly restored so it feels retro, even with modern conveniences like wifi. The Rosewood Georgia is comfortably elegant, luxuriously appointed, perfectly located, and beautifully staffed.

Returned today after a long absence.  My first server was an Indian woman, and I saw butter chicken on the menu so I asked her how it was. She did not give me a secret head shake so I had high hopes. It turned out to be a bit under salted and lacked depth. 

I guess stick with the whiter parts of the menu?  I dunno, it's sure priced like it's going to taste good. The Hotel Georgia cocktail was very good, though. 

Later another woman took over as my server, and she failed to notice my cleared plate pushed to the opposite end of my table for 10 minutes despite there only being one other table there.

1744,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"Husband and I took almost a 3 week vacation from California to Vancouver Canada and then back to Cali. Throughout the course of our vacation, we stayed at 4 hotels. I'm starting from worst to best. This being the second best.
Husband and I needed a place to stay before embarking on our Disney cruise. We wanted something close to the Canada place ship terminal and also a hotel with a parking garage that could accommodate our truck. This hotel is only a 6 minute drive to the ship terminal and has a 7ft parking garage. Valet services only. Valet is $57. Steep but at least we had a peace of mind our truck was more secure and not out in the public where it's more at risk to get broken into. 
Everyone at this hotel was absolutely courteous! The valet men were absolute gentlemen insisting they take down our luggage for us. Everyone at the front desk greeted us with a big smile, provided us with complimentary water bottles (husband called it rich water haha) , the bell man was also a gentlemen. For dinner we ate the outdoor garden restaurant where the aesthetics were gorgeous, absolutely pleasing to the eyes. Everyone there was friendly and attentive. The food and mock tails were exquisite as well. Recommend the lobster tacos. Expensive but so worth it! 
The room was kind of small but nice and extremely clean. The bathroom was big and fancy. The bath tub was fun and relaxing to soak up in. For the shower, it was a rainfall shower. I've never been in a rainfall shower so that alone was an experience! The hotel is very expensive! $500 a night!!! However this is a 5 star hotel and it definitely felt like it and shows in the rooms and services. We didn't feel worthy haha! So up to you if it's worth the price or not but for us yes we would normally not spend that much on a hotel for 1 night but we were on vacation and celebrating so we splurged and we had a wonderful experience! :)",2022-07-04T00:54:27Z,128

Staff were friendly and incredibly kind.

We were staying for 5 days, 4 nights and our closet was small. Michael was kind enough to talk to front desk even though we weren't asking for a room change! They called and provided us the room next door with more closet space.

We love ice and asked for it daily and I never once felt like they were annoyed. I know that may be considered ""small"" but I have had many instances where staff was annoyed.

Turn down service, room service and valet were all a great experience.

1747,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"One, if not the, best hotel that I've stayed in so far! The lobby is beautiful, service is friendly, and there is free WiFi. No complimentary breakfast, but Vancouver is full of great eats already.

We ended up booking our rooms via Hotels.com as none were available on Rosewood's website. For a Superior Room (2 double beds, 1 bedroom), we paid a bargained price of $155 in USD nightly for six nights. Upon booking, we noted that we would be checking in close to midnight, which the hotel had no problems with.

The check-in process was smooth and our room was neatly arranged. A bottle of water and cookie was even provided for each of us. The best part of the room was honestly the shower though! It was gigantic with a rain shower head. I was also fond of the bathroom's design with the fogged glass door separating the toilet and the night light. Complimentary slippers were even provided! No troubles with noise level either.

Post checkout I was mistakenly charged $22.05 for consumption of items in the private bar, but they were quick to retract the charges after I notified them. To be fair, I did shift items around to store restaurant leftovers, which might have caused the confusion. That being said, it would be convenient if the rooms provided a fridge for customers to use.

I definitely would stay at this hotel again the next time I'm in town. The hotel being located in downtown is extremely convenient as well.",2020-02-04T05:16:47Z,128

It was clear that guest privacy was a priority.  

The hotel gym was phenomenal, outfitted with the best cardio equipment, machines, and free weights.  I really enjoyed a private mirrored area that had medicine balls, mats, and a ballet bar.  Like the rest of the hotel, the gym was extremely clean.

1752,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"Absolutely marvelous experience!!

Service 5/5 - The front desk attendants were courteous, polite, and very helpful. Not only did they allow me to check in early but they also upgraded my room to a Deluxe King which was a real treat. They explained the many amenities and hotel features thoroughly and offered continued service to me during my visit. Turn down service also excellent and the staff really made sure to create a luxury experience for me. 

Room 5/5 - The deluxe king room was perfect for me (sole traveler). The bed was incredibly comfortable with memory foam pillows. The decor was tasteful and elegant while the electronics were surprisingly modern. Lights were controlled by button allowing me to have a bit more control which was nice. My favorite part of the room was the bathroom - specifically the soaking tub. The hotel also offers some lovely scented bath salts for you to use and I took full advantage of all the things. There's an espresso maker, wine bar, and an array of beverages also which was convenient. 

Location 5/5 - The Rosewood is close to everything. It's less than one block from Nordstrom and a very large shopping area. It's minutes walking distance from the waterfront and situated right next to a transportation center. For being in the heart of downtown it's surprisingly quiet. Either the walls are really well insulated or this city has its own version of ""quiet hours.""

Cleanliness 5/5 - Immaculate. I check the room extensively when I arrive and this passed my open-every-drawer-move-furniture-around test. The bed linens, bath towels, and even the remote were spotless. 

Covid-19 Protocol 3/5 - When I arrived I wasn't notified that BC was under order to wear masks indoors. I saw several guests without them either in the hallways or in the lobby. This confused me, but ultimately didn't detract from my experience. Especially since the hotel is much smaller as a boutique hotel. 

All in all this was an experience that I will cherish for a while. The Rosewood is where elegance and taste meet. It reminds me of the Waldorf in many ways. I cannot wait to return!",2021-08-28T14:07:00Z,128

The hotel is absolutely lovely, everyone we encountered knew our names and knew that it was our anniversary even though we were only there for the weekend! Loved the historic charm of the hotel and loved our room as well, upgrading to the Deluxe room was worth it. Rooms are quiet, beds uber comfy and location is clutch. The deluxe room has a free standing tub so I came prepared with my favorite bath bubbles, make sure you do too, sooooo relaxing. While the lobby kept much of the original architecture intact, the rest of the hotel is updated. We also opted for the spa package. My husband chose a massage while I opted for a facial, such a treat and just the relaxing weekend we needed!

I usually stay at the Pacific Rim or Waterfront both Fairmont chains. For some reason this week both hotels were fully book and I was stuck to book Hotel Georgia. I read some good reviews on Yelp so I thought it should an ok choice. Arrived at 3:30pm and checked in and still had to wait another 5 mins for apparently the manager to do a final ""inspection"" to the room. The rooms are seriously so tiny I'm not sure what the manager was inspecting. And if he did the inspection he definitely didn't do a good job as he missed the bobby pins and hair ties with hair in it on the room floor. Pretty gross!  I got room 402 with the windows were facing the restaurant bar. Like literally. I usually sleep with the window blinds open. So literally when I roll to the side people are eating and drinking and watching me sleep. What hotel builds a room directing in front of a bar and secondly it's super noisy with people talking and music blaring. The rooms are tiny for what you pay for. I paid over $400 per night!!! My first and last time at Hotel Georgia. I'm not impressed. I complained to the front desk and they said they can't do anything about it. Their only option is to make me move everyday. What kind of customer service is that to inconvenience your guests!?! I'm mad I booked 3 nights here and can't wait to leave this place. Left a bad taste.

Unfortunately if you are a guest, you will feel the repercussions of the labor dispute. Many of the amenities are unavailable such as the cocktail lounges and room service yet there aren't any adjustments in the price to the guest. You will need to cross an active picket line to enter the property. Photography is NOT allowed. The hotel security demanded we delete our photographs from our phones. 

Not a very nice way to spend a vacation. Maybe the hotel should make a better effort to take care of their employees so their guests don't pay the price.",2019-10-25T19:27:42Z,128
1758,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"Again i am going to ignore the pricing because i again assume that one of the first things people usually do on a hotel is check out the price per night of stay at the hotel if they are looking for a hotel to check in when visiting vancouver. Instead i am going to just rate the hotel based on its ambience, location, customer service, professionalism , amenities and ambience in the room and all in all comfort factor that me as a customer felt in this hotel.

Like the saying goes "" With great power comes great responsibility"" , i firmly believe that ""Great quality comes at a price"" and in this case since i was after quality, i had signed up for the price i was paying for that quality. But even then quality has to be delivered day in and day out ie on a consistent basis and it is on this front that rosewood hotel georgia nets a clear winner.

Day in and day out for the entire duration of my stay at this hotel, me and my family were treated like rockstars. Most of our requests were met with such speed, professionalism, courteousness and with such warmth that we actually forgot we were away from our home and to top it we had stunning view of downtown vancouvers sky scrapers from our window that me and my family absolutely loved.

We had breakfast at the hotel and boy was it good. It was part of our room package but really the best breakfast we have ever had. Each and every day the breakfast would turn up on time on a table rolled all the way upto our room by the most friendly and professional staff i have ever seen and each day would end with a turndown service wherein we were always replenished with water without us having to ask. The good thing about this hotel is mostly everything save for the laundry is manufactured or done in house within the hotel and hence available quickly and are of great quality.

For those with young kids and for those needing extra amenities in your room , this hotel would not disappoint you if you chose to ignore the price.

The hotel also houses some of the finest restaurants in town including the famed hawksworth restaurant. 

The room was cleaned to perfection everyday, services rendered perfectly and on time, had plenty of facilties including the best rain shower i have seen in bathroom as well as extremely well regulated temperatures in the room and a private minibar (have to pay for this separately though) thats stocked up on wine, candies and some energy bars as well as third party vendor water , soda etc. 

Overall the best experience me and my family have had in a hotel so far and hence the 5 star rating and of course would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting vancouver and wanting a quality experience staying in one of the hotels there.",2016-11-13T01:09:38Z,128
1759,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"I came here for my birthday weekend in December. I picked this as it is ranked as the best hotel in British Colombia. We arrived around 2 AM during the night, and check in was a bit... complicated. Of course we were tired adjusting to the time zone difference. We were given complimentary water bottles and then the key to our room (the staff is extremely friendly). We went to the room, and we just couldn't seem to figure out how to unlock the door. After jiggling the door handle for a bit and pushing on the door, the door popped open and widened very slowly. Honestly, it really creeped us out! Ghosts! Thankfully, a sleepy lady peeped around the door, and said, ""I think you have the wrong room."" Soooo... we dragged our luggage back down to the reception desk and told them what happened. Two workers seemed confused for a bit and asked if that lady seemed upset. I told them it was my birthday, and asked if perhaps they could upgrade our room after such a mistake. However, I just got ""the look."" We ended up with the room right next door to the original room. 

The bed is VERY comfortable. I found it super soft and cozy. My bf prefers firm beds and was worried he would wake up with a hurting back. The next morning, we both felt great! The large bathroom has HEATED floors. At first, it seemed off-setting... but the next morning, it was so soothing (especially after getting out of the shower). The shower... large shower with amazing water pressure in a rainfall shower head. The only down side was the hot water tended to go in and out so a cold shower was never fun. There is a was a huge bathtub also with some bath salts next to it. Unfortunately, we never had a chance to try that out. Oh, and the toiletry smelled like tea tree oil. Some people may love that scent, but I really wish I had brought my own shampoo and stuff (the one time I didn't...). The turn down service every evening included two delicious shortbread cookies. We always got two new water bottles each night. The first night, there was a small platter with fruit welcoming us. The second night, we came home to a bottle of wine with a note apologizing for the inconvenience of the check-in. Sadly, we didn't get to try the wine either, but the gesture was very much appreciated. 

This hotel seems a little small, but it is in prime location. It is right across from The Four Seasons, a mall with Nordstroms, and the Vancouver Art Gallery. It is also in walking distance to Canada Place and Robson Street where there were so many restaurants and shops. We were able to quickly walk to the Hyatt Regency where the free shuttle to Capilano Suspension Bridge picks up and drops off also.

We didn't try any of the restaurants here, but we did go use the swimming pool the last morning we were there. It is a fairly large indoor pool. It is described as a heated saltwater pool. It was lukewarm (slightly chilly) with perhaps a pinch of salt. I'm not complaining. I just wanted to be able to play in the water on Christmas Eve. The lights in the pool constantly change colors, and there are ample towels and lounge chairs around the pool. Sadly, we didn't get to try any of the spa services though since they were pretty much fully booked. There is also a nice little work out gym in the spa area.

Overall, it was a great cozy hotel in a prime location. I guess I had higher expectations for the #1 rated hotel in not only Vancouver but British Columbia. I'm not sure I'd return to this hotel the next time I'm back as there are other great options it seems.",2019-01-25T04:03:18Z,128

1762,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"For my last review on a recent trip to Vancouver, I wanted to share a very cool hotel.  The Rosewood Hotel Georgia has a lot of history.  Guests have included Hollyood Royalty:  John Barrymore, Marlene Dietrich, Errol Flynn, Sir Laurence Olivier, John Wayne and Gary Cooper.  In additon, British royalty has stayed here:  Edward Prince of Wales, his brother George and the Duke of Kent.  The hotel is located one block West of the City Center Skytrain Station, on the corner of Georgia and Howe across the street from the Four Seasons.

The ambiance is very nice.  When you walk in classiness resonates from within.  If you enter on the Georgia Street side, the casual Bel Cafe is to your right.  If you walk in the Howe Street entrance, you walk straight to the elevators that need a room key to go up.  The hotel also features the high-end Hawksworth, by local Chef David Hawksworth.  The pool, spa and fitness center.  However, there is also the semi-casual Reflections Outdoor Restaurant.  Lastly, you also have the recently refurbished 1927 Lobby Lounge to grab a late night cocktail:  5 Stars.

The rooms are nicely appointed.  We had a King Suite (500 sf), and there was plenty of room:  Plus the third night was free from a deal I found on Expedia!  There is a separate tub and shower, nice robes and Snoop-ish bedroom slippers:  5 Stars.

The service was on point.  A nice Filipina lady named Grace initially informed us that the room would not be ready until closer to 3:30 (it was 1:30 at the time).  However, while we were relaxing in the lobby, she informed us a room became available:  5+++ Stars for Grace!!!  The Asian concierge was super helpful w/ making ride arrangements and the bellman from the West Indies was very pleasant:  4 Stars.

Secondarily, we were given a complimentary bottle of 2010 Mission Hills Cabernet Merlot.  Mission Hills is in British Columbia's wine growing region of Okangan Valley, and was voted Canada's Top Winery for 2013.  Now that is excellent customer service!!!

Lastly, where else can you get a ride in a Bentley to any where in DT Vancouver!!!  Jim was the coolest driver I have ever had.  He is a 60 year resident and did a little tour for us as he drove us to Gastown, Granville Island and Stanley Park.  Beamer, Benz or Bentley?

Rolled in with a 4 year old in tow, and they didn't bat an eye.  Beautiful accommodations made for the little one.

1765,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"Stay away.This hotel has a pretty face and an ugly personality As you step inside you can't help but notice the beauty of this stunning property, it lived up to every expectation of grandeur...and then you arrive at the check in desk and that facade melts away with EVERY interaction you have with employees.First I tried to book an experience from their website before arrival. Admittedly with short notice and I expected the answer to be a no,but I did expect an answer.Nobody ever even had the decency to respond to my multiple emails.I had chosen this hotel specifically for the heated marble flooring in the bathroom. I love a good private moment of a spa experience. When we arrived in our room just before 5 the flooring was not working.Engineering arrived within 30minutes took a look, tried something and then said he would need to do some work and it would take some time.Wanting to just start getting ready but knowing this could potentially mean it never getting fixed during our stay I wanted to know how much time and at 5.35 I was told 2 hours. I said that wouldn't work and we'd need a different room to get ready in.He left the room came back and said he could have it ready in 30minutes. Perfect. We agreed to go explore the hotel and grab a drink before coming back to get ready.We tried to grab a drink at the terrace bar and were not even allowed past the host stand being told repeatedly that this hotel doesn't allow you to take drinks to your room ""due to liquor laws"" which makes no sense since there's a mini bar in the room and room service serving alcohol.So we went and tried the lobby bar, where we were allowed to order a drink to take to our room.While waiting for our drink to be made we were subjected to the spectacle of watching a cocktail waitress telling her manager off.When we returned to our room after 25minutes the floor was not complete.I waited until 35minutes before asking how much longer and was told another 30minutes. I called the front desk to request a room change.Repeatedly I clearly expressed any room would work I just needed heated flooring,that engineering leaving and coming back while I'm at dinner was not an option& that I was particularly angry at being lied to about timing.I was told she would call me back with a solution within 5minutes.After 12 minutes she called back and said there were no other rooms and our options were either wait for them to fix it or have them leave and come back while we were at dinner. There was a repeated implication that we should be grateful that we are in an upgraded room. I did not ask for an upgrade. I was not offered an upgrade. I was put in this room at check in because the hotel is oversold. I said this would not work and find us a room. She said she'd call back in 2 minutes. After 3 minutes my husband called her because we were losing so much time. Finally they had a room for us. When I asked to confirm that it had underfloor heating she said ""supposedly"" what and absolute joke! You didn't want to check that before offering this room? So we said we want to see it before agreeing to move to make sure.The room worked so we moved to a much downgraded room than originally planned. It was over 2hours from check in to when we got in our new room.She did listen to my concern that I was now likely not going to be able to get a table at the restaurant I wanted to go to and got us a reservation.They called at 10.10pm. I ignored call as I was getting ready for bed.They called again immediately after so I answered.She said she wanted to send an amenity to our room right now.I SHOULD have thought back to their lack of concept of time. Shame on me. At 10.45PM a server arrived with a cheese board and bottle of red wine.I was already asleep.I was however woken up by the fact that the server had no understanding of talking quietly when somebody is asleep in the room.Something that wouldn't have been an issue if I was in a suite as I had originally booked. Ultimately a few hours after I left the hotel I received an email saying my stay would be complimentary, which feels like an attempt to avoid any negative reviews, but I'll accept nevertheless.  I was never looking for free stuff. I was looking to not be lied to, and to be listened to. All I wanted was to be changed rooms (I didn't care if it was an upgrade or a downgrade) and it took them 2 hours and insane aggravation for them to do that. Making my dinner reservation, and the quality of the drinks I got from the lobby bar are the only reasons they even get a second star.",2022-06-19T00:56:34Z,128

The room, the bathroom, and the whole set up is wonderful. I stayed in a room with a king bed and felt like royalty here. There is turn-down, which is much appreciated when you're at work all day. Walking into the room with calming music, a cookie, fresh water every night for 5 days was amazing.

1767,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"I stayed at the Rosewood Hotel for a few nights while visiting a friend in Vancouver. Let me first off start by my arrival from the airport. 

Their valets rush, and by rush I mean they move with a purpose, everything from opening your door for you, greeting you politely and offering to take your bags up to the reception area was efficient, friendly and well executed. They have been trained exceptionally.

The reception staff was always smiling and greeted you upon arrival and when leaving the hotel to wander the city. They were all very well trained and experienced in their customer service and deliver the experience of a high end hotel that rivals experiences I have had with Vegas locations.

The room, wow I cannot even begin to describe the warm, comfortable atmosphere. Every small attention to detail was perfectly pristine. The bathroom was impeccable with the waterfall type shower to the giant standalone tub, If I could I would uproot their bathroom and put it in a house. The pool area to me was somewhat lackluster perhaps due to the location of it within the hotel, not 100% sure but for me it was the least exciting of my stay.

The location of the hotel itself is very central to Vancouver - the parts that matter I'm referring to. The entire stay there our car sat in the valet and we walked all around the city. Every restaurant and shopping location was easy to reach and navigate to.

Whether it's your first trip to Vancouver or you frequent the trip, I would definitely recommend the Hotel Georgia.",2015-05-05T17:58:42Z,128

Lobby is kind of dark but it's ok. There is a bar where you can hang out and get a drink. 
Only down side is that there is not much storage in the rooms but a couple of very small drawers in a small closet. Is like you have to live out of your suitcase. For  a night or two but for 10 days is a little uncomfortable not to have space to unpack. 
We want to help conserve water but there is no hooks to hang towels and if pit back on the bar they change it anyway:) Beds are nice, clean, comfortable. Bathrooms clean and spacious, turn down feels good; every time you come back to the room is refreshed.

No doubt any renovations from before to now, is totally night and day.  Reminds me of Ruth's Chris Steakhouse when you walk into the lobby, elegance and class all the way.  Dimmed mood, chandeliers, mahagony wood thoughtout, and nicely dressed staff.

Had the pleasure to deal with Matthew Wu, the head concierge, who has the rare distinction of being a Member of the Les Clefs d'Or Canada.  So no wonder his knowledge, service, and professionalism is up to par at such a fine establishment.

He knows his restaurants, and an apparent foodie as well.  While in discussion, he momentarily interrupted us as he saw an older guest possibly needing help with her luggage upstairs...didn't mind that at all.

And the washroom: wow, I had thought the Sutton Place's were one of the best.  Marble/granite counters/floors, well lit, and much more spacious stalls ;)  Liked the thick paper napkins too.

1772,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Our room was a standard room - not too big, but sufficient. The room was on the 4th floor and faced into an interior courtyard area where there was a restaurant. Each night the restaurant closed around 10:30 or 11, and was quiet enough that the noise did not bother us until our last night. 

The last night we stayed there was some loud party (playing Backstreet Boys and other great 90's hits) until well into the night and the employees decided it would be a good idea to bring cart load after cartload of clattering dishes through the hall past our room to who knows where, sometimes while talking loudly. 

We called the front and they offered to give us a different room. We were to be up at 4:45 AM for our flight, and we're in no mood to switch rooms (we were now going to get 4 hours of sleep at best). They offered to call the employees to ask them to stop bringing the dishes through the hall and said nothing about the music. They also offered to call me with a follow up. A follow up call is exactly what I want when I am trying to sleep - how about you?

The music got louder - the dishes stopped. 

So, had it not been for a particularly terrible last night I would have given the place 4 stars, but frankly I should not have to call in the middle of the night to ask for a quiet sleep in a hotel.",2018-01-27T07:49:59Z,128

1774,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"I'm not sure who lets me in to nice hotels. The Super 8 gets full pretty quick though, so sometimes I have to resort to other measures. I've only stayed at the Hotel Georgia (Georgia, not California) once, but it was so lovely, I have to share:

Conveniently located in downtown Vancouver, BC, this place has got it going on. From the car valet service, check-in, to the first view of their ""The Shining""-reminiscent chandelier in their lobby, you know it's going to be a pleasant stay.

The rooms were nicely-appointed, complete with one of them ""Nexpresso"" machines. Bad mistake to give me one of those. I made myself cup after cup of tiny espressos and ended up helping the housekeepers clean all the rooms TWICE then crashing out on the soft, comfy bed. To recup for dinner, I dragged myself into the bathroom and was delighted by the shower that streams from the ceiling. Definitely a next bathroom design idea for our house. Our view overlooked the outdoor cabana, which had weird hours? Only open until 3pm. What the deuce? I know it's the Northwest and all, but being covered, I didn't understand why I could not enjoy the cabana at 3:01pm.

The next morning, I wandered down to their gym. It was a bit confusing, but I made it okay--guided by the glowing, color-changing bottom of the pool (sort of art deco meets ""Weird Science"") I doubled back and made my way into a very nice gym. 

Later, we checked out and I have to say that I was sad we only stayed one night, but we were on our way to Tofino, BC! Hang 10 dudes and dudettes! While waiting for our car, I noticed that they use a Bentley for their shuttle van. And pop culture be darned, the first thing I thought of was ""Bennifer's"" matching Bentleys.

1775,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"The Hotel Georgia is one of the most elegant places I've ever stayed at.  It has a bit of a roaring twenties vibe that will blow you away the minute you step into the luxurious lobby full of dark wood and chandeliers.  

Our room was beautiful and had a perfect mix of comfort and technology.  To start with, the bathroom was incredible.  Quite sure we've had rooms in NYC smaller than the bath we had here.  Huge soaker tub, multispout shower, double vanities and lou.  Marble and granite all throughout it.  We slept like babies in the huge bed.  There was a lounge area and also a desk with tons of outlets to plug in gadgets or get some work done.  From a technology perspective, they had a big plasma TV, Bose ipod radio dock and master switches throughout the suite to control lighting in different areas.  I also liked their green efforts with the recycling bin and the master light kill switch by the door.  Those both seem like no brainers that many places overlook.  Instead of a simple hang tag there were switches for housekeeping and do not disturb.  The suite also had an espresso machine, which was a perfect start to each morning.  

The gym was very nice and modern and had plenty of space and equipment.  There is a popular terrace lounge that we never made it too, but seems buzzing.  

Everyone we dealt with was very polite and professional.  Turndown service included cool little cards featuring Kate Hepburn and the Duke celebrating the hotel's storied history.  Valets were prompt with our care and helpful with directions and tips, like that the buses in town have the right of way.  And here I was playing hardball with them.",2012-08-24T15:12:24Z,128

He said that's something you do on your own. I was confused when she mentioned it as my understanding is that's what the Concierge supposed to do for their guests.

The Spanish Ballroom, with lovely moldings on walls and ceiling is just a dream. Our event was top-notch; servers outfitted in those ""50's white sports coats - little nibblies that were fabulously inventive. A tiny pastry bento box (!), petite sliders on choux, beef medallions with fragrant spice; all so lovely. Noticed the black slate trays to keep hots tres chaud. 

Later, up on the roof in the Reflections bar, surrounded by the sound of water; little canals to cross over, waterfalls on the east wall, a fire pit surrounded by stone stools. We hunkered down in a cabana with fluffy warm blankets, as it was early March in Vancouver, still very cool in the evening. 

Cocktails are pricey at $12 and small. The chocolate with giant house made marshmallow was the hit of the evening; my Pink Lady was a tad pale and thin - this is a drink that requires a slow hand to bring it to perfection. I'll stick to the bar menu next time.

The bar is next to the salt water lap pool, which cried out to be swum in. Looking up into the dark night while sipping cocktails with fine friends makes for a might fine evening.

Wish I could say the same about the hotel staff and policies. Three main issues:

1) Within 10 minutes of entering my room with a colleague, a member of the hotel staff walked into the room without knocking, ringing the bell or announcing herself. Just walked straight in, saw us, and walked out. No comment. 
2) when I travel, I like to have work in progress so I frequently leave the do not disturb/privacy light on. In spite of this, my room was entered, cleaned, and my papers moved. BS. I was so upset at this violation. In 20 years of travel, I have never had this happen, particularly at a five star hotel. When I initially questioned this, the hotel staff member told me it was their policy. I was later contacted by a manager who apologized and stated that the policy would be reviewed, but this alone should warn any future guests who value their privacy. 
3) adding insult to injury, the hotel attempted to  charge me for mini-bar expenses. 

Bottom line, I was contacted by a floor manager, not the GM, despite my request. This is not what I consider 5-star service. The Four Seasons is across the street. I would recommend sending the management and staff over for some additional hospitality industry training.",2015-06-20T22:48:23Z,128

Can someone please get back to me soon, please? Thanks!

April 28 Update: Ha, these guys are awesome. They replied to my post below, and they called up one of my friends thinking she was me. They were probably annoyed since one of us Facebooked them, I Yelped them, and another called them. So sorry for the confusion, I had no idea the others were reaching Rosewood at the same time. Anyway all has ended well, one of the birthday party members picked up the item yesterday.

Ok, back to my review: The patio is gorgeous, just make sure you go during warm weather. We went on a cold and windy night and the heater above us was broken, so we were pretty cold. I hope they get that heater fixed!  The waitress was very nice and brought our table blankets even though we didn't ask for them, she just noticed the people were cold. The atmosphere is great for photo taking. The rooftop patio has an urbanesque feel with water on the floor and a small waterfall on the wall. It's hard to explain, but if you google ""Reflections Lounge at Rosewood Hotel"", you'll see what I mean. It's beautiful and classy. The staff was so kind, different staff members were offering to take group photos for us even though we didn't ask. One of our friends took up the bill and I told him to please tip at least 18% or higher because the staff was so accommodating, so I hope he did!

First of all, service here is impeccable. Second to none. I am comparing Rosewood Georgia with Four Seasons, Ritz, Palace and other 5 star hotels and Rosewood truly is untouchable.  Rosewood is a boutique style hotel where they make you feel like royalty. All the staff address you by your name! And they are all very helpful. My wife was carrying 2 cups of coffee and one of the staff assisted by keeping the elevator door opened and pushing the button so she didn't have to put the coffee down.  I never had to wait for my car more than few minutes for valet. They also have a complementary Bentley service to drop you off anywhere in downtown Vancouver. I can gush on and on about the service but you get the picture. 

Now for the room. When we first walked in the room, there was a hand written note by one the staff welcoming us with chocolate. Nice touch! The rooms are serviced twice a day and they are elegant and clean. Bathrooms are very roomy and even had a soaking tub. I can open the window for fresh air which is important to me. Free internet.  The view I had was the Pacific Center and Vancouver Art Gallery.  And the beds here are super comfortable.  I can't remember sleeping this good at a hotel.

The bellman opened our cab door and said, ""We are prepared to pamper you"", who wouldn't love that to be the first thing they hear? Unfortunately, we only spent the night, but it was a very comfortable night. The service was spectacular and the rooms had everything you could need...including a Nespresso machine.

1792,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"I was felt lucky enough to stay 1 night at the Rosewood, but holy cow, I felt like royalty there!  We stayed in a nice King suite, with a crazy bathroom!  Large tub, and waterfall shower, with 2 separate sinks and mirrors.  The shampoos and lotions were supplied by CO Bigelow, and smelled so good.  The floors were heated too, which was a amazing!  The only thing with the bathroom that I wasn't too fond of, was that the separate toilet stall was kind of open, the doors were frosted around it, and it was just a swinging door, not completely sealed off, which could have potential for some embarrassing moments!  

We had a great view of the VAG.  Everyone was incredibly nice, and they even have a car service for you to anywhere in DT!  We were supposed to get the Bentley, but it was in the shop so we had a BMW instead (not too shabby ;) )

We also went for a nice relaxing 80-minute massage, and it was beautiful in there.  Aside from the massage, the sheets there were the best part! They said it was made from some sort of bamboo blend, but it was amazing.  

Anyhow, this will cost you a pretty penny, but if you ever decide to splurge and treat yourself, this is the hotel to be at.  There's a lot of character there, and the (original) elevators were so nice.  Would love to stay here again!",2015-03-26T02:01:47Z,128

Couple minor issues:  shower curtain in women's bathroom at the pool was missing; it was hard to get away from loud kids at the pool (all times of the day); folks at concierge desk did not seem familiar with performing arts schedule; and staff pleasantries often seemed forced and robotic.  Also, rooms facing the restaurant are noisy until 10:30 p.m.

1802,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"I love Vancouver, it's my favorite big city after London.  We've stayed at the Wedgewood, Fairmont Pacific Rim, and a forgettable Hilton during past visits.  The Rosewood blew them away, in every sense of the word.

We had a King Suite facing inside towards the Bank next door.  Absolute quiet in the middle of downtown?  Surreal, and so relaxing.  Others have covered the wonderful quality of the hotel and the excellent staff.  Without doubt the most comfortable place we've stayed in BC.  They had a half off deal online for their suites so it was actually no more $$$ than the aforementioned.  I felt we had found the ultimate Vancouver hotel thanks to my fellow Yelpers.

We had room service the last night we were there, and I frankly enjoyed it more than the restaurant downstairs.  

My grandson loved the pool and the changing colors in the lights.  If you look up in the area where you drop off cars you'll see the glass parts of the pool above.  Trippy.

On the subject of driving, if you are unfamiliar with the property your GPS may put you on W. Georgia St.  and to get to drop off your car there is a ""one way"" alley just between the hotel and the Bank next door (south).  Just take that alley and you will find the car drop off easily.  You could also do the same thing on the other side, if you miss it.  The first time may be a little confusing with the downtown traffic, but after that you'll have no problems.

Next door is the huge shopping mall with a food court below.  If you are in need of cheap comfort food there's a good japanese place with excellent udon soup for $8 in the food court there.  And you can buy your lottery ticket next door, so that you can afford a month at the Rosewood when you win, because this will be an excellent place to celebrate.

We did have issues with the wireless there.  My XP notebook could not get on wireless, so they provided a cable.  Our ipad and two iphones had fairly consistent troubles getting on.  Also they would like you to pay $15 or so a day for an upgraded internet experience.  This is one of my pet peeves;  just raise the room price $2 and upgrade everyone's experience instead;  it is unbecoming of such an excellent hotel to be charging extra for a slight speed increase online.  Pandora worked fine on regular internet;  I didn't try streaming video.

The staff were friendly, professional, and seemed genuinely concerned with making our stay excellent.  This speaks well of management and training, as well as employee satisfaction.  I have found my dream hotel in Vancouver.  Mahalo.",2013-10-26T18:22:07Z,128

1804,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"Rosewood Hotel Georgia is an old hotel with an updated look but not a modern feel. The lobby is mid-weigh modern with a grand chandelier and upstairs bar, but not truly an ""art"" spectacular. The front desk check in was satisfactory, but did not make you feel special. The room was very basic but satisfactory. The bed was very comfortable, lighting was excellent and the TV was a reasonable size. Unfortunately, the desk and chair were not up to standards even for a moderate businesses user. It felt small and the chair lacked support and comfort. 

The bathroom was just OK. The bath products (soap and shampoo) were of the lowest quality and really lacked a refreshing smell and feel. Concerning the shower, it is really personal preference as it has the ceiling style water production system. Although some might like this, I felt it lacked water pressure and just wasn't relaxing. I do give credit to the hotel for maintaining solid hot water during peak hours mind you. To that end, each day I was staying at the hotel around 3 or 4am the water pipe/hammer made loud noise waking me up the majority of the time. I was told by staff that this noise was the heating system getting ready for the day's use. Not good.

The concierge service was extremely mixed. On the one hand, they were pleasant and helpful but on the other hand had little knowledge of good restaurants and more importantly the hours of operations related to certain tourist destinations. The latter was extremely frustrating as the venue that they recommended to me was closed and thus my leisure day and money went to waste. It is critical that a good concierge know the hours of operations, nuances and little details about tourist destinations before they recommend the site to hotel guests. Therefore, a training program in this regard may need to be orchestrated to improve service and insight. 

Overall, I have experienced better hotels for the money. I liked the location and the bed but many other hotels and their people do things better in the customer service realm. I wish them much luck.

Good luck in Vancouver.",2014-02-01T16:17:09Z,128

I made sure I got the room with the large luxurious soaker tub (my bathtub obsession don't ask me why) so we booked the Deluxe Room ($500-600). The spacious room came with earthy tones, views of the city (although my view wasn't magnificent) there was very little to complain about. The service was great; I was craving for some poutine so they drove us in their complimentary car service, ahem Bentley to meet my needs. They sure know how to make you feel like a royalty here. Like I said, I was here for a wedding, so I didn't get to fully discover myself in the hotel.. does that mean I will be waddling my way back soon? Hell yesss.",2017-01-18T06:01:52Z,128

1807,Rosewood Hotel Georgia - Temp. CLOSED,4.4,"I stayed at the Rosewood Georgia from August 31 to September 3 in a Deluxe King Room. Room number 610. The valets were very courteous and helpful with unloading. Additionally they inquire if we would be using the car later that evening so they could keep it in the front. Check-in was extremely smooth and they offer an assortment of perfume and cologne at the front desk just in case if yours was confiscated at the airport. The room was extremely well done and the bathroom was large for a non-suite room. There is an outdoor lounge/bar situated on the fourth floor, due to outdoor noise regulations they close at 11pm.

Pros:
- Attentive valets, they offer maps, directions, bottled water and are willing to help in any way
- Large bathroom with a separate tub and shower
- Lobby bar has a large assortment of bitters to make very unique cocktails (try maple syrup old fashioned)
- Rooms are well laid out
- Downtown location is convenient with shopping next door and a museum across the street  

Cons:
- Beware of wedding parties held on the 2nd floor. Fortunately guests have to use a keycard to gain access to their respectable floors
- Swimming pool is somewhat shallow for individuals over 6 feet but will work for a few laps.

Recommendations:
- Talk to the valet about things to do and grab a map and some water
- Try to get a high floor (above the 4th) if you do not want the noise from the outdoor bar to bother you.
- Try some cocktails at the lobby bar.",2012-10-18T04:57:33Z,128

This place oozes luxury and elegance without the snooty 'tude that accompanies a lot of ""boutique"" type hotels around Vancouver.

The service at the lounge bar was impeccable. The staff is amazingly accommodating and helpful, the quality of the drinks were top-notch and the food... I can't even begin to describe the food. The quality of the ""pub-fare"" grade bacon-wrapped scallops was possibly the best I've ever had in Vancouver. (YES! Better than at the Cannery or Coast).

Mark went above and beyond. He personally walked the passports in a secure package to a float plane down at the Harbour in Vancouver.

The rooftop establishment where we spent the bulk of our party time was second to none in it's design. Half of the venue was covered (including the bar, comfy couches, dining tables), and half was outdoors and included a crossable stream, pathways and a waterfall! Drinks were on the pricey side but that was to be expected considing they have to pay for top end decor and waitstaff. Bartenders knew how to make a wicked martini as well!

The city is lively and safe, and we felt comfortable walking to and from the hotel even late at night. As for service, we couldn't have asked for more (the front desk sent us a bottle of champagne when they found out it was our anniversary).  Everyone was exceptionally helpful, particularly everyone at the concierge desk and the bell men. The concierge gave us detailed suggestions for places to go and excellent restaurants. They helped us book out travel to Victoria as well. The housekeepers were very thorough amd even left me a lens cleaner when they saw my glasses. Last but not least, Jim, the wonderfully friendly and knowledgeable driver, will take you wherever you need to go (just book him in advance). Finally, the room was beautiful, spacious, and looked out upon the Vancouver Art Museum (we didn't have any trouble with noise). We would most certainly stay there again!

Pros:
#1: close proximity to English Bay and #1 rated Stanley Park.  Within walking distance to many restaurants.  Stanley Park has Brewery that is within 5 minute walking distance from the Inn.   
#2: free parking spaces (3) in the back if space is available.  must request ahead of time.  
#3: very romantic, cozy setting with lots of furnishings to go with name like English Bay Inn.  Had port wine with several glasses to use.
#4: Yes, the breakfast and the friendly staff serving you in the morning.  The staff is very personable and paid attention to details.  

Cons:  #3 being the smallest, we did not have enough room to open the suitcase fully but somehow managed it.  If you are big, you will definitely hate this room.

Overall, we will definitely stay again and recommend to others",2019-08-12T21:01:16Z,10
1822,English Bay Inn,4.9,"This is the cutest Bed & Breakfast inns ever.  It's nestled between a lot of tall apartment buildings, hiding a bit as a little treasure should.  We just checked out, and during this time of the year (May) there are beautiful flower blooms and weather to go with the charming house.

My parents booked unit 6, the attic.  My husband, son, my brother and I had unit 5, the basement.  For Unit 6, you enter into a seating area, then go up another flight of stairs to another small seating area, the bed area and a pretty good sized bathroom.  Our basement until (in photos) has a small kitchen, small dining room, and two sleeping areas.  My brother was with us just one night so he took the back bedroom, and when he left our son took the bedroom.  With either situation the basement was enough room for us.  If you are visiting with a child, I'd recommend booking the basement to keep the rest of the house quiet for the other guests.  

The only downside for the basement unit is that you don't get the wonderful breakfast with it.  My parents and my husband and I switched off going to breakfast on different mornings since the attic unit does include breakfast.  They thoroughly enjoyed their omelet breakfast and declared that we'll enjoy our turn the next day - and we did enjoy it this morning!  We had muffins, fruit salad, and delicious Eggs Benedict with corned beef, small salad, sprouts and grilled tomatoes.  A gentleman sitting in front of me had the omelets the day before and asked for fruit and cereal instead today, and they happily supplied him with what he asked for.

The house is obviously an older house.  It's nothing like staying at a brand new five star hotel, but you can say that's all part of the charm of it.  When I visit Vancouver again, I plan to book with them again as long as they have availability.

The Inn is also very nicely located.  You can walk a short block down to the bay and take a nice walk one way to Stanley Park (the entrance is one block north), or walk south to a popular beach and restaurant area.  If you are driving, make sure to request a reserved parking space (there are only 3).

I'm a fan, and if you enjoy character and supporting small quality businesses with caretakers who want to make your trip enjoyable, book with them!",2018-05-12T21:24:23Z,10

1825,English Bay Inn,4.9,"I was looking to surprise my husband with a great B&B for an anniversary getaway, and after doing a ton of research I finally decided on EBI based on all the fantastic reviews...

First off, my initial impression was fantastic based on Greg's level of quick communication and accommodating my requests. Our Saturday arrived and we finally had the true pleasure of meeting Greg and checking into this beautiful Bed and Breakfast. 

We were shown to our room (we chose the upper suite) and it was absolutely gorgeous! A whole sitting room on the lower level to ourselves and flat screen TV, and up the stairs to another sitting area, fireplace, big comfy bed, and beautiful bathroom with a big jacuzzi tub. Everything was so warm and welcoming, with soft lighting all throughout and quiet classical music playing in the dining/welcome area.

Honestly what really makes the entire experience so memorable is Greg. He was so attentive and helpful, you can tell he really loves what he does. He cooked an absolutely fantastic breakfast for us...a beautiful fresh fruit plate to start, fresh fluffy cheese scones and fresh baked cookies, and home made smoked salmon or turkey bacon eggs benedict. Accompanied with tea, coffee, and orange juice, and fabulous conversation at breakfast!

All in all our weekend getaway was so fun and romantic, we couldn't have asked for anything more...well other than an extra night or two! We cannot wait to have another excuse to head over to Vancouver and stay here again alone or even with some friends!

Perfect Location: you can hold your breath and walk to the waterfront to catch sunset, Stanley Park for a stroll, and Denman Street for drinks and dinner.
Quaint and comfy room: we stayed in the king room - two floors, two sitting areas, fireplace, and large bathroom. Room was cozy and bed was super comfortable. I don't typically sleep well on vacation but this was an exception.
Breakfast: AMAZING. Wish I could have stayed longer just to see what other delicious entrees Alberto had planned for the week.",2016-04-19T04:46:44Z,10

The neighborhood is a little sketchy but once you realize the large homeless population that resides in the surrounding blocks are harmless, it is definitely worth it. The hotel is not too far from everything else and is actually an incentive to not stick around in your room all day. When you travel somewhere, you should be out and about, not cooped up in your hotel room!

Not only is this hotel located on one of the most disgusting streets in Vancouver but it's FILLED with drug addicted homeless. They wander all over the place outside the hotel and one came inside while we were checking in; it made us feel extremely unsafe. DO NOT walk around at night. Ambulance and police sirens can be expected to be heard every 30 minutes stopping along the street to attend to the seemingly endless amount of homeless people.

1837,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"I was booking a trip to Vancouver for the weekend, and researched a lot of hotels that were within walking distance of attractions and Rogers Arena. In the end, I chose Patricia Hotel, but I cannot remember why. The building is cool and has a very vintage feel to it. The ""deluxe"" queen room was still insanely small. There was no fridge, no coffee maker, the coffee in the lobby cost $2 from a machine, to borrow a hair dryer costs, parking costs, and the little soaps and shampoos are... little. The shower was in a big tub, and the way the curtains went caused it to leak out the front. The bathroom is really big for some reason. There was a large tube TV and AMC was on Eastern Time for some reason, so we accidentally saw Walking Dead spoilers. Warn a girl, you know.

The worst part about this hotel is outside. There are swarms of homeless people, prostitutes (who are not even trying to hide it), and drug deals going on. Walking around, people offered us crack repeatedly. The prostitutes wore a coat (maybe nothing under) and thigh highs. It was so cold and rainy, so they looked even more miserable than you would imagine a prostitute who services homeless people usually would. The police drove by as if none of this was happening, but if they wanted to do anything, it would take forever, so I kind of get it. It felt dangerous, and the hotel told us we could pay $10 to park on the lot, which was safer than the street... but there was a camp of crack dealers and users right behind the lot. Also, as I left on the last day, there was a sawed off broom handle just in the lot. 

The hotel looks out onto dirty buildings and streets full of people huddled under umbrellas. The lobby smelled like someone had farted themselves to death and the room smelled like cheap air freshener. The bed was hard as a rock and the stream radiator made weird noises in the evening. So... so much for a romantic getaway. I did bring back two large, mysterious bug bites from the trip, though. Free souvenirs?!",2017-03-14T14:31:21Z,72

- cheap 

Con for hotel:
- dirty
- carpets covered in stains and did not look vacuumed
- bathroom was dirty & moldy 
- bedding was stained 
- bedding was dirty I pulled back the sheets and there was hair and other fibers in the bed. 
- remote was broken and sticky 

Needless to say I never took off my shoes kept my bags on top of a table & slept fully clothes. I slept for about 4 hours and checked out early so that I could go to the station. I spent $100 to stay in a hotel for 5 hours. That stay was worth $20

""Oh. wow. Hey I guess this is it.""

""Wait. Is that a HOoKer coming over to our car???""
*Yep. It was. She was joined at the hip by her PIMP. and, moments later, an old dude on a bicycle picked her up, put her on his handles and took her back to his lair*

Kinda noisy at night, there must be a club or venue nearby. 

There's wifi but it's VERY spotty and slow.

As for the neighborhood, no worse than any ""good"" part of California, ie there's just a lot of homeless roaming around. I went on two runs during my one day stay and didn't feel unsafe. No one spoke to me. There's just a lot of them sleeping in the park a block down. Plus, the really cute trendy area is like a 2 block walk.",2015-05-29T21:11:46Z,72

Now, the Patricia Hotel is great place to stay if you are ""balling on budget"", and just need a room to sleep in. The staff is nice and very helpful.  

My friend and I stayed at Patricia Hotel this past weekend and shared a budget room. The room consists of 1 full size bed, a private bathroom with a shower, and a 13 inch TV. 

Now, the location is not as bad as the other reviewers make it seem. If you live in a big city and are used to seeing homeless people, then this area is not too bad. The bums/crackheads are not aggressive in their pan handling like Seattle bums. They (bums) at least try to sell you some goods if you are looking at their items. 

My only gripe about this place was the lack of Wi-Fi access in our room. The hotel does offer free Wi-Fi, but the signal strength is not that great. We were staying on the 5th floor, and had to be in the lobby to use it.",2010-10-25T23:17:45Z,72

I reserved this place online because it was literally my only choice.
Everything was booked up for Gay Pride weekend, and this was a spur of the moment trip. 
The price was right, and the online photos looked nice.

It was around midnight that we arrived, after a long drive from Portland.
We were tired and wanted to relax.

As we approached the hotel, there was a couple in the middle of the street, blocking the parking lot for our hotel. They were having a Meth fueled brawl.
I honked my horn and flickered my lights, but didn't get a reaction from them.
I was beginning to think the apocalypse happened, they looked like zombies! 
I looked around and there were quite a few of the ""undead"" walking around the building.  Mommy! 

After a few minutes, the fight moved on. I nervously parked our car in the lot adjacent to the hotel. 

I was scared.

We walked into the lobby and was greeted warmly by the guys working the front desk. 
I asked them if it was safe to park my car in the lot and they motioned to a surveillance camera that was trained on the lot.  They told me not to leave anything in my car. 
That wasn't very comforting to me.

We finished checking in, and went back to the car to unload our bags.
A few of the undead were sitting on my hood of my car.
I asked him to get up, and thankfully they obliged.

The lobby looked exactly like the photos online. I love old buildings, and riding the elevator up to our room reminded me of an old apartment building that I used to live in my 20's.

The room was alright. I've seen worse. 
The beds were comfortable, but I couldn't sleep.
I kept hearing a commotion outside the window. I looked outside and saw crack whores picking up their Johns, and drug addicts walking around. 
I can deal with a lot, but not being  able to go outside at night is a dealbreaker. 

The whole experience had me depressed. I could feel the unhappiness of the people outside my window. The vibe was terrible. Not my idea of a vacation. 
We had booked the room for 3 days , and I was at odds.
 I went to the lobby and let the gentleman know my feelings. 
They refunded the following 2 days, without hesitation. That was one of the easiest transactions in my life. Thank you ! 

The next morning, although the area looked different in the daylight,  I  called a travel agent. 
She found us a room in a lovely hotel located in a desirable neighborhood, for our second evening.
The price was more then double, but worth every penny. 

The 3rd night we rented an apartment at the University. 
It was a short drive and not in the downtown core at all, but it introduced us to another part of Vancouver, and I fell in love. 

You really do get what you pay for.

The walls are cracked and poorly patched.... 

The positives: the fan in the room works, the TV works (remote doesn't), no evidence of bugs, shower, sink, and toilet included in your room. The man at the desk was polite and helpful. The building is historic and I love the look of the decor in the lobby. It has a small library downstairs and lots of seating.

1848,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"Close-in, cheap and basic. These are the three words I would choose to describe the Patricia. Yes, the road it's on (Hastings) is THE homeless street of Vancouver, so just walk a block over to Pender and you'll be on the main Chinatown street, or alternately, choose the other direction one block over where you'll be on the main Gastown street. That's all you have to do (or get a taxi) to avoid the homeless/drug addicts/prostitutes. 

There was one evening we were walking back late when we thought we might get mugged. We didn't, thankfully. 

There were two instances where we encountered prostitutes. One, we were across from the hotel and a woman was very openings you saying, ""Sex? Blowjob?"" on repeat. The other, was when my husband was out smoking one morning, he was approached and asked if he wanted a date. 

The hotel is mostly clean... There was debris around a radiator in our room that looked like it hadn't been cleaned in awhile. No bed bugs were found (I looked). The TV is old and small, but worked. A continental breakfast was included and that was nice! Be sure to have the interior of your car free of goodies or rubbish if you're parking ($10/day) here.

- theres a dive bar past the lobby where some of the older guests were getting pretty lit
-parking is $10 overnight which was great
-literally a 3 minute drive to gastown/ would probably be like a 20 minute walk if its not raining, they dont have UBER in BC so plan ahead!

No water pressure & the stream pointed only at one wall, making it impossible to get clean at all. A car next to ours had their window smashed.

AREA:
It was a road trip with a pit stop in Vancouver- on our budget, this place seemed fine enough. Immediately, the surrounding area seemed sketchy, but we were not prepared for how insanely populated (many blocks worth) by sick, drug addicted, homeless people this area was until we tried to naively walk downtown. After two or three blocks, we turned back around to drive instead. It was sick and sad and gross as hell. Everyone else has commented on this fact and I'm just reiterating the point. Dirty streets, loud seagulls in the morning, and more run down than any other street in the city.

ROOMS:
The room is laughable! It's something like ten by ten, old as balls, and sad. The bathroom door is accordion style and cannot close all the way all while being one foot from the literal bed. Sink is outside. I wish I was kidding. We felt trapped in this hole for the rest of our stay, but after reading reviews to calm my doubts I felt I could bite my tongue and tough it out for the rest of the stay... that is, until the morning.

THE KICKER:
I woke up and realized we had been bitten by BED BUGS! I cried as this was the last straw (and my only encounter with something so damn nasty). We both had bites and after looking up bed bug info online, the proof was in the pudding (a small blotch of blood on the bed and bites on our backs and legs) I convinced my husband enough to pack up our sh*t and get the hell out. Downstairs, Noor was trying to be helpful, but the blonde woman who looks like Pam from the office and the maid staff were accusatory and unapologetic. They were angry at US, rude, and pointed to spiders and mosquitoes. They did not refund our night's stay, but did so for the other two. I am now paranoid as hell and incredibly upset. This is my first review on Yelp- but I felt they deserved it.

How this joint maintains its credibility or name in the running truly boggles me. I would not have said a peep and carried on my merry way had the bed bugs not been an issue- but unless you're a gambling (wo)man and dead serious about your budget- ""AVOID, AVOID, AVOID THIS HOTEL!"" Its not worth it. I fully expect the staff to comment and they can shove it those jerks. NOTHING they say is worth the experience.

Rest assured that the worst part of it is a couple of blocks away from the hotel. Just don't walk toward downtown on Hastings and you won't have to deal with it. Yes, you'll run into some homeless people or otherwise inhibited personalities, but just mind your own business and you'll be good. It's not nearly as bad as some of these reviews make it out to be. 

WHY SHOULD YOU STAY HERE?! It was cheap, centrally located, a block away from Chinatown. There were bus stops within a block, so you don't have to walk far to move about the city. Our room was small and simple but clean and even had a nice view! It was a little noisy, but you're downtown and there's a perpetual party outside. It was nothing that prevented us from getting a good nights rest. Request a room on west side of the building on top floor for view of the water and north Vancouver. There's free wi-fi but you have to wander for the sweet spot and free continental breakfast. The people at the front desk were really helpful.

If you are from a big city in the US, this probably will not phase you. People on the street left us alone for the most part. If they did engage us, it was polite and non aggressive. At no time did I feel unsafe, even in the middle of the night. I was more worried about stepping in dog excrement on the sidewalk than anyone bothering me. This is something I cannot say about being in any big city in the US. 
With that out of the way, the staff of the Patricia are charming, helpful, and even funny. The room was very small and modest, but clean & we slept comfortably. They turn up the radiator at night, but there was a fan in the room that kept it very comfortable. It wasn't loud at all. We were on the top floor and there were no pests, no bugs, no weird smells, etc. For urban folks looking for a charming & inexpensive stay in Vancouver, this is a great option. If you need privacy from your roomate, maybe ask about bigger rooms. If you are a single or very close couple though, the budget room will probably suffice. Very easy to get to and from YVR and most points in the city by bus/skytrain/cab. The only weird thing was the cranky elevator. But they have stairs too. 

There is a pub as well, which I did not check out. 

There was a big dog behind the counter, but I didn't smell her. She didn't make any noise. She didn't seem too interested in hotel guests either.

Firstly, did you know that hookers work in some of the rooms?
No website mentions this!
I'm not lying.
Go ask people that live in Vancouver.
Maybe check chat rooms!
Talk to real people, not websites!
Even booking agencies might lie!

A taxi driver, who is also an anti-terrorist, gave me this information.
This is a red flag place and if you are a female, it makes you look bad.
Especially if you come to Canada alone and book this hotel.
Even men, you may look suspicious of looking for prostitution possibly. 

You have a HIGH chance of getting stopped at immigration and asked questions.

Whenever I mention the name of this hotel, everyone freezes and their eyes turn dark.
Don't go here!
It's cheaper but not worth the trouble...

Cheaper isn't always better.
And in this case, it's a TRAP.

Vancouver residents know this and I have personally asked many people.
Be safe.

My friend and i got the Basic. One bed, smallish bathroom, sink by the door of the room outside the bathroom, tv.. But seriously, for $59, not going to complain. We barely even used the room. It was mainly storage for luggage, anything we bought, and for sleep at the end of the day. The rest of the time, we were out and about.

as for the area, it's Chinatown. Chinatown is usually always in the oldest/older part of any city. So of course it will look a bit on the dirtier/crappy side.. 

The bums/drug addicts/prostitutes walking around.. yes i saw them. In the morning and at night. We walked to downtown from the area at 8-9ish so it's not like you can't go out in that area of night without being shot or mugged.. the most they will do is ask for a Quarter, then you give them one or say ""sorry, no change"" and they move on. They are not aggressive. (not that i've experienced.) I was sitting in the lobby when a bum came in with his dog yelling out for where the bar is or something. There's a pub connected to the hotel so i thought he was looking for that, so to be nice I told him the pub was next door. All he did was just say sorry, ok, and leave.

Wifi. UGH there's Wifi ALL OVER but it's allllllllll crappy unless you're int he lobby. So be prepared to take a trip down there to plan any trips/yelp places/email/ etc.

Service is also nice.",2011-06-20T13:30:49Z,72
1859,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"This weekend, $39 dollars a night was perfect. 

We had a comfortable full size bed, small TV with cable, hot water with strong pressure, a quiet night's sleep, friendly staff, and exposure to the other side of Vancouver. My car parked in the lit lot next door was just fine for 3 days. I thoroughly checked for bedbugs- nada. I brought earplugs but didn't use them. Walking on Hastings was not too scary an experience; you're soon in the gentrified Gastown. 

The bottom line: we are young, came with no expectations, are tolerant of small spaces, are not particularly offended by the presence of sex workers, and weren't going to be hanging out in the room. 

I would stay again!",2012-02-21T18:42:35Z,72
1860,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"Want to know what its like to live in Skid Row?

Place was so bad, I ended up staying at a different hotel even after paying for our room.

I'm no stranger to bad areas. I grew up in Van Nuys, i'm used to prostitutes and crack heads in LA. I've driven by our skid row without any worries of getting mugged. However I would never in my right mind stay a night there.

Sadly a few yelpers giving this anything but 1 star have failed me. So has priceline for even offering this place. I expected motel 6 quality probably even worse. Budget Inn was no where near as ""great"" of a place.

Still not convinced? Here's a Wiki to the area: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Eastside

""The Downtown Eastside has a high incidence of HIV infection. Vancouver's drug problem has grown steadily worse over the last decade""


I know, the price and the close proximity to the nicer areas of downtown Vancouver are VERY tempting. However, your safety/peace of mind is worth a lot more than $20-40 + a slightly longer drive/walk.

Which reminds me, if you have a car you will have constant fears of your car being ok. Apparently, Vancouver has a huge issue with car break-ins(we were initially informed by a paper in the elevator). Their ""parking lot"" doesnt feel secure at all. The bar's doors open to it. Its also part of an alley. Any ""normal"" neighborhood this would be ok. In the heart of skid row where you're probably known to be a tourist, its an open invite.",2012-06-30T23:34:17Z,72

The walls were so paper thin, you can literally hear every conversation in the building. I couldn't sleep all night. My first trip to Vancouver (May 2008) was cut short by a day because I could not stand sleeping there for another night. I couldn't find another hotel so I just rescheduled my flight home. It was that bad.

- Location ( near downtown but please read my Cons)
-Comfy beds ( see my cons)
-Parking for $10 a day

Cons:  * Worst neighborhood: This is the worst neighborhood ever, so depressing, hookers, drug-addicts, homeless everywhere you look around. Let don't engage with you tho, you can walk at  night and during the day and they won't even try to talk to you ( at leas my experience) but if you are a SOLO FEMALE traveling, please DON'T stay here, it is a very very very very unpleasant neighborhood.  
* It is not the cleanest room but not the dirtiest either",2017-05-03T21:46:44Z,72
1863,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"I will put it this way... 

The hotel is pretty nice but the neighborhood really isn't. 
3 stars for the hotel, 1 star for the location 

Honestly I cannot complain too much about this place because it has free wifi, a ton of channels on the television and the bed was really comfortable. Moreover the staff was very friendly and I got the impression that this is a family run operation which in my book is a plus. The building is from a different era and as such the rooms are fairly small by modern standards but don't let that deter you from staying here. It is not like one needs a whole lot of space to set their stuff down, surf the web and sleep. The elevator is really old and kind of fun to ride.
 
Given the neighborhood this spot might best be used as a home base for day trips because once night falls you won't really want to go out exploring much. There is a parking lot though, so you could feasibly drive wherever you want in the city and then just come back and make the 30ft dash towards the entrance if you think a little fun is worth the risk.  Just kidding......kinda...

Anyway, the Budget Inn-Patricia Hotel is perfect for the non-picky type and to be honest they didn't seem to be hurting for business so they must be doing something right.",2010-08-10T19:01:48Z,72
1864,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"Be aware that this is a very basic budget hotel, and that what you pay for is what you get.

Though we appreciated the money that this place saved us for our two-night stay, the reasons we would reconsider staying here again are as follows:
- My husband and I were staying here on the first leg of our two-week honeymoon, meaning we had a lot of luggage and it felt like we were constantly stepping over our bags because there wasn't a closet or really much floor space.
- The lack of AC and only a desk fan meant that the room was sweltering in the late afternoon. This was fine for me, but my husband found the high temperature to be unpleasant, so we tried to stay out of our room other than to sleep. The open window meant that a nice breeze would circulate, but though I didn't see a single bug, I found it alarming that there was no screen.
- The bathroom is a bona fide converted closet, meaning there is no fan to circulate air and the door is an accordion-style wooden thing that may or may not have a gap in the middle (didn't in our case but did in the case of our friends' room). Let's just say you should try to time your number two for when you're leaving the room and won't be back for the rest of the day.
- The free Wi-Fi that they advertise does not in reality reach all of the rooms and is only most reliable in the lobby, where large numbers of people have a tendency to congregate in the evenings.
- Supposedly this hotel is located in a ""bad"" neighborhood, which is not something we minded. However, it was a little sad that we were told not to go out walking at night. But no issues walking to public transit during the day.

The one nice surprise is that they have a solid continental breakfast. Unfortunately not great for plant-based eaters like me, but I brought my own food.",2016-08-27T04:20:15Z,72
1865,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"Service here is fantastic and the staff was always ready to answer a question or solve a problem. The pub downstairs was also great and we loved getting to have a beer without leaving the hotel and needing a cab home! The area was as sketchy as most reviews say it is. The hotel is just not in the the best part of town, not somewhere I would recommend staying alone, or if you plan to be out after dark. The homeless population in this area is in most cases harmless but it is important to be careful in the area past dark because we did see some shady things. As a young woman I did feel uncomfortable walking in the area during the day and night so I did end up spending more money on cabs than anticipated which in the end probably meant the discount prices of the room were canceled out, but oh well! The room itself was very small, my college dorm room was bigger! The bathroom was clean though and house keeping came everyday to keep our space clean and replace our towels. I would consider staying here again due to the price and the location is better than some, but if you're planning on going out at night, consider something in a better part of town because you will end up paying more money for transportation than you'll expect.",2018-04-09T12:26:59Z,72

The minute we arrived to the neighborhood where Budget Inn Patricia Hotel was located we saw buildings that were vandalized, an abundance of homeless people walking around, and drug deals going on behind the building of the hotel and across the hotel. Not that I have anything against homeless people, however I still felt uncomfortable when a homeless person walked into the hotel requesting access to a room where someone was supposedly waiting for him. As a young female, I didn't feel safe. I quickly began to see the neighborhood as a barrier for exploring Vancouver after sundown. I don't recommend this room to anyone. I suggest Expedia rethink where they are sending their clients to.",2017-12-13T00:47:08Z,72
1867,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"I very much enjoyed my stay at the Budget Inn Patricia Hotel. Any place you pay only 70+/night for 2 people is not going to be a five-star resort. You have to know what you're getting yourself into for the price- not expect something exceptional in an incredible area.

The rooms are small but if you're only here to sleep, it's the perfect place.
The staff, specifically Nue/New (I apologize for the spelling) was incredible. He spent a good 10 minutes with me explaining what to see, where to go, and how to get there. We walked 2 blocks and we were able to hop on the bus to Downtown/Granville Island/the Marina and so many more locations.

I will agree that the neighborhood is not the best. It is drug infested and the people can be intimidating if you're not used to this kind of location/experience. If you keep to yourself, no one will bother you.

I would not bring any children here but for adults, the neighborhood is fine.

The room was only going to cost 80 and now they made me pay over 100. This is such bulshit and a complete scan. I would never recommend staying here.

Paper thin walls + bar downstairs + more working girls than you can shake a stick at = be prepared to be woken up to grunts and groans. Kind of awkward but that's what you get for $59 a night. 

All that aside, the hotel really couldn't be in a worse area of town. It seems that every social issue has been swept out of downtown Vancouver to Hastings. Substance abuse, prostitution, mental health issues, victimization and exploitation as far as the eye can see.",2011-08-15T17:55:05Z,72

1875,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"My husband and I had a nice stay. We took a trip to Vancouver together in order to get married (having different citizenships and navigating trough the marriage & immigration laws, we found that was the best). We stayed at the Patricia for 5 nights.

It is generally clean; not perfect,but average, I would say. The rooms are small but that was perfectly fine. What I didn't like is the bathroom; the door was (it seems) that of a closet. It generally didn't bother me too much though. On our (I think?) 3rd day there, the toilet of our room broke. The staff immediately changed us room in order to repair the toilet asap. We had a fridge, freezer, and microwave available, but had to ask the staff to use it, which was OK since the reception is 24h. The elevator is old...it didn't always respond quickly. That was a bit of an annoyance, but not a major problem. I also love the old-fashioned general appearance of the place.

The pub has reasonnable prices and offer some selection of meals. As vegans, we didn't have a whole lot of choices, but were able to have a falafel wrap (we both weren't too hungry, so we shared it together). When we asked the waiter to take out the tzatziki sauce, he immediately asked us if we wanted hummus as a replacement, for no extra charge! that was very much appreciated. He also brought two plates and the wrap was already cut in half; we didn't have to tell him that we were gonna share it. That initiative was also appreciated.

The staff working there is generally not bad, not amazing, but good/average. Well, except for two people. One is an asian woman with short black hair, a bit chubby, who works night shift. She's rude and unhelpful. (I mean, she'll give you what you need, but you can read in her face and her attitude that she'd rather not have anything to do with you!) When I went downstairs at around 1AM to have hot water, I hadn't yet noticed the coffee machine in the lobby, so I was looking for the staff at the reception. No one was there. Turns out she was hanging out in the pub, leaving the reception empty. The doors were locked and people were wanting to check-in, so I had to open the doors for them. When she came back from the pub, I asked her for hot water, so she took a cup, put it in the machine, and poured the hot water. The cup was almost full and I poured oats in it (being hungry at 1AM when everything's closed and you're vegan isn't easy). It was hot water..VERY hot (usually isn't *that* hot when I ask for hot water), so I ended up burning myself and some water-cinnamon oats mixture fell on the ground. She looked at me like I was an idiot before grabbing a towel to clean, but clearly she felt like it was just another f*cking thing to deal with. Before that, when she pressed the elevator button for me, and it went from the basement to the 5th floor without stopping, she said curse words. She's overall very condescending by the way she's like ""let me do everything for you"" but at the same time treating you like you're a piece of shit.

The other exception is a man who told us is name is ""Van"" (might not be spelled that way) who's also Asian. He's on the other side of the spectrum and (thankfully!) makes up for his co-worker's rudeness. He works evening shifts. EXTREMELY FRIENDLY, funny, sociable, helpful! I felt comfortable to tell him or ask him anything and so did my husband. When my husband wanted to buy a bottle of water, but there wasn't any left in the distributing machine, he went to Van, and Van told him ""not to waste a dollar for that!"" and explained him that Vancouver's tap water is actually being sold to other places and comes from a protected source that is not polluted; that it is very good drinkable water. When we would ask him to take our vegan cake from the fridge (a wedding gift from a friend), he would smile and say something along the lines of ""you guys can handle it!"" or ""I'm glad to see you eat that cake, you're both skinny and healthy!"". He's always up for a joke or two or a small conversation and won't hesitate to inform you or help you beyond his duty. He really acts as a friend, but know how to stay professional at the same time. If only all staff was like him, that would be incredibly awesome!

The street in which the hotel is, Hastings, has a lot of homeless, prostitutes, etc., but you can get over it quickly. They never once bothered us (granted, I was accompanied by a 6""3 man...lol). You can go just one street down and avoid it if you need to go somewhere (seriously, it's like you're in a totally different part of town) or you can walk on Hastings, either way, it doesn't seem like you'd be bothered, those people are usually just sitting there, displaying their stuff for sell, or doing crazy things like pretending to be a traffic patrol, but they don't beg for money or anything. Just avoid wandering at night.

The Patricia does look MUCH better than ALL hotels on that street...seriously. Bad area but fairly good place to stay. Love their library!",2015-09-05T06:57:45Z,72
1876,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"Our closet itself wasn't too small--if you've ever stayed in an non-5 star hotel in Paris, it was exactly like that: the room was just big enough to fit a twin bed and a persons legs. At first I thought it didn't have its own bathroom, but it was hidden in what I thought was a closet. It had a tiny (13"") tele with basic cable.

The hotel reeked of cigarettes, and there was a lot of noise/crappy music that seemed to come from the walls.

On the plus side, there was hot water and good water pressure.

On the whole, I'd say just get a hotel downtown (the Barclay on Robson was nice and reasonable), and just book early for a rate that was actually lower than this place, which was in kind of a slum...",2011-12-01T18:06:33Z,72
1877,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,I had bad experience I never had. The hotel is located unsafe place. There are a lot homeless and drunk people around parking lot and outside the building. If you walk a block there are a few hundreds of homeless people on streets and newspaper and paper are everywhere. I did not want check in but the staff said the room was already charged. They did not care you stay or leave once they got money. The elevator did not work properly and every time it was stopped in the middle of floors. There is a sign to show caution but they still let people to use it. The room is small than the picture shown online and everything is very old. Not safe place and facilities. Never recommended to stay this hotel.,2018-08-21T05:30:35Z,72
1878,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"I freaking love this place! Now, the Border Patrol agent had us pretty freaked out coming into town. She explained how it's one of the worst places in Canada. Not Vancouver, but Canada as a whole. Where if you leave anything that looks valuable in your car, even a sweatshirt, it WILL be stolen and sold the next morning on the street. However, this didn't happen to either car, that could also be because we were parked under the security camera in the parking lot.

Anyways! Back to the hotel. Upon walking in, the hotel smells like an antique shop. More than likely because the building itself is an antique. Keep in mind, this building was built in 1913, not 2013. It has character. We stayed three incredibly fun nights here. I work for a large mattress retailer so the first thing I checked for was bed bugs. None to be found. In fact they have a bed bug preventative cover on the mattresses and box springs. Check for that next time you stay anywhere. Between the four of us, zero bites. The rooms don't have any sort of AC besides a standard plug in fan. Again, built in 1913... When we stayed it was about 85* in Vancouver. Close your blinds during the day, open the windows at night. You'll survive. 

We never got a chance to check out Pat's Pub because we were too busy in either Gas Town, Stanley Park or on Granville. All of which are walking distance or a short drive. We walked back to the hotel around 2am and never felt unsafe. Never approached once by any one. Police are often in the area as well, but be smart and stay in a group or at least buddy up. Sure, there is a high rate of HIV of the people there, but unless you plan on shooting up or picking up a prostitute, I don't see why you have to worry about this.

All in all, I'll definitely be staying here again. I love the charm of the building, the gentlemen at the front desk was actually really helpful, the price and location are great, I had an awesome time.",2015-06-10T18:27:32Z,72

There was an older man working the front desk and a girl dressed to the nines behind some curtain directly behind the front desk. I was reading som reviews as I waited for the man to get to me. I seen 'bedbugs' and that was it for me. I asked if my car was safe in the parking lot and he said make sure you take belonging out of it. 

It was between skid row and china town. I didn't feel safe and said 'sorry but I don't think I'll be staying here tonight.' Stayed at the Ramada Inn out in Coquitlam. Much better.",2016-05-02T23:06:30Z,72
1880,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"Being from Atlanta, looking at many reviews of this place makes me giggle. Is this in a shady part of town? For sure. However, I didn't feel unsafe at any time during my stay. There are some colorful characters outside, but none of them so much as spoke to me. I've seen far far worse in the ""good"" part of town in my own fair city, however. I'll remind some of the other reviewers, you can't catch HIV by being around people with HIV...So I'm not sure why it's worth mentioning the HIV infection rate in this part of town. And why do you need air conditioning in your room? The temperature in Vancouver rarely tops 75 degrees. Open up your window, enjoy the sea breeze, and quit complaining. As for the size of the rooms, I recently took a trip to New York City. My room there was half the size of a prison cell, I was taller than the room was long such that I had to sleep diagonally on my twin bed just to fit. I had to share a bathroom with 15 other people on the floor. Compared to that, the rooms at the Budget Inn Patricia are an absolute treat.

The hotel has great rates and it's very clean. The staff are pretty courteous. One guy gave me a hassle about playing the piano one afternoon. Though I must wonder, why would you put a working piano in the lobby if you didn't expect people to play it? I'm a trained keyboardist, so it's not like I was making a bunch of noise. He said it was too loud though. No big deal....I guess just wait for off peak hours before you dare tickle the ivories.

This hotel is located close to public transit and is pretty centrally located to get around the city easily. My one complaint is that the internet here absolutely sucks. Supposedly they have connections for the lobby, the 2nd, and the 4th floor. I'm on the 4th floor and am only able to access the lobby connection. As you might imagine, four floors up and it isn't so good. Be prepared to head to the lobby if you want to access the wireless connection. Even then, it's a little dodgy.

There is a decent bar/pub attached to the hotel. Hotel guests get a 20% discount. It's a great place to go for a drink or bite if you don't feel like heading out of the building. The hotel offers a complimentary breakfast from 7-9 am. Don't get your hopes up though, all you get is cereal, muffins, and coffee. It is very much a continental breakfast. No money out of pocket, so that is worth something.

I will definitely be staying here my next visit to Vancouver. The neighborhood has character. If you want a little insight into the real Vancouver, try this place. If you want a clean room, the Budget Inn Patricia is for you. This hotel is a surprisingly good value for the price.

OFFICIAL YELP RATING OF BUDGET INN PATRICA HOTEL: 1/2 STAR

This was our first night in Canada, and our first ever time in Vancouver. WOW. So we got in at 2:30 am, kind of  a bad time but nothing changed at 10 am. As we turn onto East Hastings, there are about 40 to 50 people per block. Homeless, homeless and drunk, prostitutes, people on many substances. The streets were dirty. I felt like I was in a bad movie. And the freaking taxi guy, who drove like a maniac, dropped me off at the CORNER! WTF? So we hightailed it in. At least they had to buzz us in. The front desk guy was nice, but get this. Hey blows his nose, says ""Sorry, I have a cold"" And then precedes to hand us our key. Seriously, am I on candid camera? Whatever, I want sleep badly. This place was teetering at 2 stars by now, and the room made it 1/2. No air conditioner.Dirty.Run down. Very very in need of a remodel. I understand this is a very old part of town, but a remodel is called that for a reason. Thankfully we didn't pay for this hotel, since it was our honeymoon. If we had, I would have asked for a refund in the morning. Oh the morning. So, I look outside in the morning (by the way, no coffee machine), so see a hooker walking (stumbling) from corner to corner. Sometimes she would sit with her legs out spread, doing something. Terrible terrible part of town. If you look up ""bad areas of vancouver bc"", east hastings is on the list. If the hotel was nice maybe I would give it 2 stars or maybe 3. Oh and I forgot, so in the morning, naturally, I wanted to get the hell out of there as quickly as possible. First, we go to get coffee and the free breakfast they said they had. It was like 3 minutes before they said breakfast ended, but they said they closed up. WTF? They opened it up for us, but very rudely and reluctantly. Then, I had them call us a cab. I don't live in a downtown, so I dont know how all this works. I go outside ready to hop into the damn thing to take me out. We waited inside for about 5 minutes,and outside for 2 minutes too damn long. I was honestly afraid of getting robbed. So I see a cab and hail it, not even sure if I'm doing it right. He pulls over, and I get in. The freaking front desk lady runs out, opens the door and says ""Sir, they already called a cab and this isn't it. The cab is here"". I say ""It doesn't really matter"" She very very rudely says ""Well, you asked me to call you a cab and it does matter"" and slams the door. Okay, please get me out of here now. So, the actual rating of this hotel should be no more than a 1/2 star, because I was given more than a cardboard box to sleep under. NEVER STAY HERE! Go to the Howard Johnson on Gransville. It is like 20-30 dollars more, but  VERY WORTH IT! There is a really good pizza place across the street as well.",2009-08-24T20:48:34Z,72

Instead they offered to order take out for us, but did not provide any take out menus or suggestions. As first time visitors to vancouver we were put off and forced to go try to find somewhere near by to eat at, which turned out to be nearly a mile away.",2014-08-09T05:20:46Z,72
1885,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"this is the worst hotel I have ever been to when it comes to location, service and amenities. the pictures look nothing like the actual rooms. the rooms are extremely cramped with cheap furniture. our room even came with bugs!! when we told the man at the front desk that there were bugs in our room his first response was ""what kind?"" and then we showed him pictures and told him that we wanted to cancel our stay and he told us that we would find bugs at any hotel we went to, normalizing it. besides the bugs, the hotel is located on, what we have since been told, the sketchiest street in Vancouver. when we were walking towards the hotel the sidewalks were lined with homeless people who were doing drugs among other things. when we expressed our concern about the Neighborhood to the man at the front desk he told us ""nothing serious has ever happened."" PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE IT IS NOT WORTH SAVING A COUPLE BUCKS!!!! I would NOT recommend.",2019-11-10T05:43:28Z,72
1886,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"So, yeah, this place is definitely a ""budget"" motel. It is in one of the worst areas of town, but is right around the corner from the up and coming Gaslamp district. You can find ""safer"" streets to walk down to get to the Gaslamp other than Hastings. Hastings is a crack head's paradise! I got offered every drug imaginable as well as sex, all within a one block radius. All in all, I felt safe in the hotel, even if the lock on my door could have been picked with a toothpick. The staff was friendly, the room was basic and, for the most part, clean. Considering how much we saved on lodging, I may even stay there again. At least I got some awesome photos of hookers on the corner below as a souvenir!",2010-06-23T01:41:43Z,72
1887,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"Definitely a budget accommodation but I was pleasantly surprised at how clean the room was! Cramped, yes, but I was expecting that. The room was clean and I certainly appreciated the price compared to other hotels near downtown. I just wanted a clean room with a bed and that is what I got. The front desk people were always very helpful and Pat's Pub next door was great.

The downsides... well, I found the bed very uncomfortable. I guess I shouldn't have been expecting much, but that mattress was not comfortable at all. The other downside is the area... like people have mentioned, lots of homeless, prostitutes, drug activity, etc. I saw one person smoking heroin right on the sidewalk. However, they are pretty harmless and we had zero issues. Also made for entertaining viewing from the safety of the third floor.",2014-05-09T17:53:53Z,72

I was put on hold for more than 20 mins on the phone so I hung up. They were no emailed invoice of my booking, no confirmation by the phone. Yet they still charged me for the room I never even showed up for. Wouldn't it be better if they called whoever's checking in to see if they were coming? I will never book with this hotel & will never ever stay here. I would like to be reimbursed for the horrible customer service via phone.",2014-06-29T20:14:05Z,72
1889,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"We stayed here in May 2005, and it must be the worst hotel stay I have ever had. Not because of the service, necessarily, the concierge was fine... but, good heavens, we almost ROASTED in this place. It's probably our fault, for planning a last minute visit and just booking a random room (turned out to just be Budget Room - again, our fault), thinking that we were going to be wandering around for most of the day and just need a room to spend the night in. Walking up to our room, with the rickety floors, though, we walked by a couple of open doors. One of those turned out to be right next door to us, with an electric fan banged up against the door and loud people inside. Honestly, I was a little freaked out. Within the room, we saw that the space between our double bed and the drawers was just about two inches - no idea how we were supposed to use those. There was a TV and a round fan. There was a small window, which we had to keep open the entire night. The bathroom was small enough that I could NOT change in there. The shower stall was also just barely big enough for standing room. Now I understand that we'd have a small bathroom - but I never imagined it would be THIS small.

So, probably through our own fault, we didn't have a good experience within our own room. Out on the hallway, I was a little freaked. The first floor - all ok. 

We came out of this experience with important lessons - no matter how little time we THINK we're going to stay in a hotel, we have to make sure that the hotel comes with air conditioning... because apparently we are mistaken in thinking this is the current default in this day and age.

Looking at their website, they may have expanded their rooms this year. But I'm not curious enough to try staying there again.",2008-08-07T03:45:38Z,72
1890,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"This was the worst hotel I have ever been in. The room was tiny at best, which would have been ok if it had been clean, but it was far from clean. The carpet looked very dirty and there was unknown debris in every corner. The sink was in front of the bed, and the toilet and shower were inside of bifold closet doors. Wouldn't have used either. No A/C and when we opened the room to air it out...no window screens. No heat other than a tiny radiator...I am guessing steam. It must have been there when the hotel opened in 1910.  Elevator doesn't operate correctly and stops at least 1"" lower or higher than the hallway. A definite fall hazard. The front desk charged us for one nights lodging and about $100 extra for ""incidentals."" What incidentals, I have no idea. They said it would be returned to our account in a few days! Sketchy location at best. Two cab drivers told us it is a know drug dealing area and there were homeless and or drug users panhandling/sleeping on the sidewalks. We did not stay...we made tracks to a different hotel and they would not refund our money. Sketchy location, patrons and business practices.",2018-09-02T21:24:45Z,72
1891,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"A lot of drug addicts were loitering right outside the hotel; one dealer asked me if I wanted some weed for $5. The sidewalk itself actually smelled of marijuana. 
I couldn't go out in the night, because it was too scary.

When I first entered my room, it had an unpleasant smell, which gave me a headache. After walking on the floor barefoot, my feet started smelling bad too. Moreover, the bathroom door was not actually a door - it was just a folding piece of wood. Upon opening the window, there were needle-like spikes on the windowsill. Yikes - what a safety hazard. I'm seriously curious about what happened in that room before I booked it for a few nights. 

The hotel was really cheap though, but I think there was a reason for that. Actually, I'm not even sure if the Patricia Hotel can be called a hotel. 

On the upside, the staff was very accommodating and tried to assist me in my travels around the city.",2013-04-12T04:23:34Z,72

1893,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"This hotel is the WORST hotel I've ever had the misfortune of staying at. It's worse than the $40 motels in Niagara Falls, yet over twice the price. Rooms do not have fridges, use old radiators, don't have AC, have twenty year old TVs, and the bath is some ginormous monstrosity that has an interior smaller than a normal bath. Room doors are flimsy wood and use a standard key. The staff member who checked me in was rude and dismissive, however the staff member who checked me out was kind and respectful. The neighbourhood also leaves a lot to be desired. The equivalent price to the Days Inn on Kingsway makes no sense given the ""quality"" of the establishment, and I would have gone there instead had there been any vacancies. I would absolutely not recommend this hotel to anyone and would strongly recommend others go elsewhere if at all possible.",2016-06-01T00:47:04Z,72
1894,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"We were looking for a cheap place to stay before and after a cruise. The Patricia has a helpful staff, clean rooms, hearty breakfast, and the bus goes right to it. (From the airport, take the train to the waterfront and go to the visitor's center by the food court for public bus info to the hotel... if you do it all in 90 minutes, it's $2.75 Canadian). And the bus from the hotel took us to 4 blocks away from the port. Compare that to a $50 cab ride from the airport.  

As noted, the area is not so pretty. However, we are no stranger to inner cities. Many of our hotel-mates were also getting on a cruise, were 'older' and usually European with children. We did venture out in the evening to walk 9 minutes to Gastown for dinner. The worst thing that happened was that 2 men of questionable backgrounds commented on my 'titties'. Whatever. The people are harmless. Just don't have your camera around your neck. They're either on drugs or should be. But not threatening at all. 

Quick walk to Chinatown. 

We had a good giggle about the bathroom door, the window structure (got kids? walk in before them and secure the window), and the view.  But we would go back. We will suggest it to certain friends but not others. We would let our teenage daughters go alone.  If you are well traveled, can handle New York subways, love finding bargains at thrift stores, can laugh at new experiences and have worked with certain populations (I'm a nurse...), then you can save your cash for a dog sled ride by staying here and using the bus. If you're a wimp and prone to panic attacks or have only lived in neighborhoods with cul-de-sacs, stay near the waterfront and use a cab.

1895,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"I would not stay at the Ritz Carlton if it was in this neighborhood. The staff was the only thing redeeming in the whole building. The free wi-fi did not work in our room. I don't mind small rooms, but let me tell you it was tiny. The door could be jimmied opened with a pocketknife and the window to the fire escape was wide open. Probably because there is no AC. Everything aside, this is the worst neighborhood I have been in. Anybody who says otherwise is so calloused to human suffering that they feel nothing about seeing hookers,crackheads,dealers, etc.  for about a four block radius of this place. Oh and by the way, your car is in a ""parking lot""/hooker meth bump room, open to everyone. Which the hotel informs you that you should have nothing in your vehicle because it will get stolen. This was on a piece of paper in the elevator. My wife and I left after about 20 mins there. Wtf indeed!",2012-07-22T04:23:39Z,72
1896,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"OMFG! I feel like I know what it is like to be a crack whore now. This place is so disgusting. I stayed for less than 12 hours total. It was about $90 and made a jail cell look like the Ritz. It's true, I saw a hooker passed out with her head between her legs and her legs outstretched. It looked like this crazy dead hooker yoga pose. I saw her the next day though so she wasn't really dead, but a commanding performance!!! The room was a little bit larger than a Jeep Cherokee. Although they are all nonsmoking rooms, there were enough cigarette burns in the blankets to convinvce me no one else knew that. The windows don't close, it's 150 degrees all night, it is truely the red light district, nothing is around it and I don't know a single person that would dare to walk barefoot on the floor or squeeze into the airplane sized bathroom. They should have paid me to stay there or I at least deserve a reality series based off the experience. Wowie, I never felt more happy to be American in my life!!!

1897,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"This is actually my first Yelp review and I felt compelled to finally write one specifically for the Patricia Hotel due to how many poor reviews I have read for it despite it being a really great place.

First of all, the staff here is excellent.  Especially the gentleman of middle eastern descent that works at the front desk.  I feel really bad that I can't remember his name but it takes me way more times than hearing it once to remember somebody's name.  He was exceptionally helpful and always greeted me (with my name of course...which makes me feel even worse for not remembering his!) every time he saw me, even in other parts of the hotel, when I'm sure he was on his break.  I also happened to casually ask about coupons for attractions around the city and he mentioned that they didn't have any coupon books.  But the next time that I ran into him he had printed up a whole page of coupons for me and had them waiting for me at the front desk.

The room I stayed in was a no frills deal but that was exactly what I was expecting for $40 a night at a place that has ""Budget Inn"" in its name.  It was all I needed though.  It was clean, comfortable, and quiet.  I had wifi, cable tv, and a pub on the bottom floor.  What more can you ask for when you just want a place that's comfortable to crash in while you visit the city?

Now let's address the issue that I think is the main reason for the low reviews of this place...the location.  Sure it's not the nicest part of town but it's nowhere near as bad as some people on here make it out to be.  There are a couple of blocks that are a bit crowded with street people but no one ever really bothered me.  These people aren't dangerous they are just people in unfortunate situations.  And anyone that's writing such horrible reviews about the people around the town here are just inconsiderate to the plights of the poorer class and are afraid they will somehow be infected by being near those less fortunate than them.  I learned for ease of passage to just take the next block up or down from Hastings if I felt like having a quieter and more comfortable walk.  It's really only about two blocks where the sidewalks get kind of concentrated with the ""unsavory element"" which is apparently such a blemish upon the Patricia Hotel to some reviewers somehow.

I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone that wants an affordable but quality place to stay.  It actually felt kind of homey in my three nights there.  I definitely look forward to going back and staying here again.",2013-11-23T10:26:40Z,72
1898,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"Prefacing by saying I am an experienced traveler having stayed at a plethora of hotels and hostels around the world, so I am used to less than ideal conditions and/or neighborhoods. I arrived around midnight on a Thursday. The walk from the main train station to the hotel was only about 15 minutes. Once I turned right onto East Hastings off Main Street, I was greeted by addicts and prostitutes; they lined the entire four block walk to the hotel. While it may not have been overtly dangerous, it was certainly more than a little unsettling and not something I wanted to pass by daily (or, more importantly, nightly). It's also worth mentioning that this particular neighborhood is the worst in all of Canada and even has its own Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Eastside I ended up staying the first night because it was late and there were no alternatives. This one night stay resulted in 13 bed bug bites lining my shoulders and neck; I was staying on the fifth floor. The positive is that I was only charged for one night and the rest of my money was refunded. The staff was friendly enough and, while the room was small, it wasn't unlivable if you're willing to put up with the neighborhood and bed bugs. As a whole, I would not recommend staying here. Just bite the bullet and fork up the cash for a downtown hotel (what I ended up doing) or look for an AirBnb.",2016-07-18T00:22:04Z,72
1899,Budget Inn Patricia Hotel,2.2,"The worst hotel I have ever stayed in, bar none. I knew the location wasn't great; that's not their fault. But: my room stunk like old urine, the comforter had cigarette burns in it, and the towels were marked. It felt like a health hazard getting into bed - even before I read reviews on here saying the place had bedbugs, I felt extremely itchy. The carpet felt filthy beneath my feet, and the paint-chipped radiator groaned and creaked all night long as if it was about to blow. I couldn't afford to go and stay anywhere else, so I stuck with it. When I checked out, I let the blonde, curly-haired woman on the front desk know about my issues, and she said I should have complained on the first day and they would have given me another room. Perhaps I should have, but as I said to her, the fact that they thought this room was suitable for people to pay to stay in didn't give me much hope when it came to the other rooms. ""That's not fair,"" she said. I told her I'd read the Yelp reviews and that other people had said the same and worse. She said, ""oh, well, Yelp's a bad website."" So here you go, The Patricia, one more bad review on a bad website written by someone who clearly just had the one bad experience that anyone has ever had in your festering 200-something room hotel.

We njoyed having informal dinners there and the beer brewed on the premises. 
We walked everywhere from there, absolutely no problems, even at night (perhaps late might be not so comfortable, a smile often got one back, even from some sad faces. 
We enjoyed the view of the city and mountains from our room and the entertaining neighbouring backyard view, two big white rabbits and a hen living amongst the normal backyard stuff!
Noor advised us about other good places to eat and visit, and had discounts available for many of the Vancouver attractions, he called us a particularly nice and informative taxi driver when we had to leave to catch our train.
There was  a free bookshelf in the lobby, anyone able to leave surplus books and/or take others.
All we needed was a few more days!

There are literally dozens of drug zombies walking around for several blocks around this place, prostitutes everywhere, ones with track marks and without teeth.  Very scary (and I've lived in New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles - I know what a skid row looks like - this one is the worst I have ever seen).  Also - some other strange things - this ""hotel"" asks for a $50 upfront returnable deposit for every night you stay, which they actually charge to your credit card.  They ask this from you when you check in.  If this is not enough for you  - the elevator was broken, the room is tiny and smells of chemical disinfectant, there was no heat, and no blowdryer.

The elevator seemed ready to fail, and was stopping at least 3-6"" below the floor; the halls were creaky and stank of stale oldness and smoke; you could hear people in their rooms on your room and above/below; the area is not a good one (sirens went by within 15min of being in the building) and there are working girls and drug addicts lining the streets; etc. The part that pushed me over the edge was when we opened our rooms' door, and discovered that the bathroom (stand-up shower and toilet) were inside of a closet with a single sliding door.

I recently had the misfortune of spending three nights at Best Western Plus, a stay that unfortunately left much to be desired. The most glaring issue was the cleanliness, or rather, the lack thereof. Upon arriving in my room, I was greeted by long, thin hairs scattered on the bed, a sight that was as unexpected as it was disconcerting. It's a basic expectation that one's room should be thoroughly cleaned before their stay, and sadly, this was not the case here.

1907,Best Western Plus Vancouver Airport Hotel,2.8,"The room itself had incredibly comfortable beds which I was pleasantly surprised by and the complimentary toiletries were lovely. The staff member when we checked in was friendly and helpful. 

The 2 stars down are for a couple of frustrating experiences that I had with the nighttime staff member. We were in town to see a concert and most places to eat when the show was over was either packed to capacity or closed. We went back to the hotel and Doordashed some late night dinner. The restaurant didn't send utensils and it didn't occur to me to specifically ask. My friend went down to the front desk to ask if they might be able to grab us some forks from the attached restaurant or if they had any plastic cutlery. She was told a firm ""no"" and I found it odd that they wouldn't have a staff lunchroom that they wouldn't have a couple of forks from to let us borrow. My friend who was asking works in hospitality and said that that sort of thing is basic stuff to have on stock for out-of-towners who aren't familiar with city rules (like not providing single use cutlery).

That same night, I was unable to sleep because I was in a lot of pain. I went to the front desk to see if there was any Advil or Tylenol for purchase in their little shop. I was told no, which is fine!  It's not the hotel's fault that I didn't plan for pain. What was upsetting was that the person working at the desk couldn't even be bothered to look at me at all when he replied. I realize it's late at night and the hotel was packed and he was probably dealing with silly tourists all night but, it's common courtesy to look at someone when they are talking to you. And, at an airport hotel, 99% of your clientele will be tourists.

The entire waiting lobby was packed. So that means I'd have to wait outside somewhere until 4 PM and then jump in line to register? That's what I was told. 

I went to my car and checked the reviews of this hotel on Trip Advisor and Google Reviews. Yeah, just read them, and it's funny how the management of this hotel tries to say they provide the best service. You can't have that many terrible reviews and claim you are doing your best. These people aren't even trying.

I cancelled my reservation and we checked ourselves into another hotel for about 40 dollars more than what was being asked, and had a splendid time there.

1913,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"We flew into Vancouver and stayed here for one night before we boarded a cruise ship.  We chose this hotel because it is actually located IN the airport, so it was convenient for us to meet the representative from the cruise line the next day for transport to the ship.  I want to specifically commend two employees.

KUNAL at the front desk was exceedingly polite and helpful in terms of: (a) sending our luggage to our room; (b) walking us to the restaurant; (c) explaining the room charges in detail; and (d) making notes on our account to ensure our son and daughter-in-law were not asked for their credit card upon their much later arrival (I paid for their room, as well as our own room, when we checked in).

The next morning, our party of five, which included my other son (in a wheelchair), plus another couple with whom we were not acquainted, got stuck in one of the elevators.  It just stopped on the seventh floor while we were on our way down to breakfast.  We used the emergency telephone to call for help.  None of us panicked - indeed, I'd been stuck in an elevator several decades ago and just sat on the floor and read a book until help arrived 30 minutes later (although the husband of the other couple was getting a little jittery).  VICTORIA CALLEJAS RAYMOND told us help was on the way, but she arrived before the maintenance crew and managed to open the door herself.  We were only stuck for five minutes! 

The only downside was the restaurant.  The service was fine, of course, but $42 (Canadian) for a burger and fries was ridiculous.  I realize the prices were jacked up because (a) you're at an airport, so you're a captive audience; (b) you're at a high-end hotel; and (c) you're paying for convenience.  Still, the food was only mediocre.  See photos of menu and food.",2023-10-27T18:04:22Z,153

Had to laugh out loud when the check came and the first tip % option was 18%.  Over ride to zero and we're out of here, never to return.",2024-02-24T18:34:32Z,153

1917,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"I cannot find many faults with this convenient on airport hotel. Clean, quiet and mere steps from the terminal back to the US. 

Found the bar and restaurant to have both good dining and drinks. Service is very good.

Unfortunately the hotel was completely booked (except for the $1200/n suite, which is a little out of my budget) BUT the reason I wanted to leave a review was for the concierge MARCO. He helped lighten my sad spirit as well as offered me water to drink while I figured out what do next. His warmth helped me made the best of a bad situation and I'm thankful for kindness and support.

Just finished dinner in The Globe restaurant, (The Fairmont's main restaurant), and had spectacular oysters from New Foundland.  All happy until leaving and walking past a table of men who also had oysters.  Theirs were 3x the size of what I was served! Under appetizers the oyster option was 6 or 12. Then there was the seafood tower that had oysters.  Granted, the men had the seafood tower, but 3x the difference???  Hmmmm.  Our fish, (halibut and salmon), was over cooked too.",2023-07-29T03:38:36Z,153

1923,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"Stopped by for a lunch before my flight.
Very beautiful spot, of course, as usual as Fairmount is an amazing chain.
That's what my 2 stars are for.
The service was one of the worst. The lady at the bar that was serving us was the opposite of pleasant and nice. Any question we asked about food she would give us an answer that made us feel like complete idiots. 
For example: ""what would YOU choose to eat: fish and chips or salmon burger? Which one of these dishes you think is better, for your liking (because I DO CARE WHAT THE STAFF LIKES, they work at the restaurant, they must try their own food).
She answered: ""Well, one of them you eat with a fork, the other one you eat with your hands.""
Daaaaaa
So sorry, I'm a retard, I don't know that! 
Anyway, ended up ordering a salmon bowl for $25.
Just lots of rice and a dry salmon. 
((((((
So disappointed. For such price I should get at least some vegetables. 
I guess next time I'll stuff myself with whatever else is at the airport food court or just eat some cold food on the plain. Don't want to feel like a retard at the fairmont restaurant, because that's how that lady made me feel.",2017-04-11T04:28:54Z,153
1924,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"Probably my favourite hotel in the whole world. I usually stay here before/ after a long haul flight, and it's the perfect way to relax and get well rested. It's luxurious, literally inside Vancouver airport, and has all of the perks you would expect from a world class hotel.

I honestly can't find any faults in the service. The front desk is very welcoming, the restaurant staff are delightful, and the gym staff are helpful. The day spa within the hotel is absolutely fantastic and worth every penny, especially when you're about to spend 16 hours crammed into a flying tin can.

The gym facility is great with most of the machines you would expect, and is an awesome way to burn off nervous energy before you travel. The changing rooms are spacious enough, with secure lockers, tons of towels, a swim suit dryer, toiletries and a sauna. The lap pool is small but has some sort of current thing to swim against, and the whole pool area is surrounded by lounge chairs should you choose to relax while your kids/ partner/ friends take a swim. 

I'm fairly certain that every room comes with a bath tub, which are huge and probably better than the actual hot tub down by the pool. The rooms also usually have a kick ass view of the runway, as well as a bonus set of binoculars (in the drawer by the bed) to spy on incoming planes.

Something that really sets Fairmont hotels apart from others of a similar rank is the toiletries. They use Le Labo's Rose 31 soaps and shampoos, and I'm honestly addicted to the scent. It's musky but still a bit floral, really quite subtle with a hint of spice. It's great to find something new and refreshing in such an established hotel. 

The downsides? The rooms are pricey, and the breakfast buffet (although undeniably lovely) is also really expensive. But you know what? It's absolutely worth it, and I will continue to stay at the Fairmont every time I visit Vancouver.",2015-03-14T13:27:23Z,153

The rooms are of the highest quality to help you relax after a long day of travel. Each room includes a large soaking tub and separate shower with Le Labo amenities. The beds are so comfortable you'll dread going home to your measly SERTA.

We arrived at 10pm from Newark and stayed overnight here. We were heading to Whistler the next day and wanted to get a good night's sleep before hopping on the 2+ hr shuttle. The lobby is just upstairs from the departures terminal, and could not be more convenient. Our room was beautiful, and the Le Labo soaps were much appreciated. The staff are super friendly and just lovely. The best part of the room is the view of the airplanes/tarmac. The kids went crazy over this. It was shockingly very quiet.

On a clear day, the mountains are visible and you can see the planes taking off and landing. The food was delicious. You get your choice of tea, and the food is a set menu. We got two different kinds of scones, one regular and the other apricot rosemary with Devonshire cream and homemade rhubarb and strawberry jam. There were four different kinds of sandwiches, with a mixture of flavors from various cuisines. The tea was finished with four small desserts. When we made the reservation, they asked if we had any dietary needs, so if you are vegan or vegetarian I recommend telling them before hand because almost everything contained meat or dairy.",2018-05-15T02:02:47Z,153

Rooms were nicely sized (409 sq. Ft.) with easy-to-control light switches (labeled in English). Separate tub, shower and toilet areas.

Wish I had time to hit the gym... 

In the dining room, the beef tenderloin, salad and ahi were fresh and delicious. The local whole lobster was not as impressive (but then again I was spoiled with amazing whole lobster in Victoria at the Keg).  The cheesecake was nice and fluffy.

1938,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"..""Memories""

'Fairmont Vancouver Airport'  was our lodging spot prior to several trips my lady and I made south to Mexico over recent years.  For us, we loved the convenience -- it was definitely you sure can't get any closer to your flight than this place!  And going out there to stay the night before an early morning flight the next day reduced anxiety on the day of travel -- we were there, no taxi to the airport needed, or weather concerns, and such.

For us, daughter usually drove us out to the airport and hotel early the day before our flight, giving us almost the full day to relax and enjoy - we always considered and called it 'day one' of our trip.  We had the time to do as we wished -- which included several walkabouts of the airport, browsing shops & such, watching others come & go, and spending most of the time to just sit, relax, and watch flights come and go from our room at the hotel.  We never dined at the hotel, just caught a fast food dinner at one of the locations in the terminal nearest the hotel, and did the same for breakfast the next morning.

Staff at the hotel were always friendly, and very accommodating.  Not once did we ever encounter a problem with any aspect of a room reservation we had made, or related matter.  We always asked for rooms facing north - i.e., looking towards the north shore mountain - the views were especially pretty during the months when the mountains were bearing snow.  

Staying at the 'Fairmont Airport' always provided a nice add-on adventure to our trips south.  We enjoyed the stays there very much.",2020-12-03T21:55:17Z,153
1939,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"As far as airport hotels go. This is probably the nicest one i have ever stayed at. I mean, they lay out alone is definitely super nice. 

You walk into the room and as you turn right on the sliding doors, you can see the massive bathroom. Separate toilet, separate shower and the bathtub. You can literally soak and look out the window feature and watch your netflix show. 

The beds are super nice and plush. There's controls for the lighting right at the bedside wall. Which makes it real nice to turn on the bathroom lights right at the bedside.

The lobby is pretty ok. The real conversation piece are the rooms. I totally enjoyed staying here. I enjoyed a good soak and that rainfall shower head is super dope.

Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!",2019-06-14T19:54:39Z,153
1940,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"I've stayed in this hotel for only one reason...convenience being situated right on the airport and their Rose scented toiletries. The bed is comfortable just as much as the Hilton and Marriott. They have a fully equip gym and a restaurant. The hotel is also right on the departure/ticketing area that is also surrounded with food vendors and Starbucks. 

Despite of the outstanding room that they offer, I am giving it a 3 out of 5 star because of the rudeness of their employees. They had been that way since the day I've been coming here. They would not greet you when you check in and won't even do as simple as eye contact. Like they're better than you. I find this very rude and disrespectful. Every time you would ask a question, they would answer very short and unfriendly. The funny part was I thought I was the only one that actually noticed the attitude, but my co-worker that checked in with me said it first, ""was it just me or that guy was very rude and short""? She was right, I've noticed that since Day 1. I have-not made a review on this hotel, but today, I made a point to sit and take my MacAir and write this review because it needs to change. This is not great customer service. 

If I just didn't have any early flight, I wouldn't stay here. I might just find another hotel close by because I don't think I'll be staying here again.I'd rather stay in a smaller hotel that has great customer service than stay in a 5 star hotel that belittles you.

Not recommending this hotel.",2019-04-10T21:48:55Z,153
1941,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"Wow! What a fantastic hotel. I'm likely to stay here on my next trip to Vancouver. 

I fly to Vancouver a couple times a year and normally take the 6 am flight back home. This means a 3 am wake up call but not when you stay at the Fairmont. An extra hour sleep is fantastic. 

Even so, I give this hotel five stars because...
- Excellent service 
- Posh rooms with huge bathes
- A really good restaurant and lounge
- Nice amenities 
- Quiet, I did not hear the planes
- Beds I can sleep in

The front desk was really helpful in making dinner arrangements for us in the city too.",2019-03-01T14:20:46Z,153

Pros: service was great, very attentive and friendly. Great view of the planes coming and going with the mountains in the background. Good choice of teas.
Cons: genuinely horrible food. This is not a traditional afternoon tea, and I get that, but what they served today was terrible. They served a mashed potato sandwich. I really thought I had misheard, but no, potato between a slimy tortilla like bread of beets and yam. Beet infused devilled eggs . The smallest scones ever and the weird maple syrup one was not very nice. Small desserts were just ok, but the pumpkin mousse tasted like baby food. Generous portions of clotted cream and jam, but neither are of the highest quality.",2021-11-01T06:53:12Z,153

1945,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"Came here with a couple of good friends with the purchase of a Groupon for High Tea. We definitely enjoyed the ambiances and the service here. So the high tea came with some good pastries and their famous Fairmont tea. For the price we paid was ok. Not like a wow wow deal. If this was regular price then its too much. We noticed most of the people having high tea here all have Groupon. 

From the high tea I do like their earl grey devil egg. Interesting flavor. The scones were not bad but not like something special. The curry flavored tuna bun was really awesome. The desserts were ok. Not like something that would make me wow. Very standard, I should put it. 

The restaurant was not very full. Well this is actually a one time experience here. So will not go on Groupon and buy another one.",2018-05-05T07:36:19Z,153

The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The beds are soft and the noise level is very minimal. We stayed overnight and checked out early for our flight to Calgary. 
The amenities are great--and they gave enough for more than the four of us needed. There is a wide selection of snacks and alcohol in their mini bar. 
If you need to stay somewhere overnight for your connecting flight, I recommend that you stay here. Enjoy!",2018-03-03T12:20:45Z,153
1947,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"We had missed our flight back to the SF Bay Area, and I didn't feel like getting a hotel that was located outside of the airport.  The Fairmont Hotel seemed like a great solution since we had a 6:00am flight departing Vancouver the next morning.  All we would need to do the day of our flight was just take the elevator and escalator down to the departure area and walk to the E Gates, and it would be as simple as that.  We would not have to worry about getting up extra early for our flight and worrying about transportation back to the airport for our flight.  That is why I was willing to pay a little bit more money for the convenience of staying at a real airport hotel.

I can honestly say that this hotel was disappointment to my fiancé and I.  Aside from being conveniently located at the Vancouver Airport, we just didn't find our hotel room to be that spectacular.  The bathroom was nice, but the room was a bit dated.  I also have a lot of electronic gadgets, and we found that our hotel room did not have enough electrical and/or usb outlets.  I might stay here again because of the convenience of the location inside the airport, but I would definitely consider other options unless they upgrade their rooms.",2019-08-13T04:09:06Z,153
1948,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"Imagine walking three minutes to check in for your flight after getting out of bed.

Four or five stars.... really doesn't matter, if you're flying out of Vancouver International... there is no other airport hotel better than the Fairmont.

Located inside the terminal, the Fairmont offers luxury and accessibility.

There are some downsides.... front desk staff were stone faced and didn't crack a smile (they may need to take a Marriott employee course)... the rooms could use a refresh, but the common areas are beautiful.

Bathrooms and tubs are big and really the focal point of the rooms.

The high points are the restaurant and bar, which offer expanding views of the airport and tarmac. 

While I visited, the restaurant and bar were packed... they had live music... a big roaring fireplace and the bartender couldn't have been nicer (Perhaps he should school the front desk staff?).

Food was amazing.... 

If you want to skip the hassle of an airport shuttle or rushing to the airport in the morning, the Fairmont might be a good choice.",2019-01-24T05:19:37Z,153
1949,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"This is a really nice hotel, and super convenient for meetings at the Vancouver airport. It's located in the International Departures section of the airport, so a bit of a walk from Domestic Arrivals. Still, it's so much easier than taking a train downtown.

The hotel is luxurious but modern, unlike most Fairmonts in Canada. It's clearly a new hotel. Check-in was friendly and helpful. The rooms are great, and most seem to overlook the airplane taxiway and gates, which is cool. Despite this, they somehow managed to make very quiet rooms (great soundproofing).

I also really enjoyed my time in the bar and restaurant. The food and drinks were great, although expensive.  The fitness centre was also good, with plenty of equipment (cardio and weights), a pool and a sauna.

I would come back!!",2018-12-18T13:15:43Z,153
1950,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"I would absolutely be a morning person if it started at noon.  However, if we're forced to get up at the crack of dawn for a flight we're like the walking dead. That's where this Fairmont comes in, you're literally in the airport.  An elevator is all that separates you from airline check-in.

We've had several stays here over the past few months, and even though we are Marriott loyalists, being able to sleep more before a flight trumps the rewards points. So here's the breakdown:

The room: Ask for a room on the side where the planes take off and land.  I'm a sensitive sleeper and I've never heard anything through the glass, the room is sound proof against the noise from plane engines.  The bathrooms are also really cool, the wall that separates the bathroom from the bedroom has sliding door window, so you can soak in an Epsom salt bath (provided in each room), sip on wine and watch planes land and take off from your bathtub.  It's so relaxing and they even give you a plane watching guide that gives you the specs of each plane that comes through the airport. The rooms are also very spacious and the beds are comfy.

In room dining: This is like a car engine that needed to be warmed up. The first dinner we had although while tasty was cold an took forever (over an hour) to get to us. We did complain and after that our experiences with that outlet have just gotten better and better, even with breakfast arriving in 15 minutes the last two times we ordered. Nothing tastes bad on the menu, our favorites are the Rib Eye, Salmon, Crab Cakes, and Vegetarian Eggs Benedict.

Fur Babies: They are very pet friendly here.  Our fur babies got treats at check-in from the bellmen and everyone that works here loves dogs. Additionally, there is an small walking trail, that has a lot of grass for the your pets to do their business next to the hotel, which you wouldn't think would be there because you are at the airport.  The only drawback for us is that we can't leave our well-behaved, house trained fur babies alone in the room. Which is why we prefer Marriott branded hotels because we can. So we're pretty much confined to the room with our doggies, I hope they relax this rule in the future.

Fitness Center and Pool: You can people watch while you work out or hangout at the pool.  The facility over looks Delta Airlines check-in so its interesting to see of what people are doing down there while you get your workout in. There are a lot of cardio machines and weights so there is never a wait to use anything. 

Valet/Parking: Who knows of where self parking is here, I would only valet.  Getting our car is the only thing that continues to take a long time, and I'm not even sure if this team belongs to the Fairmont. I think they are a outsourced company, but you can wait a while before someone pops up to help you.

Service: The employees that work here are super friendly.  From the housekeeper down the hall to wait staff walking through the lobby area and room service team, everyone here has been so nice and genuinely focused on us having a good stay.

If you are stuck at YVR do not hesitate to book here.  Heck, if I had a crazy long layover or a very delayed flight here, I would ask for a day rental. It beats waiting at an airport gate in uncomfortable chairs!

1951,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"I love this hotel chain. I trust that whenever I stay at any Fairmont hotel or eat at any of their restaurants it's going to be good. 

I was so sad about my experience here. The hostess was amazing so friendly. After that.. not much else. We had a groupon (ordered more on the side). The set was mediocre. Not bad but not good and I cannot imagine anyone paying regular price for it so I'm SUPER glad we got the groupon. 

The best thing was the charcuterie board but that's not apart of the groupon ): 


Over all atmosphere is classy, modern, and a decent place to sit and relax. Our waitress took forever though it seemed like she would do something then run away. I didn't see any other servers though but there were only 2 other tables other than us.",2019-07-12T04:54:40Z,153
1952,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"Located far away from the crowd, close to the international terminal, Fairmont is a refuge for those wanting to stay low and calm in between flights. The hotel offers different services for long layovers including massage, access to the gym (and you could even rent gym outfit), restaurants and 4-hour room stay. Mind you, these services are not cheap, a 4-hour room stay can cost you around $150- $180. But if you have the money, I'd go for it.

Their brunch buffet is decent with just enough selection of quality food - both healthy and arteries-killing. Try the grilled avocado, it's delicious. But seriously, only Satan​ doesn't like avocados​. Their selection of cheeses is few, but the quality is good.",2018-11-24T20:43:52Z,153

The room for one is more comfortable and luxurious and even though it's at the airport it is so quiet you don't hear the planes even though you can see them.  
The hotel is well kept and doesn't seem to show any signs of its age.

1954,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"Not sure how this Hotel is considered a 4star luxury hotel. I had one of the last flights in at night and one of the 1st out in the morning, so it made sense to get rest at a luxury hotel that was so close to the airport (literally inside of it).  Unfortunately the room was noisy, I could here a everything Inthe surrounding rooms. The bedding was uncomfortable as well. Both these factors left me with little to no sleep. When I checked in I inquired how long it would take me to walk to my gate. The desk agent informed where the check-in desk for my airline, and assured me 10 minutes would be more then enough time. In the morning I walked to where the airline check in was supposed to be I was told it had not been in that area for a year or so and that I needed to go to another terminal that a bus would take me to. Well the buss only runs every 30 minutes, if I waited for the next buss I would have most likely missed my flight or not been able to check my bags.  I was able to finally flag down a cab to take me (at a cost of $30) I barely made it to have my checked bags get on the plane and also had no time to eat breakfast before my flight. 

Overall I am greatly disappointed in a hotel that is supposed to be luxury and costs a premium price to have these types of issues derail what would otherwise have been a great trip. 

I would not recommend this hotel. I should have chosen one of the hotels on the River just minutes from my terminal.",2022-02-06T16:35:04Z,153
1955,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"What a beautiful hotel. The room was big, clean, modern looking, and quiet -- considering we're right beside a noisy airport! Bathroom was very nice too.

We were only here for one night on a layover from TO to Honolulu. Wish we could have stayed longer. A staff member greeted us in the airport near the escalators leading up to the hotel. He asked us our names and told us he would let the staff upstairs know we were on our way. By the time we got to the top of the escalator there was someone waiting for us with our room key. Check-out was equally as painless.

Toiletries smell amazing. 

Top notch hotel!",2016-02-02T04:48:54Z,153
1956,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"First, let me say that I absolutely love going for high tea. For me to be happy it needs to meet 2 criteria....
1. The food and presentation have to be top notch
2. The ambiance needs to reflect a traditional high tea experience. 
The Fairmont Vancouver Airport misses on both counts. 
The food was unimpressive 
The presentation was under whelming
The view is nothing to write home about
To top it off, the bill for high tea was over $140.00
I don't mind spending good money for a great experience, but be forewarned, you won't find it here.",2018-03-04T23:48:30Z,153
1957,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"We came here to celebrate Valentine's Day early with high tea. We were lucky and got a window seat. The window seat was facing the run way and was not a bad view. 

The service was amazing. We were seated as soon as we walked in and our server kept checking up on us throughout the 2 hours we were there. She refilled our teas and offered us to try different types of jams for our biscuits. 

The earl gray and the berry tea we had was really nice and aromatic. My favorite was the top level of biscuits it was still warm and flaky. It paired really well with the blueberry compote. I also really enjoyed the chocolate cake and the pumpkin brûlée tart because it was so rich and creamy. I didn't care for the sandwiches except for the smoked salmon mousse.

Overall great experience! High tea is pretty pricey but it a great treat once in a while.",2018-02-14T18:46:50Z,153
1958,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"It's a Fairmont so of course this is going to be a good review!
I was trying to make my way back to Seattle from Germany and had flown back to Vancouver thinking I could catch the Amtrak, which was sold out and the flight I got had a 12 hr layover so I decided it just book a room (if I hadn't have had work the next day I would have just slept in the airport on a bench). 
This place was super convenient, especially with my flight at 6 am. I figured I could sleep a little longer. It's literally upstairs from the airport. The guy at the front desk was nice, the room was beautiful. I guess I'm used to some mediocre hotels cause I thought this place was pretty nice and spacious. Even when I did pay for a room at a different hotel that was twice as much as here, it still wasn't as nice.

The bathroom was spacious with a good sized tub. The view from the room overlooked the airport and the mountains in the distance. It was gorgeous.

Everything was great except the room service is extremely expensive. I guess there isn't much food around so they can do that but the 18% gratuity on top of the prices is a bit much. I paid about $50 for a burger and a drink. It's convenient but I should have just walked over to the airport's food court.

Otherwise, awesome hotel and I definitely recommend.",2018-01-06T00:45:01Z,153
1959,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"I adore this hotel and value the staff immensely.

Even though I am a resident, I enjoy staying here the day I fly-in (home).  It allows me to unwind and get back into life at a more leisurely pace.  I don't know if I am in the minority here but I LOVE airports.  Watching people greet their loved ones excitedly is better than TV.

The beautiful rooms have expansive runways views.  I find the Gold Level worth the expense.  The floor has it's own concierge and offers a hospitality room with honor bar, appetizers and morning breakfast (I chose to just fill a plate and have breakfast in bed).

The suites have little extras like a scope to watch the runway activity in close detail.

The most important feature for me is that the hotel is pet-friendly. Recently, my stay was a last minute decision and the staff promptly provided a litter box and treats for my cat.  

Room service is high calibre.  The airport has restaurants, liquor store, dentist and much more for any needs that arise.",2015-10-22T02:26:33Z,153

We had to ask our server to bring us our tea, food and bills; because she would not come to our table on her own. It is frustrating to go somewhere and not receive adequate customer service. Based on this experience I would not recommend hight tea at the Fairmont Vancouver airport.

I do have to say that the phone conversation with staff was great and that they were very accommodating to allergies.",2019-06-12T19:29:26Z,153

I had too much time to kill before a flight and decided to use the gym in the hotel for $20. The staff was super friendly and helpful, and the facility was pristine!!

There was enough cardio equipment (ellipticals, treadmills, bikes) that no one had to wait for someone else to finish. There are free weights as well as weight machines. There is a section of just balance equipment (bosu ball, etc.). There is even a sauna!!

The locker room had lockers (obviously), showers, towels, shampoo/soap/conditioner, basically anything you'd need. 

Finally, there were apples and cold water available to us as well.

They took my keys and I had to walk half a block to the door wearing heels (what's the point of valet service?) it was almost 50$ before tip and when I paid, and when I got my keys I had to walk again almost half a block to get my car.",2020-01-13T16:15:14Z,153
1964,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"Most convenient hotel I have EVER stayed in.  The fact that this hotel is located IN the airport directly above the international terminal is unreal to me.

It was also really cool because our room faced the tarmac so if there were planes taking off, we were able to watch them which I found fascinating.",2019-03-13T17:17:18Z,153

1967,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"Quite possibly one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a hotel.   Obviously I'm in an airport so you expect plane noise but it wasn't that, The hotel itself is built so poorly you can hear the elevators go up and down in almost any room.  The walls and floors are paper thin so you get to hear everything upstairs downstairs and to the right and left of you.

1969,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"The staff were super friendly (as expected from Fairmont employees) and the interior of Globe is very elegant. The view was nothing special since it is in the airport. I used a groupon to eat here which was $54 for two people rather than the original price of $54 per person. The savings were really good especially since it included all day parking and seating for 2 hours. The set up was really cute. Very elegant 3 tiered plating with sweets at the top, scones in the middle and savouries at the bottom. There was honestly nothing special about the food or tea here though.

1970,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"Fairmont has a lease contract with Sharp printers, but Canon sounds like it's better suited to them. The cost of staples is insignificant, but still worth hashing out at volume. The machines are capable of a fantastic amount of pages per month at great cost per page, but it's the reduced cost of training that should close the deal. 

I know this because a business meeting was happening right next to our afternoon high tea table between executives who were far more passionate about printers than I'll ever be. Normally I wouldn't mind if customers were loud or unruly, as they are as entitled as we are, but as this appeared to be a Fairmont hotel rep compromising customer experience by hosting a loud meeting during the tea service, I felt put out.

1971,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"My friend and I had a 6 am flight out of YVR.    Fairmont Vancouver Airport was one of the hotels that I was able to get free using my American Airlines points and it is right at the airport.    There is a hallway leading from the terminal to the hotel.     Convenience !!!!
I love the hotel.    Nice lobby, free wifi,  spacious rooms,  extremely comfortable beds.    There is a ""window opening"" from the bathroom into the bedroom,  great for couples,  not so great for anyone else.    The opening can be closed though.    There is a coffee maker in the room as well as snacks (not free).     Our room overlooked the outside terminal where passengers boarded and deboarded planes.    That was neat.  Free coffee in the lobby in the morning.
I looked up the price of the room and for $400+ a night, it is definitely worth it,  even better that it was free.     
From the airport, one can hop on the subway and take that downtown.

Yes I would definitely stay here when in Vancouver.",2016-08-08T00:48:48Z,153

1973,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"* This review is for the Fairmont Afternoon Tea at Fairmont YVR Airport *

The Fairmont YVR Airport is a lovely venue to visit for delicious afternoon tea, food, or drinks. The floor-to-ceiling windows let in lots of natural sunlight, and provide a view of the airplanes flying in and out. The interior surroundings are airy, large and open. The best tables to sit at are by the window so you can watch the planes. The ambiance is relaxing and quiet, which makes for an attractive stop for tired travelers.

The chefs have greatly improved their offerings at the Globe restaurant /Jetside Lounge in the airport since the grand opening of their high tea service from years ago. For those visiting for the first time, the Fairmont YVR Hotel is located inside the Vancouver airport in Richmond BC. The airport is reachable by skytrain or car. For visitor coming by car, 3 complimentary hours of parking are redeemed by bringing in a green token to the restaurant staff. This green token is dispensed from a machine at the entrance to the parking lot. The restaurant staff will issue back a receipt. Save that receipt because it will be need to be shown to the parking lot attendant to redeem the free parking.

Sometimes there are 50% off specials on Groupon for the Fairmont Vancouver Airport afternoon tea sessions. The loose leaf tea arrived in large glass pots. Pictured below are the Creamy Earl Grey and the Kyoto Cherry Rose. They came in generous-sized portions, and both steeped teas were aromatic and deep in flavor. 

The blogger's personal opinion is that it would be nicer if there were more savory items (sandwiches) included in the afternoon tea. The variety of colorful savory and sweet items kept the set interesting, visually appealing, and tasty. The hot smoked salmon, matcha marshmallow, and sweet butter scone were the top favorites at the table. The staff added a surprise treat - a Happy Anniversary edible sign with chocolate dipped strawberries in the end for a special occasion. It was a nice touch and a lovely finale to the afternoon tea outing.",2017-11-23T18:34:54Z,153
1974,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"This is the only hotel located directly inside the airport, so it couldn't be more convenient for our overnight layover. 

The last minute plan to stay here was seamless. 

Found a decent rate online, took a screenshot, and thankfully they honored it since I was unable to book it online (due to international dateline issues). 

The hotel was very busy but every interaction was perfect from the bellman in the reception area to the final checkout at 4:30 am. 

At check in we were given passes to the Fairmont's private lounge in the airport and advised to get breakfast there in the morning...complimentary. 

Even the phone attendant helping me with an issue related to needing a cold remedy late at night (their bell staff can drive you to a nearby pharmacy if needed, on an as available basis!) was exceptional. 

Unfortunately you just don't see this ""genuine"" human side of service as often as you'd like. 

I confidently recommend staying at this property!

The fact that you have incredible floor-to-ceiling glass window views of the runway is just a huge bonus! 

If you have kids don't miss the Vancouver airline identification guide brochure in each room...they will surely love spotting the various aircraft as they land.",2016-03-18T21:19:44Z,153

1977,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"This was ok. The service was ok, not as great as other high tea places I've been to. Having high tea here reminds me of having high tea on a cruise, but better service and ambience on a cruise. Their selection of teas was also very limited. The only thing that was good was the food, but that was it. Upon getting our tea and milk, I noticed her facial expression. She saw something in the milk, turned around and smelt it, turned back around and gave us one and said she will be right back. Milk was obviously bad and of course she forgot to bring milk back. Witnessing that freaked me out and made me sniff the milk on our table. I wouldn't say $69/per person is worth it, you might as well buy yourself a groupon and go. Not sure what the hype is all about. Pretty dissapointed.",2018-04-21T16:54:55Z,153
1978,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"This review is for the high tea. Purchased the $75 Groupon for 2 for the high tea + parking. 7 tiny pieces of mini sandwiches and sweets, 2 teas and 2 wines didn't satisfy us very much and more importantly - was not worth the price. We notice it didn't look fresh either especially the turkey pesto mini sandwich. Looks like it's been sitting in the kitchen all day. Ambience is great for sure but value for money? Fail.",2016-03-08T03:48:03Z,153
1979,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"Definitely a unique place to have high tea - in the middle of a busy airport. 

Fairmount Hotel at YVR offers high tea service starting at 2pm with 30 mins intervals for $54/person. This is on the pricier side compared to other high tea places but it helps a lot if you grab their offered Groupon deal (2 for 1 with free 2 hr parking). 

Firstly, service was really polite and nice, and we never felt rushed to leave like some high tea places. 

I chose their Lavender Earl Grey tea. It was a lovely blend of those flavours and I never needed a refill of hot water since is came in a large french press.

My favourite of the tiers for high tea is always the savoury bottom tier - my favourite of the bunch was the Egg Salad Croissant and the Mini Chicken Pot Pie. The scones were okay, a little dry but with the jam it helped a lot. The desserts were okay as well, the Strawberry Macaron was sadly all soft and moist by the time I ate my way to the top but I liked the Carrot Cake, light and soft. 

Overall, I had a pleasant time and the food and decor was good. It was nice to see some planes and the mountains in the window as we ate. And don't feel bad eating all those tiers of food because you can always walk it off at the new outlet by the airport as well!",2015-10-29T03:01:51Z,153
1980,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"I bought a Groupon for afternoon tea and came here for afternoon tea.  

The scones are amazing!!  The tea is also really good.   This tea comes with two glasses of sparkling wine also.  

It's cloudy and raining so didn't have a good view of runway, we can see the planes parking lot where they connect to the tunnels which was also interesting.",2016-10-08T21:58:58Z,153
1981,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"*This review is strictly for the High Tea. Unfortunately, the Fairmont doesn't have a separate category on Yelp for this*

My review is very similar to Elegance's afternoon tea review. 

I had never tried High Tea before and wasn't sure that tiny little sandwiches, pastries and tea were worth the extraordinary prices that go along with the High Tea experience. However, with a $54 Groupon for two people, which included two hours of free parking, a girlfriend and I decided to try it out.

I was impressed that my reservation, and Groupon, were accepted on the Monday of Thanksgiving weekend. As it was a holiday, I wasn't sure that my request would be honoured. 

My girlfriend and I arrived on time and we were seated right away. We were told our server would be right with us and we were given a few minutes to look over the menu. Finally, our server came, introduced herself, and asked if we had High Tea before. We both said no, so she explained a few things on the menu for us. Unfortunately, they were out of at least three teas that were listed on the menu. I opted for the chocolate flavoured tea (which was delicious). 

It took a few minutes for our teas to arrive and quite a long time for our tier of food to come. I made a comment to my friend that something as simple as pre-made pastries and a couple tiny sandwiches shouldn't take more than the 10+ minutes we waited for them. Were they going out to get the ingredients? Anyway, it finally came and the gentleman who brought them to our table kindly explained what everything was (side note: I wish he had been our server. He was friendly and bubbly and actually seemed to enjoy his job). 

We were both happy enough with the food. It was pretty good (although the desserts were far too sweet. There should have been more savory items to balance out all the sweets) and surprisingly filling enough. Service, however, was lacking. Our server never checked up on us. After she took our order, she disappeared. We had finished eating and waited forever for her to come back with our bill. We finally realized that we had been there for over TWO hours - which now meant the parking was expired and we would have to pay extra. Seriously, two hours for High Tea for just two people seems excessive. We would have been out of there much sooner had our server even bothered to check on us, but she just didn't seem to care. 

We also got the 2 for 1 coupon (as mentioned in Elegance's review) and probably won't use it, simply because of the service. 

Disappointed that this was related to the Fairmont brand which, in general, provides exceptional service.",2015-10-21T17:18:34Z,153
1982,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"This hotel is great ! What a wonderful idea to have a hotel
In the airport, where you can rent half days ( for those with a layover - how perfect ! ) 
The decor is upscale- not quite as trendy / modern as Fairmount Pacific Rim but not as stuffy or outdated as Fairmount Vancouver on Georgia.

You take an escalator or elevator upstairs , then you cross a walkway that resembles a runway .., just figured that one out !!

Then you hit reception where there are cozy lobby chairs . From there you take another Elevator up to the rooms - no key card required ! 

Rooms are spacious, beds are comfy with plush duvets. Bathrooms are large with a soaker tub, freestanding shower, And Private toilet area.

The toiletries are Rose 31, a big improvement on what Fairmount had in the past.

Robes And fluffy towels, desk, mini bar, safe and other amenities are provided.

Although you may over look the runway, the glass is soundproof, allowing quality rest and relaxation.

Staff seems friendly enough - without being over bearing .

All in all, you can't go wrong.
Gotta fly !!

1983,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"I came here for Easter brunch today and had an amazing experience with my family. Loved the market style presentation for the food. They had a great selection for breads, pastries, cheeses and charcuterie. Eggs Benedict on crab cakes came out fresh, poached egg was expertly cooked not overly done and hollandaise sauce was so delicious. Today there was prime rib roast and lamb roast. They have a variety of unique marinated vegetables and salads. Dim sum good variety but not too authentic. Seafood selection really stood out. Fresh oysters shucked on the half shell, two types of smoked salmon, candied salmon, sesame crusted tuna sashimi, cocktail shrimp and Dungeness crab legs. Everything tasted really fresh. They have a buffet table just for little ones. Lots is easter treats. Service was excellent as expected from Fairmont. The loose leaf tea really stood out. Had the earl gray and green tea and both really pleasing. Dessert and fruit options not as large selection but still enjoyable. Loved the strawberry compote cheesecake.

1984,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"Being the only hotel directly connected to the airport, I would have understood if this hotel weren't run as primly and properly as others. I've often found that super-convenient monopoly locations like these can tend to slip a bit when it comes to customer service. Not so in the case of the Fairmont Vancouver Airport.

They have an in-airport check-in desk for members of their loyalty program, and even though we were there after midnight, a member of staff was present with our room keys already prepared. 

The room was huge, with a view of the terminal (we had booked the lowest rate so I was surprised they provided this nice touch as other hotels would still have tried to nickel and dime an upgrade) and the fixtures and in-room amenities were outstanding. 

We were travelling during a slow period and were able to get a great rate (rates for this hotel are typically much higher) but now that I know the value of the hotel, I won't mind paying a bit more for the convenience and comfort. Thank you Fairmont YVR!",2018-05-19T20:23:52Z,153

1986,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"This hotel is a guaranteed pit stop for all our trips due to its spectacular location. Having family in BC, flying in from Calgary to most Southeast Asian destinations, this hotel certainly offers luxurious accomodations. 

For this year, our stay was a comfortable layover to a 1:15AM flight to Manila. We checked in between 6-7PM on December 18, had our steamy showers, room serviced dinner and checked out at 11PM with a fully refreshed toddler. It could not have been a better decision or alternative to milling the airport lounges with a toddler for 5 hours prior to boarding. 

The downside is their day rates only go until 8PM. A lot of Asian flights leave in the wee hours of morning and it would have been nice to not have to pay full price for a less than 5 hour stay in the room. 

Another nitpicky detail is that room service dinner does not come with bread or dinner rolls. We paid about $70 with 18% gratuity for a cup of seafood chowder, a vanilla milkshake from the kids menu and a turkey BLT. That's crazy steep even for Vancouver but I guess they're in business from weary travelers like us who were paying for convenience more than actual food.

1987,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"Fairmont 

Our room was very nicely laid out. I appreciated how the bathroom had it's own door so that I could have some privacy. The bathtub was jetting and they give you bath salts. I stayed in the tub for a good hour. I 
briefly had a nap. 

The swimming pool was shallow and not that long. More suitable for lower leg workouts. The deepest the pool got was 4"". I used the hot tub and met some cool people. 

They do have a gym which is more extensive with up to date equipment compared to most hotels that I've been to. The only downside is that the circuit training is geared more toward the lower body for jet leg. Nothing for total body workout. I did some yoga before bed back in my room. 

The change room for the pool and gym offers complimentary hair spray, however, the smell of the spray was horrible. 

We had our own private concierge on our floor and unlimited access to the business lounge that had private breakfast in the am, honour bar, tapas in the evening and desserts. The spreads were actually decent. We sat by the window over looking the planes. We wanted to make sure no luggage was dropped. We made happy faces with most of our meals. They had a nice 10,000 coffee maker that made decent drinks.

So I returned today with my sister hoping to share the experience with our daughters, we had reservations for 3:30pm but got there early and were accommodated.  Our server was awful and completely ruined the experience.  She was slow, and rude - clearly wasn't happy to work there.  All she did was bring out our tea, someone else (who was friendly) brought out our tiers of treats.

It took us two hours to get out of there because of our lazy, rude and very crappy server.  She never asked if we needed anything more and it was a pain trying to order champagne - took forever to get our bill at the end.  Other diners were irritated with her as well.  We won't be going back - and will definitely not recommend.  It's sad because the first experience was so wonderful - but I won't spend so much $$$ and risk having bad service.",2016-12-05T06:36:18Z,153
1992,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"If you need a hotel at the airport, you can't beat staying at a hotel INSIDE the airport. I am a big fan of Fairmont hotels, and this was nice. If you need a place to stay while waiting for an early morning flight, you can't beat staying at a place right above the terminal.

Our room was had a huge bathroom, and a nice view of the mountains and the runway. Being so close to the airplanes, you don't really hear much noise (not many flights at night, anyway). The room is tastefully decorated, and has all of the necessary electronic amenities that you would need.

I didn't eat at the hotel, so I can't comment on the food. We had a car during our stay, and they offer parking in the parade for 15.00 a night, which is very reasonable. If you need a hotel at the airport, or even a hotel in Richmond, you can't do better than this Fairmont.",2015-09-19T20:24:39Z,153
1993,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,Courteous staff. Convenient. Rooms are not insulated well from hall noise. Bring ear plugs. I have been craving a great burger for months and finally found one here on the bar menu. Perfectly cooked and flavored. Only reason I am giving 4 stars is the hall noise. There needs to be more effort into muffling noise in the hall and adding some insulation around door frame.,2018-11-11T06:42:55Z,153
1994,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"This review is for the hotel and the restaurant.

The bed. Let's just say that I didn't like it. I was surprised at the quality of the bed in the room compared to the price I paid for the room. The floor of the room did not seem to have been vacuumed very well, and the bathroom had a slightly distinctive aroma. The customer service on the hotel side was good.

My girlfriend had one of those coupons for the high tea. It's good she had a coupon because the food quality was not so good. This is the second time we've been disappointed with this. We will not make the same mistake again. The customer service was okay on the restaurant side, though I detected a bit of change in demeanor after the gf said she had a coupon.",2015-10-23T13:10:15Z,153
1995,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"If you like plane watching this is the hotel for you. Really enjoyed watching planes land, take off from the floor to ceiling windows. Wicked comfortable bed and a five minute walk to my gate the next day.

Good value too, just over $200 for a luxury hotel is quite good. Make sure you've hot you plane finding app and live air traffic control app and you can listen and watch the planes come in.

See you next time Fairmont YVR!",2013-10-12T15:31:36Z,153
1996,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,Stayed one night at this hotel by the airport from a very long trip in Cambodia and China. Very convenient close by the airport no need to take another rides outside the airport. The food was okay not much selection because of our dietary restrictions. Not much choice in halal menu. There was better halal selections in Japan airport which our family stayed one night.,2020-09-19T21:41:23Z,153
1997,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"Pros:
* Comfy bed
* Lots of water pressure in the shower
* Cool view of the runways and minimal plane noise
* Can't beat the location for an early morning flight - you're already there!

Cons:
* $15 wifi. Usually don't need wifi as I have a great data plan for US/Canada. But my Verizon/Bell data was crapping out so I tried wifi to check in online. I got a shock to find a hotel that still charges for wifi. And $15. Dear Fairmont: it's 2016 - include wifi. (So that's why they get 2 stars off...pretty inconvenient when you really need it)",2016-03-14T19:19:21Z,153
1998,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"This hotel is so convenient and easily the best airport hotel I have stayed in, anywhere in the world.

Staff are accommodating, the rooms are spacious with views of the runway, and quiet.

I have found the bar staff at Globe quite surly and unfriendly, so now I just go downstairs to Vino Volo right at US arrivals when I want a snack and glass of wine.

The Gold lounge like all Fairmonts has a nice spread of breakfast and afternoon food.

All in all, a great property, have never used the spa so can't comment.  Easy to get to and from anywhere in airport.",2013-04-23T18:06:01Z,153
1999,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"Never in the world have I been to a more airport-convenient hotel.  The Fairmont is not only near, adjacent, or whatever those other terms hotels use, but it's ON the airport property, literally an escalator-ride down from check-in.  You don't get any more convenient!

It's Canadian-clean, nice accommodations, good service, and a will-do-again.",2013-05-23T15:38:01Z,153
2000,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"THIS HOTEL IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!

I don't know what it is about Canadians, but they are the friendliest people! And when I checked into Fairmont, I felt like I was being welcomed into a friend's home. 

The decor is very modern and the lighting helps with the soothing ambiance. When I made my way to my room, I was impressed by the look of the elevators and how fast they were. Is that weird? I mean, sometimes hotel elevators are slow. And that is not cool. Especially after a long trip.

Let me talk about my room, though! Oh my... when I walked into my room, I was so surprised by how luxurious it looked! There was a full sized tub with a separate shower. And the lighting in the room was amazing. Sometimes hotel rooms lack lighting, but this room was so bright. And I think that added to the overall welcoming feeling. Although the hotel is attached to the airport, I never once heard a plane during my stay. 

I love, love, love this hotel. And I cannot wait to be back.",2015-06-05T19:10:56Z,153
2001,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,"A truly outstanding hotel, location in the airport notwithstanding. You'll find it just off the US Departures terminal, so once you're in the airport just head to the US departures area and you can't miss the hotel's grand escalators commanding the entrance. 

We arrived in Vancouver around 1:30am and I can't express how much of a relief it was to walk directly from picking up our baggage over to the hotel and be in our room and in bed within a matter of minutes! The Canada Line SkyTrain (built in 2009 for the 2010 Olympics) is attached to the airport next to the hotel, so getting downtown is a real breeze and takes under 30 minutes door-to-door. On our way out from the city we stayed here too, and getting to the check-in for our 7am flight was a total stress-free breeze.

Aside from the brilliant convenience, the amenities at this hotel are wonderful. The entrance, common areas, lobby, restaurant and bar are all beautiful and relaxing. Modern but cozy, there are a couple of huge gas fireplaces in the lobby where you can sit and enjoy the quiet serenity of planes landing and taking off with the stunning backdrop of mountains. Staff here are on their game more than most places - so efficient at the front desk, eager to help, and wonderfully gracious in the Globe lounge where we had our breakfast (there is a package the includes 2 train tickets and 2 breakfast buffets - great deal). I used the fitness room, which is attached to the spa and adjacent to the pool, and it overlooks the Delta check-in area which was a little strange at first, but then became somewhat entertaining once I got into the voyeur aspect of it.

Our room was large and spacious as others have mentioned, complete with a phone that had a touch screen that controlled everything from the lights in the bathroom to the television. Le Labo Rose 31 toiletries, just like most Fairmonts - I love Le Labo!! From our room, we had amazing views of the runway and Mount Baker in the background. Despite the proximity to the planes, the room was blissfully quiet.

This hotel is one of those places that relaxes you immediately, and provides a real oasis from the hustle and bustle of downtown, although still providing you with great access to just about everything. It's also a wonderful base if you're looking to explore Richmond (home to the 2nd largest Asian community in North America) and all the wonderful food there, just a few stops away on the SkyTrain. If you've got inconvenient flights in/out of Vancouver, do yourself a favor and stay here!",2013-10-07T13:14:50Z,153
2002,Fairmont Vancouver Airport,4.0,Review of the Bar. Here for meetings. Happened to be the final game of the WS. Guitar player on site singing music to kill yourself by. Quite skilled. Bartenders look as though they are seriously considering it. Most morose dead to the world bartenders I've encountered in a while. Passable service but all the staff appeared to have been fired minutes before I arrived lol. Maybe the music but all in all the most depressing bar I have been in for quite a while.,2018-10-29T03:34:13Z,153
2003,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"After golf it was dinner time so we headed back into town and ended up at the Starlight Casino buffet for dinner.  One of the guys had a VIP card so we ended up paying $13 each for the buffet!  Cheap but not worth the 13 dollars!  

Veggies: the corn was ok but I think overall undercooked and difficult to eat! 

Chicken stir fry:  gamy and scary to eat!  

Roast Beef:  tougher than shoe leather!  

Salmon:  dry and flavorless!  

Clam chowder soup:  watered down to the point of absurdity

Pasta:  pretty bad!  I think it was the leftovers from lunch!  I'm serious!  

I had only 1 dessert... A tiny silk cake. It was ok. I think it came out of a package!  

I felt queasy, but I tried to sample a bit of everything. 30 minutes into dinner I dropped anchor.  When I came back I stopped eating.  

Overall, save your money and go home and eat!  Or go to McDonalds and eat like a King!",2014-04-29T18:05:37Z,239
2004,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"YES.  I'm a fan of River Rock casino here in Richmond.   I have to preface I have never stayed here but I've played here enough times to know this can be a really fun place anytime during the week.  

The casino itself is a good size, filled with a variety of table games and slots.  My first visit here was a little too smokey for me, but I have a feeling that will be changed soon if it hasn't already been done already.  

The boardwalk on the outside of the casino is nice for a stroll during the day or night.  Also, there are a lot of big names that come out here fairly often, so this casino is a real nice addition to the city of Richmond.",2008-08-13T10:09:20Z,239
2005,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"We were attracted to River Rock because of their pool for our kids. We stayed on a Friday night in a 2 bedroom suite and enjoyed it.  We decided to visit again for another two days but opted to upgrade to the penthouse at a significant cost so that we can have two bathrooms.  Unfortunately we checked in late and after dinner and swimming we went to shower in our room and there is no hot water in one of the two bathrooms.  The master bathroom had hot water but it had a very strong smell of cigarette smoke which made us sick.all the towels soaked up the cigarette smell too and was disgusting to use.  We made the best of it and put the kids to bed.  I went to make a hot cup of tea and inside the kettle the bottom was all rusted.  

We are local and this was a staycation.  Kids went to school and when I finally got a chance to call the hotel about the issues at 4:30 they assured me they would look after the problems if I came back after dinner.  We got back to our room late and absolutely nothing was done.  We showered in the smoky bathroom again and put kids to bed again.  I politely spoke to the concierge and asked for the manager on duty.  She did call the manager but had to first tell me that the water kettles may look dirty but it's not rust.  I was shocked that she wouldn't just say sorry and they would switch it out.  Luckily I had a picture to show her.  When I got to speak with the manager Sasha she was a bit cold but offered me something right away. Her offer of a free upgrade to a penthouse for my next stay was just not good enough. My whole stay was miserable and I kept thinking of how bad our experience was for two days.  Her other offer was $200 off per night and room charges waived. This was not great but she had nothing else to offer.  We basically paid $699 for 1 smoky  bathroom to use whereas before our upgrade it cost us $329.  It was too late to do anything so we went to bed and checked out the next morning.  At check out instead of the $200 discount per night we got $200 total and the waived room charges was a random $53 and not all of them.  

I had to wait until the afternoon for the manager Sasha to call me back.  When she did her tone changed and was even worse. She basically told me it is what it is.  She didn't try to understand that I paid a huge premium to be able to use two bathrooms.  $100 off per night was a slap in my face in my opinion.  This is how you treat your customers that upgrafe to penthouse suites?  Really? She did waive the rest of the minor room charges and offered a free upgrade for my next visit. I got a generic invoice through their reservation email afterwards.  No thank you or contact name and no free upgrade on a future visit.  

I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. The pool is good but not good enough to justify their operations.  Forget the pool and enjoy the downtown hotels instead.  We stayed at L'hermitage the week before and they were amazing.  Free valet service, a very excellent breakfast buffet, clean rooms and the staff are amazing. They meet and greet you by name everywhere.",2018-01-25T03:43:39Z,239
2006,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"This review is just on the resort itself. I'm not a gambler so losing money and experiences regarding gambling will not be in this review. We went for my birthday and thought it'll be a good place to stay. 

The overnight parking and the area itself is a little unorganized. There's road work around and it's right near the sky train. Parking lot is right when you come in the road to the resort but the hotel and resort itself is at the end of the road. You'd want to park your car in the valet area of the hotel, check in then come back out to park the car and walk back to the hotel. It will kind of suck if you have a lot of luggage to haul with you. The walk itself from the parking garage to the hotel/resort isn't too bad.

Our room was next to the sky train station but it's very insulated because we barely heard anything. The 3 of us shared a 2 queen size bed room. It was spacious and clean. The bathroom is roomy and clean too. The resort is smoke free!! YAY!!! My mom and I have asthma so breathing in smoke makes us cough really bad. There wasn't even a hint of smoke smell in the resort..not even the casino which is awesome! There's a snack/food area in the casino which we ate. It was pretty decent for ""fast casino food"". 

Overall, the resort was nice, clean and no smoking smell! Staff is friendly and accommodating. It's nearby all the places we'd go. Free wifi and parking too! We'll definitely stay here next time.",2015-04-22T21:22:33Z,239
2007,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"Fantastic! Thanks so much for the excellent service and stay. I would also like to extend a thank you to the management of the Resort Hotel. We were staying with friends that were having a bad experience with other accommodations in Richmond and we suggested River Rock may suit our needs better. The staff went above and beyond getting us sorted. The rooms were clean and welcoming, we went for dinner at the buffet and it was fantastic. I will definitely be back. 
Thank You!",2017-09-05T12:56:32Z,239
2008,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"This is one of my favorite hotels in Vancouver. Room is clean, close to night market, The Curve restaurant serves great food, and the indoor water slide is a plus. 

The reason why it didn't give it a 5 star is at check-in, I have encountered people cutting in line. The last time I checked, this is a classy hotel so you think the staff would informed the guests to wait for their turn. I brought this up with the customer service person at the concierge desk and even completed a comment card so upper management can fix the problem. I recently stayed again at this hotel assuming the cutting in line was going to be fixed. But NO, it was not. People once again was cutting in line. What does it take to put a simple rope or one of retractable things at the airport so people would know where to stand. 

I was informed from the guest services that it's part of the culture at this hotel to let people cut in line that they can't change it. You can see my jaw wide open at this point and astounded by the guest services response. I guess it doesn't matter how great your hotel is ....but if you don't have order and great customer service, your hotel is NOT that great . I hope this comment gets to you so the next time someone stays at your hotel, people won't cut in line when checking in.",2016-01-13T17:51:54Z,239

2010,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"Go for the events but bypass the buffet!

River Rock brings in some interesting acts (intermingled with some crazy ones as well) and I found myself going there with a group of friends a couple months ago.

We decided that to save time we would try out the buffet before the show.  Yikes!  Mistake.  I've been to my share of casinos and know my way around a buffet but this was more like a family get together potluck.

The food was overcooked, half the trays were empty, and food was dribbled all over the place.  The quality of food I tried was not on par with anything found in Reno or Vegas.

Next time, we will skip the buffet and pack a granola bar in our pocket.  Fortunately, the venue was good and we enjoyed the show (hence, 3 stars).",2009-11-15T23:38:54Z,239
2011,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"The greatest feature of this casino (and most casinos in Canada in general,versus most casinos in the US)  is that it is non-smoking throughout -- and this alone is enough to have my business. 

This casino cannot be compared to those in Vegas.  It will never look or feel  like Vegas, and I don't think they intend to mimic Vegas in any way. This place has its own unique personality and charm that once you walk in, you feel comfortable.  It is small enough to give you an intimate feel, but big enough to offer a wide array of dining and entertainment options.

It has plenty of slots to satisfy most players' preference. I play mostly penny slots with 30 - 50 lines and they have plenty of those. There are also many table games but I rarely play them. 

Other cool things include plenty of free parking, very favorable rates and no fees for foreign currency exchange, free soft drinks for players ( no free alcohol which is a good thing if you gamble), and live entertainment at night. The staff has always been pleasant and friendly every time we've been there. 

We visit the River Rock casino every time we're in the Vancouver area and we will continue to do so in the future.",2013-09-12T17:48:33Z,239
2012,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"River Rock Casino Resort hosts a New Year's Eve event annually. There was no entrance fee for the New Year's Eve event. It was open and free to everyone. People could choose to dine at their food court, or inside the Curve Lounge, or at the New Year's Eve Gala Buffet featuring all-you-can-eat Prime Rib and Dungeness Crab. Their NYE buffets offered 3 seatings at 2pm, 5pm and 8pm. Curve Lounge is also a good option to dine in a private space since it is roped off from the crowd, and still allows guests to watch the acrobatics show from the lounge. There was a guitar musician on stage in front of the Curve entertaining the audience in the early evening. At 9:00pm, there was an acrobatics performance by The Underground Circus. The acrobatics show was full of talented performers, weaving their way in and out of intricate shaped objects in the air to lively pumping music. One of the stunning parts of the show was when a pair of aerial tap dancers danced, swung around the ropes, and tapped their way on plexiglass stages high up in the air. The show ended an hour later, and a DJ came up to start music for the dance floor. The crowd was mostly in the 30's - 50's age range but the younger crowd would probably start trickling in later in the evening. There was a red car prize draw (beside the stage), and a beautifully sculpted real ice bar inside the casino. It looked like glass at first, until upon closer inspection, there is a tray area to catch the slowly melting ice. The ice bar was cash only, so if you come here for NYE next time, make sure you bring some cash for the bars. There was also a musical dedicated to the late Temptations in the River Rock Show theatre, which required ticket purchases and had started selling since late October.

The only funny incident I had was when a casino security guard told me I had to be over 30 years old to enter the casino. (Update: found out that he was just joking). I took some lovely shots and footage to make a River Rock Casino NYE video. We didn't stay till Countdown because we had a small house party to attend and rushed to that at 11pm, so I wasn't able to see what the Casino did for midnight countdown. Overall, it was a great experience, and I recommend it to locals in the Richmond area and to tourists for a future New Year's celebration. You don't necessarily have to be a gambler or poker player to enjoy the evening, since you could book a hotel suite, dine at the buffet or lounge or food court, watch the concert or attend the theatre, acrobatics show, enter the prize draws, and dance the evening away.",2018-01-03T04:47:44Z,239
2013,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"This casino situated on the shores of the Fraser River is by far one of Vancouver's gems. It has plenty of slot machines and plenty of table games with side rooms with table games and slot games alike for those who seek more of a private or more quiet atmosphere while gambling. The River Rock is easily accessible by transit( Canada Line) from Waterfront Stn to Bridgeport Stn. From the Airport on the Canada Line  and from Richmond Brighouse  as well as the many buses or options of uber or taxi are for you. This casino and facility is top notch with great friendly and knowledgeable staff any of the casinos ever have. They do a remarkable job to make sure you are safe should you win a nice size jackpot and security here does a top notch job to see to it you get home safe. I highly recommend this casino for a night out of gambling and fun if that's on your itinerary whether your a local or a tourist, its a game of hit or miss and gamble responsibly, never gamble more than your willing to lose. Have fun, that's what its all about.",2024-04-01T07:35:01Z,239
2014,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"The review will include casino, hotel (although no in room picture) and the food court in the casino. Ultimately it earns 3 stars at best for all around experience. Yes, there is a lot of parking at this casino, however I find that it falters in its accessibility. The elevators pictured almost never work, or so outdated where the buttons don't light up when you call them (so you don't even know if they are coming to your floor or not), and the entire place reeks of smoke. While I understand that they may not be responsible for people smoking or not, it doesn't make for a very welcoming and safe area either as taking the stairs down as well can be a little challenging if you are exiting the casino at off-hours or in the middle of the night. I personally dislike when my family heads or for a casino night on the basis of its safeness. If you have difficulty with mobility or are elderly requiring assistance, I highly recommend that you have somebody drop you off at the entrance.

The hotel staff are nice enough, but I believe the pandemic really changed this experience overall with lack of staffing and likely people just being overworked. Our room plus suite was nice and spacious however there were dirty sheets with crumbs in the pull out couch. We had called housekeeping and the housekeeper who came to us was very nice and apologetic and change it for us right away we had no problems with her. Pull out couches are difficult as is because sometimes they do not get used so while the sheets may be clean people sit on the couch and eat and crumbs fall through.. Either way, it didn't leave a great feeling for my stay and the beds seemed pretty outdated as well and poor support/creaky. As a note, the last time we were there, there was only one staff on duty for checkout and a bit of a line. I know this can again be a staffing issue, however just be prepared to have a buffer for leaving the hotel.

The casino itself is busy and has a variety of slots and tables. We often stick to the slots and sometimes you just can't get on the machine you want to because of it's popularity! Also if you go during the summer night market, be prepared for it to be extra busy because many guests like to park in the hotel parking and walk through the casino or spend some time there before heading out to the night market. I like the food court area and often gravitate towards the Chinese eatery for comfort or we grab a burger and fries. It is relatively affordable and the portions are good sizes. The staff are very friendly here as well, especially the ones that clean up the tables.",2022-09-30T17:05:32Z,239
2015,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,The main restaurant Quail Run was closed on a Saturday during a 3 day weekend and the backup was the Bar and Grill with a 1 1/2 hour wait.  I will never return.,2024-02-19T01:09:34Z,239
2016,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"We stayed here because it's walking distance from the night market and rather than going through the hassle of driving and trying to get out of the parking lot when it's crowded, we decided to stay here to be able to walk there instead, it's about a 6 minutes walk depending on how heavy your food coma is. 

Rooms were decent, parking at the main garage was free which is kind of unheard of. However if you're staying in the newer side in the south tower, you do have the option to pay $3 a day for closer parking. It's nice to not have to walk further to the other garage, but my only complaint is that the paid garage smells like pee so I actually recommend not parking at the few spots right next to the elevator, the smell goes away a row down.

I was worried that staying at a casino will smell like cigarettes, but none of that. Now onto the good part, the water slide! It's so freaking fun, I feel like a kid again with no worries going down the water slide. Thumbs up for any hotel with water slides.

2017,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,Now to be honest this place has gone way down since they cracked down on the money laundering. I found this place to be boring the service in the bar area by the set of stairs immediately behind the revolving doors was terrible and hr to get appy's and 20 min to get a drink when your arms reach of the bar is ridiculous. And it's not like the food is extraordinarily sophisticated. The casino floor is bleh and there's an unreal number of slot machines. They got rid of the stage were they had the live entertainment and put a Dj in a wee spot on the corner behind some potted plants. I'm not a gambler so I was less than impressed.

2018,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"Don't forget resort fee. Free parking ng but you are sharing with casino goers so be patient. It is a bit of walk (west park) - outside if you are with minors. 
The hotel and casino itself is nice and well kept. 
Except the one working elevator this time on the west tower... ok it's broken but it was busy. 
Food here is good except price is as you expect it. The place that you could say Starbucks was the cheapest option for breakfast unless you go out and drive Tim Horton is down the street.
Food court you can't bring the kids there. You can order and bring to your room (shrimp wonton soup so good) or use in suite room service but limited menu & $5 delivery vs going down stairs.
No microwave in the room and the vending machines were all sold out. 
The pool area is the best part if you have kids. It has a fun slide and semi heated pool - it's not very warm but it isn't too cold either. Plus a hot tub.

Everything looks well maintained and clean. There's lots of sanitizing wipes around, so you can wipe down your machine before you play. However, $25 min on the roulette table is too risky for me. Luckily on the roulette machines you can play as low as $1 a spin. No other complaints except turn up the music!

2026,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"Pros: 
- Conveniently located in Richmond, BC near other malls/plazas/stores; walking distance from
Richmond Night Market
- Hotel consists of two towers connected by skybridge; elevator is fast in West Tower; both buildings have drive-thru loading zones
- Main building has casino, pool, food court, buffet, Starbucks, gym, and other amenities; West Tower only has check-in desk (which is convenient because you can check in and get support regardless of which building you stay in)
- Pool is decently sized and features hot tub, shower, restrooms, limited seating, and fun water slide; pool hours are 6 am-10 pm; hotel will store baggage prior to check in so guests can swim
- Hotel offers complimentary delayed check out at noon depending on availability
- Rooms come with mini fridge and two complimentary water bottles
- Beds and pillows were comfortable
- Rooms have doorbells, which can be useful but also a nuisance

Cons:
- Overpriced--paid $499 CA per night for one room with two queen beds
- Room was clean but not the most spacious and a bit run down--for example, fridge did not cool properly, door to fridge was burnt in the corner in one of our rooms, and closet and bathroom doors were loud and squeaky
- Front desk did not answer when we called from our room phones (we tried multiple different times during our stay); room phone did not work in one of our rooms; had to visit front desk whenever we needed anything
- Key card needs to remain in key card slot by the room entrance to turn on the lights--as soon as it is removed all of the lights in the room turn off, which is an inconvenience (but possibly helpful from a power-saving standpoint)
- All amenities are located in the main building, which is a slight inconvenience for guests staying in the West Tower
- Free parking is located in the main building, which is a bit of a walk if staying in the West Tower; parking in the West Tower is $3
- Microwaves are available upon request but would rather they come standard in the rooms
- Certain parts of the floor in the pool felt like it was coming apart, leading me to believe portions of the pool floor needed repair; the shower area is open and located next to the pool as opposed to private locker room-type showers
- I do not have good luck playing slots in the casino, but some of my family members did have good luck during our last visit in July 2022
- West Tower entrance locks at 11 pm so guests are required to enter through the main building and cross via skybridge--great from a safety standpoint but not the most convenient
- Noticed some suspicious dark spots on some of the bed linens but nothing on the actual mattresses
- Would likely stay elsewhere next time solely based on the price not matching the overall experience",2022-07-06T01:27:01Z,239
2027,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"Ok, so, this was a family vacation planned for three blended families (10) and we had booked two resort rooms, at the same time, and planned for the trip. Arrived and were told that we had to take rooms in opposite towers, or we could wait and see if we could get rooms near each other, but it would be after normal check in time, and was not guaranteed. Fine, we booked opposite sides. The larger side only had one elevator working, with a full house (over 300 check ins the day we arrived-per the check in). Wait times for the elevator became sort of a joke, but again, fine, we waited. The buffet was very expensive by my standards ($50 for an adult dinner) and the lines were insane, so we used the food court. Can't take kids through the casino to get to the food court, please make sure you have a second person to watch them, just a PSA. The food was meh, but it was ok.
The rooms were nice, dated and a bit shabby, but very spacious. The front rooms face some lovely graffiti, back ones face the river. The rooms are very hot, even when the living space is cold, prepare to sleep with doors open. The gap in the bedroom doors (French doors) and the frosted glass make for a less than private space. There's a gray fridge, coffee maker and hot water electric kettle... but no microwave. You can request, but with a packed hotel, not happening. 
The pool is awesome, but needs more fitting opportunities for those who are not partaking. Pool was super chilly, hot tub was nice. 
Lots of extra fees... Lots and lots... but parking is free. Casino is cool, non smoking so that's good.
Overall, would've given 3.5 stars, but since you round up, they get 4, but probably wouldn't stay again because of random fees and no microwave.
Side note, the people were mostly nice, the small gift shop employees are very nice, prices high (expected) but there are lots of choices.

I live in Las Vegas where we have our fair share of casinos, and the vibe here kinda reminded me of the Silverton Casino, but with no empty seats, all the table games were full of people trying their luck to win it big, (Wonder if they know that the house always wins???)and it had to have been at least 95% Asian gamblers (Duh? We're in Richmond!?!?)

I like that they have security/ bag checks at all entrances and a Starbucks here. We finally found seating to enjoy our Lychee Guava Iced Tea. We spent about an hour here until it was time to get in line for the Richmond Night Market which was a 5 minute walk away. ALOHA!!!

They have a 90 minutes eating window restriction. Don't know how strictly is this enforced?.....

Majority of the food offerings were good, fresh and healthy looking.  Though the roast beef was on the tough dry side and the ham was on the underwhelming bland side.   Nothing stands out as super outer worldly, however the desserts were definitely above average.

They also don't have microwaves so you can't heat up any left over foods that you may have but they provide a mini fridge.  They charge you $25/day if you want to rent one!  Also, the air/heater doesn't make sense so there's no clear directions on it being on or off.  I had to get up few times at night to adjust the temperature since it got too hot in the room.  The bath tub was also clogged.  We had to walk through the casino to get to our room and every time they card you and they won't let you bring in food so we started walking around the casino to avoid that since we were going out and having left overs to bring back.  This hotel is definitely NOT a fit for us.  Plus we don't want to smell cigarettes when we have to walk to the garage every time.

During our time in Vancouver, we decided to stop by the River Rock Resort to check out the casino scene in the area. The casino wasn't that large, but it definitely had a different feel than other local casinos. For one, the casino was pristine and well kept. Surprise, surprise. Spacing was a bit more cramped though because the casino wasn't all that big. As for the casino floor, all of the tables were located in a middle section together, with a majority dedicated to either Baccarat (catering to the large Asian population) or Blackjack. There were also a lot of slot machines, including some new ones that we had never seen before. 

For a local casino, River Rock is not bad, but by no means does it compare to any large scale casinos operating in the U.S. There was plenty of bustle inside, but also lacked capacity.",2019-03-01T14:47:18Z,239
2036,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"Updated review for the casino after 2 years, and maintaining 4 stars.

River Rock is one of my favorite casinos, and many of the comments in my previous review still apply.  A non-smoking casino with bright lights and clocks is unheard of in the USA!  Christmas time was crazy busy for the casinos.  It was hard to get tables and the more popular games like Ultimate Holdem require tickets to secure your turn.

Some highlights of my recent visits here:

1. Free Bet Blackjack is very popular here, mostly 15 and 25 CAD tables.  If the dealer gets a 22, its not a bust but rather a push.  This is bad since you might have an awesome hand and the crappy dealer 22 just ends the hand and forces a do-over. To compensate for this, you get free double downs on hard 9,10, and 11 and free splits except 10's.  The betting strategy suggests you be more aggressive over regular blackjack due to the 22 rule.  I won on a hand of A-9 vs. dealer 6 by standing.  The correct move in this case was to treat A-9 as a ""10"" and double with real money vs. a dealer 6.  Other than that, split everything and use those hard doubles since you're gambling with free money!

2. They seem to have more Ultimate Holdem tables now, with 5, 10, and 15 CAD tables.  Its a fun game but incredibly streaky like the Stock Market this past week.  You can be down a few hundred quickly and then suddenly come roaring back with a few lucky bonus hands. I snagged a few full houses, flushes, and trips which helped put me in the green (for today at least, LOL!).  This game is not for the faint-of-heart! 

3. At night the Craps limits fell from 10 CAD to 5 CAD.  However, they only had two and not three dealers so they squished all the players on one end of the table, which was a bit hilarious but annoying as well.  

4. Pai Gow Poker has 25 CAD limits, and if you play with this limit I strongly recommend consistently betting at least 5 CAD on the Fortune Bonus.  It may not pay frequently, but you will be thankful when it does.  I hit a Straight Flush which brought me back to even on 50:1 payoff. My table mates were also happy in that they got 20 CAD each as an Envy bonus.  

5. The casino added a brand spanking food court since my last visit which seemed to have decent ramen and Chinese food - they must given that it seems like 90% of the customer base are Chinese!

Looking forward to making a visit to River Rock an annual family tradition!",2018-12-28T00:53:08Z,239
2037,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"We stayed here overnight due to its close proximity to the Richmond Night Market. While the proximity was nice, there a few things that detracted from the quality of the stay unfortunately. For one, when we got into our room, we noticed there were yellow stains on one set of bedsheets and an oily stain on the other. There was also a long, black hair stuck in the sheets as well. Thankfully, they were prompt about getting new linens put on upon request. The shower drain also wasn't working properly so the four of us had to shower ankle deep in water. Again not an ideal experience. The nightstand was also covered in dust. The room just didn't have a very clean feel to it, which detracted from the overall comfort of the stay.

The casino isn't very large either. They have the race to win promo where you can win a car when you play certain slot machines near the front entrance. They have other slots both old and new games. 

They also have table games. I've only ever played Roulette once. I think I won 70$. Needless to say, I am not much of a gambler.  

They have 2 hotels, one where the casino is located and one directly across. They are both decent hotels 3.5 I'd rate them. The suites here are quite nice and some are huge! 

They also have a lounge outside the casino that is nice. Sometimes they have live music. The buffet wasn't great ( check my review of it ) They also have a theatre where they have Bands.

2040,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"Worst casino/ hotel I ever stayed in. From the start I was treated bad by the way I looked. I ride motorcycles around the world for 6 months at a time I also love poker. I was greeted by a reception that immediately judged a guy in a dirty KLIM motorcycle outfit who has been camping out and riding around Canada and Alaska for the last 4 months.  I told them I got hit by a car and would appreciate it if I could park somewhere close to the hotel entrance since I had so many motorcycle bags and gear to carry and was limping since I was injured from the accident and needed to go to the hospital for x-rays. They didn't even tell me I could use the valet parking area,, an option I would have used.. I also did not get any bellboy bag service  ,, something u would expect when u spend over $1100 dollars for the room , nope!  Even after I was able to park in the valet area and carry my own bags back and forth limping through the hotel, even told the valet guy about my accident , whom I later saw on my 2nd trip from my motorcycle helping the next guests out of a Mercedes with a baggage trolley, why wasn't I offered this service I'm a paying guest as well? I also was surprised that they didn't offer any laundry service, for over $300 a night room they made me take a can to a questionable part of town to do my own laundry at a laundromat! Hahah wtf? 
All I wanted on my way back from alaska and the Yukon was a place to play poker , which I love. Nope I end up getting kicked out of the poker room because I vented my frustration when the waitress asked me what I wanted, I said I want a 20yr + scotch whatever u have , Macallan,  Balvenie NEAT, whatever  u have,  nope can't have that. U have to have it with a mixer, I said huh? I don't want a mixer I don't want to ruin the integrity of the scotch. They didn't understand , when I asked why she said because the alcohol goes right in yer blood stream , I said huh? What kind of mixer do you need to add to a beer ? This was actually ridiculous , so if u want to order a 25 year mcallans u have to mix it with soda or coke or sumthin, then she said I could add ice that's considered a mixer  what? But I don't want a cold watered down scotch I want it room temp.. NOPE sorry not here and that's not why I got kicked out of the poker room, I got kicked out because I wanted to buy another player  a Johnny walker and since he had been cut off, they pulled me aside and said I was cut off. I said what? Nobody cut me off, u got me mixed up with the other guy, the waitress said he was cut off because he ordered his last drink at 12:36 and it was only 1:28 and he has to wait 8 more minutes to get another drink. I was like what? Seriously? What is this school house rock. Honeycomb hideout bullshit? Do I have to ask my parents if I'm allowed to stay up late? This is ridiculous.  I'm a 48 yo man if ya wanna cut me off fine, but when everyone at the poker table is like thus guy is great he is fun he isn't casting any trouble the floor man doesn't care. He just doesn't like someone who looks like me , dressed down ( and I do have money,  I do, but that's neither here nor there) thus casino/hotel is NOT CANADA! This was my first time.to Canada and I have nothing but the best to say about Canadians, they are the most friendly, outgoing,  helpful  non abrasive people I've ever met, these people running the casino and hotel are not canadian. This is not a good representation of Canada what so ever. 
I'm so flabbergasted at the events that unfolded. There was a local poker player throwing the f word around telling the floor men to fuck off and he gets to stay but me, a guy wanting to buy a player adrink  , having fun and playing cards gets tossed because I don't have designer clothes or dress up, I'm sorry I don't carry fancy clothes with me when I'm camping and riding motorcycle around the country for months on end all I have with me is tools and parts. There was one casino worker who was very nice , I'm angry I can't remember his name I wanna say Terrance but it's probably wrong,  he has glasses,  older gentlemen  very nice , treated me with respect and understood  my grievance for being told to mix Hugh end scotch  with a mixer. I mean that us suck a travesty!  Don't stay here , don't give them the  satisfaction of staying here. It's the worst casino/hotel I've ever been at. Go elsewhere!!!

Their valet closed at that time.  Upon arrival at the check in, told we got an upgrade to a 2 bedrooms suite.  Hooray....but the downside is that we had to cross the street to the other side to go through the check in process again, kinda cumbersome while having to haul the luggages, deal with tired kids and pouring rain.  I'd say this process is not friendly at all. 
The room was great and roomy.  Beds were comfortable and were king beds.

2046,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"OK...I got upgraded to the executive suite in the West Tower.  +1 Star!  I'm a sucker for upgrades - Who isn't?

The suite has a walk down from the entry into the living area.  This increased the height of the room to close to 10' - very comfortable and airy.
The place was a little dated - I think the place is over 13 years but the hotel towers are probably not as old.  Some of the furnishing were chipped and the granite on the sink also had a crack in it.  Nonetheless, it is a spacious and comfortable room for a couple of nights and the furniture isn't mine - so whatever.  The two large TVs and the Nespresso machine + Mighty Leaf teas are a good touch.  The view from the hotel is nice overlooking the water and the marina.

For those of you who like the nightlife, food, and yes...losing large...you came to the right place.  They have sprawling square footage of noisy machines, lots of card tables, and the obligatory buffet - not cheap!  There are award winning chefs at the main resto and your happy bar with live music.

Hmmm...where did they fall short?
First of all, the shower is a petty little thing compared to my monsoon shower at home.  A lot of my reviews talk about how I dislike the showers at hotels.  For the cash we pay, can we not be afforded just a reasonable amount of water so I can get the days grime off?
As I was in Vancouver for business, it would be nice to have decent Internet.  I found the speed slow overall.  I could do most of my standard biz stuff on it but making calls though my VoIP app was difficult and streaming any content was unpleasant.
One more thing, the parking is quite a bit away from the main entrance of the casino.  When dragging the luggage around, it gets downright bothersome.  They do have a valet service...hmmm...I wonder how much of that would be used if the parking wasn't a marathon?

Lucky they gave me the upgrade right!  :))

2047,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"We stayed here one night. Booked through Expedia and friends that had booked the same room in my tower through the hotel got upgraded to stay at the hotel for free ( FYI ). Check in was easy the lady who checked me in wasn't very friendly but gave good directions for the free parking garage and the hotel. 

The hotel room was really pretty and the elevators fast. Seemed like a quiet weekend as it was extremely silent in the room didn't hear a peep all night and my friends who stayed at the casino heard a dog bark all night and were super annoyed. The beds seemed comfortable but were not as my mom and I both woke up feeling sore.  My friends had suites on top of the casino overlooking the river and the rooms were really pretty , worth the upgrade but maybe loader as more people staging there ...

The reason only three stars as when I went to take a shower I couldn't figure out how to get the shower working ( didn't read the check in paperwork you pull the spout ) and when I pulled the bath mat up to take a bathe I found three long black hairs under the mat. Totally gross and I was the first one in the shower. I am sure they just forgot to wash the mat but gross . Otherwise it was a nice stay and wish the beds were more comfortable.. oh and the pizza in the casino was the worse pizza I have had . Got the meat lovers 8 inch and was all bread and hardly any cheese and the meat was gross .. also the gambling was fun but tables too high limit and slots didn't pay much .. but it was a sat night and typical

I don't gamble but it looks like the zombies are having fun pulling the levers. I have tried other hotels in the area and I keep coming back to the River Rock. This place rocks!",2019-05-15T14:33:52Z,239
2049,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"I ended up going here because of Groupon it was a deal too good to pass up! the hotel itself was very clean and spacious everyone was hella friendly. 

The food from the bar was delicious they had a good variety of places to choose from.  their gift shop however did not have any swim caps which kind of annoyed me they do have a swimming pool though with a small slide my kids enjoyed that part other than that it's not much to do but to go to the casino.

it is conveniently located to downtown, grocery stores and fast food places

id give the casino 4 stars: no machines were out of order, no smoking, fun games, easy layout, In the fact that they actually monitored who came in and out via checking ID.

When you first sign up for their member account you get $10 to play.

The buffet cost about $40 a person and it's not what you get at Spirit Mountain Casino this food is more healthier you only want one serving so overall I felt like it was a waste of money.

Be sure to sign up for your membership account before you eat so you can get the discount I think it's only 7% or 10% but it's something!",2018-05-21T23:31:04Z,239
2050,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"I've been coming to the River Rock Casino since it opened. It has a good vibe and the employees are friendly. However over the past several years they have gotten rid of all the old style slot machines. Most have been replaced by VLT type machines.  The place is top heavy with them.

It's too bad they don't realize that not everyone wants to play glorified video games.  Especially us older folks. It would be nice if they brought back some of the old style slot machines. If not, what's the point. I may as well stay home and play video games on my computer.",2022-01-31T23:42:29Z,239
2051,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"We came up here to British Columbia with five kids and stayed at the two bedroom suite. Amazing hospitality, professional staff, it was an amazing experience. Every staff member that we came across was amazing. Starting from valet the moment we arrived, housekeeping, swimming pool, the spa, I can't say enough good things about all the staff at this river rock resort. We have stayed at many hotels and we have to say that this is by far the best experience we have had with any staff at a hotel as an overall rating. I hope River rock resort gets to see this review.  Your staff are amazing!!!",2018-07-04T23:28:59Z,239

2053,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"Hotel was great. However we tried to get breakfast at the restaurant there behind the front desk. We were seated and waited for an hour without even getting our drinks. Horrible service.

A romance package at the hotel for our
13year anniversary it seems you cant do

Was going to surprise my wife couldn't just pay by debet card just stay at home
And do nothing",2017-06-24T05:12:32Z,239
2055,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"I'm giving 5 stars only for the following:
- The comfort of the bed.
- Pillow quality and quantity.
- Quietness of the room.
- Excellent view of the water.
- Size of the room. (I was in a King suite)
- The location of the hotel near airport and by the sky train.

Otherwise, the rest of the resort was just ho-hum and dated. There's a bit of moldy grout just outside the grout in my room (room 604) that could definitely be cleaned up with a bit of scrubbing and cleaner with bleach. Ick! They could provide more soap bars--I only got one. And overall, the place needs a nice remodel.

I liked my visit, and I'd stay here again for business travel because of my list above.",2019-12-04T15:09:11Z,239
2056,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"This was my first stay at River Rock Casino Resort Hotel.  I spent the weekend here with my wife and we stayed at the west wing.  Overall, I had a great stay at River Rock Casino Hotel Resort.  The room was a suite with a king size bed, couch, mini bar fridge, mini vault, desk, ironing board, iron, two TVs, a pretty big bathroom, hair dryer, extra pillows, and a Nespresso coffee machine.  The view was nice because every so often I would see a plane fly overhead.  Sound insulation was good too because it wasn't as noisy as expected.  It was a 5-8 mins walk to the parking garage and children cannot cut through from the casino.  Parents with kids must walk to the hotel on the building outskirt.  Hotel lobby was clean and the room was clean as well.  Bed was comfy and pillows were plenty.  Bed sheets and towels are clean and fresh.  There are two elevators on each wing.  The speed of the elevator was OK.  Check-in and check-out Staff was nice and housekeeping staff was nice too.  There are restaurants in the casino, Starbucks in the hotel lobby, giftshop, and a theatre.  Other shopping centres are close by and accessible via Canada Line train.  The location is very convenient and parking is free. 

So why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars since I was praising my stay at the hotel.  Any complaints?  Yes, I do but it wasn't addressed because I don't believe the staff could do anything about it.  The hotel WIFI was terrible...none of my devices could get a ""decent"" reception.  Signal strength on my devices were either 1 bar or none in the entire room.  I even went out onto the hallway from end to end and still couldn't get a decent signal strength.  I had to use my data on my phone to access my email and surf the web.  However, if you have a laptop you can connect the laptop via Ethernet cable on the desk.  My second complaint was parking on a weekend evening at River Rock Casino Hotel Resort was not good either.  I had to park on the top floor of the parking garage because there were a lot of cars.  There was also traffic congestion outside the resort due to Richmond Night Market.  Lastly the check-in staff didn't tell me about the amenities available for hotel guests...it's no big deal but it would be nice to know.  

Overall, I had a pleasant stay at River Rock Casino Resort.  Thank you for your hospitality!",2019-05-14T22:43:27Z,239
2057,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"I like this casino, they have a small but sweet variety of table games and slots. It's very clean and friendly. The food options are not that great but that's fine since this review is solely based on the casino itself. It's not far from downtown about a twenty minute drive and it's very easy to get cabs on your way out. Cramps and roulette table were both so much fun, and even though we didn't know the exact rules they were very friendly to us explaining. I came here twice during my stay very nice and more fun than Parq for gambling",2019-12-29T18:41:44Z,239
2058,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"I went here for my anniversary weekend and it was amazing! The train system was connected to the hotel so we could go everywhere without driving and most places were walking distance. If you stay here I recommend staying in the executive suites they are spacious and roomy. If you stay here you must check out their buffet, because it's delicious! The quality of the food is not your average Joe low quality buffet food. They have carved meats, sushi, many different kinds of breads, asian food, and a delicious dessert bar. I highly recommend going their before 5 pm if you are going for dinner, because the line builds up quickly! The best time to go is when the night market is open, because it is very close to the hotel. I will be back!",2017-01-09T19:22:33Z,239
2059,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"Ya Don't!
This place is well, well past his prime, worn out very tired. The building, the service, the people ....nothing inspiring. 
They upgraded our room to a magnificent view of the cement plant - Sure, that's a big upgrade over looking at a parking lot.
Situated in an industrial part of town there's nothing interesting around the resort except for every three minutes a fly-over by aircraft,  on the way to the airport.
Then the fun surprise when you check out, The  greedy are working to their true capacity...

Surprise! 
Destination marketing fee $$$

2060,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"I stay here often for work, but the last few times have been off-putting. There has been hair on my shower walls when I've checked in (twice), dirty bathroom countertops and a tub that won't drain. The staff can be either super friendly of extremely curt. This last visit, I was waiting to get on the elevator and when the door opened, the housekeeping woman was getting off when her mop handle fell forward and hit me on the head. Obviously not a huge deal, it's a mop handle, not a bat, but she didn't even acknowledge it even though she clearly saw it happen. If anything, she looked angry that I was in her way. 

Definitely not what it used to be, and definitely not my first recommendation.",2017-01-25T02:57:49Z,239

2062,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"Let's talk positives:

Clean
Great location if you intend to visit the night market 

Negatives:

First of all, the two women at check informed us that our room was not ready. It was past 4 pm and we had driven since 7 am to get here. I understand things come up but they couldn't give us an answer as to why or when our room would be ready. They were short with us like they couldn't be bothered. I informed them that if we did a late check out, we would have been charged. She looked up our reservation and in a condescending tone said ""oh one night. We can offer you late check out if you want."" No thanks since we have a long drive ahead of us tomorrow as well. 
Then as we were checking out the casino lobby, Terry at the check in to the casino was rude to us two occasions. He snapped at us because we had my two year old daughter next to us while we read the sign near the casino and said ""no minors!"" Yes we know that the age is 19 and older, we get that. Then when it was just my husband and I, he was rude again when we were trying to get through. 

We heard very good reviews about your establishment and were so excited to celebrate my mother's 67th birthday today and it has put a very big damper on our occasion.

I posted the above on their Facebook and they haven't replied so I am sure they don't care at all about customer service",2019-07-01T13:24:51Z,239
2063,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"We decided to go to River Rock for a birthday celebration. Overall, the quality was good in our experience. We walk in for the dinner buffet without reservation. We went there during sunset, the view out of the window was great. A waitress directs us to a table next to the window friendly. The buffet has a variety of different dishes, such as pasta, salad bar, hot dishes, sushi, roast meats, seafood, dessert and beverage else. Seafood was not bad, all food is presented cleanness. The square, sponge and puffy cotton candy for dessert was my favourite.",2019-03-17T21:18:18Z,239

A lady was following me as I was walking to different slots and made me really uncomfortable. 
The blackjack dealer was rude as they had a different version of blackjack than what were used to in the US.

The casino itself is really nice and I really appreciate that Canada doesn't let anyone smoke inside!",2018-06-05T17:49:59Z,239

On Tuesdays, Triple O's White Spot offers their Original Burgers with a sliced pickle for $3.67 including tax. I've generally been pleased with this burger giving it a 4/5. One occasion it was dry but injecting extra condiments was an easy fix.

You can also add an extra beef patty to your burger for an extra $1.50.",2017-04-12T01:53:57Z,239
2066,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"Why is it so difficult to get a bottle of water? I politely asked a staff lady at the bar station for a bottle of water at approximately 4:00 pm on February 17, 2018, ""Can I please have a bottle of water?"" and the lady gave me an impression like she was high on something. I asked again, ""Can I please have a bottle of water?"" and right away she gave me the impression that she was deaf by pointing to her ears. She tells me that, ""I can hear you and you don't have to repeat it"". I had to ask her a second time because she gave me no verbal or physical reply, so I had to ask her again.

How could someone like her work in the service industry with that kind of attitude?",2018-02-18T03:08:44Z,239
2067,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"Came in here on the way to walking to our car last night and being from Vegas I said hey why not stop in and drop a few Canadian dollars on the dice table.

The first thing I noticed upon walking up to the dice table is that there was no floor man standing over the chips at the table. It was just a stickman and a dealer to the right slowly handing out payouts.

I would never recommend coming back here to play dice because the odds are incredibly low for the come line bet. It was 3x odds. Which means the house edge stays pretty high. 

The action was pretty slow and you see droves of people that aren't really gambling just standing around tables and in the Isles cluttering up the place. 

It is however good for a restroom stop after you come out of the Night Market.",2018-07-22T15:38:00Z,239
2068,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"Alright, so let's rate this based on other casinos in general.

The signage is terrible. Find the hotel desk without asking someone, go for it!

Check-in for the hotel had a 40 minute wait and kids running around. Why are there so many kids at a casino?

The room smells like cheap cleaner and the bed (which they offer you can buy) may be only good for extra curricular activity and not so much for sleeping. Think circus bed! Great for the kids! (This explains the kids in the lobby!)

You want to gamble? Wait in line for an hour to get your encore card just to gamble. 

The food is mediocre at best and isn't changed out as often as it should be at the buffet. The wait at busy times is an hour to 2 hour wait.

The one good star comes from the calm lack of energy on the casino floor. It's so soothing you very well could fall asleep in the chair in front of the machine or table you are sitting at. They would do well to offer table massages for sure!

Want an unorganized unimportant feeling for the weekend? This is the hotel/casino for you! Included with a ""lion sleeps tonight"" assemble and clashing colors everywhere. 

Yikes! Who designed this place? China called and wants its B-stock furniture back!",2017-12-17T02:26:39Z,239
2069,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"The food here has seriously gone downhill!!!  It's ""Uncle Willy's"" quality with a 3x price tag. 

They used to have a decent selection of desserts. Now they have a candy jar and serve store bought cookies and desserts.  

The best part of their buffet used to be the crab legs which were super fresh, meaty and served chilled.  Now the crab is too salty and boiled because it's not fresh!  The legs are 50% smaller now.  They changed their crab supplier and are SCREWING customers!",2017-10-01T16:34:08Z,239

Of course, we had to visit, but it was so late that we did not actually play anything. The security guard checks id's for anyone that looks under the age of 19. 19 is the gambling age in Canada, which I thought was cool.

Need I mention how many times Rodney & Bj had to walk back and forth to the room to the car- misplaced wallet- walk- forgot car keys- walk- wife bugging to make sure he gets wallet that has IDs- walk- I'm not sure how many more times but he does have the wallet clip thing. Yay. The room is comfortable- clean- still I brought Clorox wipes (no visible residue after wiping room). Cure how Zach & Sammy says ""your room smells like clorox"". I like the room electrical - needs to have room key in card reader for the electric to work. Forgot the room door hangar things- special buttons for it. The coffee machine is cool.

I brought my corgi here and she loved it was very loved by the cleaning ladies and guests. 

The front desk is a hit or miss... the man who checked me in was not friendly and not helpful, however the man who checked us out was super friendly and loved our corgi! 

The bars were great! Very worth the money. Strong and tasty!! However, i dinged this place 1 star because of the food options in the casino are ehhh... i wouldn't have eaten there but it were the only ones open at 12 AM.

I was on the 3rd floor and needed to head back up to the 6th floor and was passed up 3+ times because the elevator was full. After waiting 5+ mins, I decided to head down to the 1st floor instead to ride back up from the bottom floor (unacceptable for a hotel that charges $300+ per night).

salad accompliments, cheeses, smoked fish.  Cold crab, shrimp and mussels are available on ice. Tonight I tried the hot crab legs and it was on the salty side. Carving prime rib station, chicken, ham and sushi assortment. Soup area with bread selections available and endless desserts! They also have coffee/tea, juices and soft drinks to go with the buffet.

2. The customer service didnt know if they held poker tournaments or not... so I said to myself, I guess Ill just play solitaire by myself in my room 

3. I have grey hair and they needed to check 2 pieces of id everytime i walked into the gambling area... paaaarrrrrranoid!

2080,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"I brought my family here for Labor Day weekend and I was expecting it to be a good time since my husband and I stayed here once before but a couple of years ago but staying at the resort was the worst idea we could've ever made. If you want to experience the worst customer service and expensive casino food then this is the place. I rented two suites and spent a good amount of money because I was hoping that my family would be able to get the full on Richmond experience. Checking in was easy, I signed the usually papers, got charged my huge bill and then was told our rooms weren't ready which was fine because we were about 15 mins early. No big deal. I was told that since I did all the paperwork all's I had to do was show my drivers license to pick up my keys. We parked the car walked back in about 30 mins later to get our keys and was told only one of our rooms were ready. Ticked off because I had a new baby and my parents who are 70 + didn't need to be walking around waiting. I take my family up to one of the rooms after the front desk lady, a total bitch, made me basically go through the check in process again because she didn't know how to find me in the system. Didn't apologize, was just a bitch. I asked her when my second room would be ready since it was well after 4 at this point and she said soon but I should call down before trying to get my keys. I called about 15 mins later and was told it was ready. When I came down, I happened to get the same bitch who told me it still wasn't ready and then she said I told you to call down, I said I did and she acted like I was lying. I asked to complain and speak to a manager and she told me I could write a note and she would hand it to them, I highly doubt she was an honest person and I am sure she would have just thrown it away. I told her the customer service was horrible and that they didn't do a good job at explaining where the parking was, the elevators were... you know, the basics... their JOB. 

After 5pm so we'll over an hour we finally get our rooms, after going up and down the damn building multiple times. After my blood was boiling I thought you know tomorrow let's try to make it a better one. I take my family down to redeem my ""free"" breakfast that I practically paid for with the expensive rates I was charged and then the lady told me we needed tickets!!! Are you kidding me?!?! We WEREN'T given OUR tickets.  So I walk downstairs hoping I would get the same witch gal I had to deal with the day before. I informed the guy that the horrible lady who checked me in didn't give me my breakfast tickets and once again I had to go all the way down to ask for them. He made it seem like he didn't understand wtf I was saying and I told him to give me my free breakfast tickets. After typing non sense he handed them over. My one suggestion for this dumb place is to learn what decent customer service is. How about you don't treat your guests like they're shit and do your fucking job. Needless to say, I will never come to this place ever again and I wouldn't suggest others, who are coming with families especially waste their money or time here. Wayyyy better places to stay at.

2083,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"It just seems to me that the buffet is really going downhill lately. It used to be about $28 and a lot better. It now is $33.50 for breakfast. The items seems to be more like Costco style deserts, salad that comes in a bulk bag where you can smell it's not rinsed off because it has that musky smell to it. Cheap pastas, rice, chow neon etc kind of reminded me like it's starting to head towards the Cracker Barrel style buffers with only 1/4 of the items. It seems as tho the River Rock has started charging more for the buffet now and cheapening and lessening the items as well as lowering the quality of food. 
I may check it out again to see if the dinner buffet is any better. It used to be somewhat decent but it seems there's not a whole lot of great buffets around. 
The Newlands Golf course is hands down the best for the value when it comes to buffets",2018-09-24T04:01:41Z,239

A lot of the dealers on the tables are asian.. and they'll only talk to you.. and be nice to you.. if you're an old chinese lady with a gambing addiction. and they speak chinese to each other, cause they don't want you in on their conversation! COME ONNNNNNN! Learn to speak some decent english, and give the other players a good time! We aren't here just to hand over our money.. atleast entertain us with small chitchat and pretend that you care, and pretend that you feel bad taking our hard earned pay. 

Don't even get me started with the old chinese lady PLAYERS.. who grumble in chinese to themselves.. because other ppl don't know how to play blackjack properly. (It ticks me off too..) But atleast you don't see me shooting laser beams out of my eyes to the player. Its called gambling for a reason. Don't like the human interactions?

As a local people, we may not stay at hotel but I would come here for show, dinner, gamble and etc.

2086,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"This was the second stay we have had here in less than a year. LOVE the beds. We were not here for the casino, but to eat and lay around on the last leg of our trip back to Oregon. We did not disappoint ourselves. Food was great, as usual. I was glad to see it is still really fresh choices and not the grease laden stuff you normally see at a buffet. 

The only complaint I had this time was our room was stuffy and we could not get the air down. I called the front desk to see if I had somehow gotten amnesia and could not figure how to work a thermostat. No, I had not, they control it on their end and she asked me what temperature I wanted it. i did not like that for some reason. I wanted to be as manic as I wanted to with the thermostat on my own. I give her a cool number of 18 Celsius, it was 24C at that time, and she said she'd do what she could. Then I asked for more coffee pods and she said it was $5 a pod. No kidding. I don't think I feel like coffee anymore. 

About two hours later we get a doorbell, because yeah there is a doorbell in this place for each room, and we find the maintenance guy there telling us we will not be going down to 18C but he could take us to 19C. Really. Okay. He proceeded to vacuum out the filter and left. It was never really cool in the room and it never went past 21C. I was so comfortable in the bed, I didn't care as much, as say if I were in a spring in my back kinda bed.. then we'd talk major star deduct right there.",2012-08-23T06:07:17Z,239
2087,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"My first time visiting this place and I was impressed.  From the outside, it didn't look big, but it was quite huge inside.  I am more of a slot player and had fun trying to play the different machines. They have slots from Wonder Woman to Friends and retro ones. Definitely a fun experience to share with friends!",2017-03-27T03:51:28Z,239

2089,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"We really enjoyed our stay at the river rock. Steps to skytrain, many restaurants and a big casino. We arrived to Vancouver earlier than expected and they accommodated us by allowing us to check in early.",2019-12-12T00:03:16Z,239
2090,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"I'm going to rate this for what this is, and what we have comparable to this, first off folks, this is an f'ing casino, don't downgrade it by saying you lost money, things are expensive, we came here to eat and the food is crap, first off, what is a casino, it's a place to risk it all to win money, the chance, the dream, it's all happening in your head prior to you even stepping through those doors! Don't compare this to Vegas, cause if you do, you may as well give it a 1 star, really, think about it, like your going to rate an airport, and drop the rating down cause their is a Burger King in there.... really, I don't see it?

First and foremost, this is a place to play with your money, many games, from the one arm bandits that have become more like arcade video machines, there is a ton of them there. There is a seperate section (that used to be upstairs, but now across the street) for you black glass wearing poker players, then you get the big sections of baccarat tables (mostly filled with Chinese) and also two seperate side rooms for higher betting limits, more tables or roulette, black jack, pai gow poker, and what other normal casino game you can think of, it's here. I don't know if much of you remember the casino that used to be on Bridgeport and No. 3 Road, this is a huge upgrade, sure it's no Vegas, but most people are there to win money, this could be in a back of an alley, and if your winning do you really care... shoot, some of you reviewers would go all out fire blazing 5-star if you came out on top!

So, what if your not into gambling, what then, what is there to do here you ask? They have a hotel (pretty new, pretty nice), tv's everywhere, and if there is a Canucks game on, they are showing it, wherever your gambling or eating, they have a live theatre and on any given night you have some 'has-been' that is playing here, maybe Boyz-2-Men, Russell Peters, Air Supply, some Chinese singer concert, just to name a few I've seen listed over the years, they have a buffet with a different menu night every night, they have a high end restaurant upstairs, and a lounge restaurant below, across the street they have a Chinese seafood restaurant, they have a big multi-level parking lot, and also they have a Skytrain station outside so it's easy (but not advised if you have some sort of gambling problem) to come here. Taxi's are easy to flag down, in the summers the Richmond Night Market is next door, there's a live band and stage at the bar, there's an Asian style food court for you real late nighter's, or one's who need a quick eat to hit the tables fast.

Vegas this is not, your going to need a whole bunch more casinos in one area to make even a mini Reno, but for a casino it's got enough variety of food and entertainment in here. If your really coming here for anything else than gambling, don't complain, know it was your choice to come, what really is the attraction is the gambling first and foremost. I mean, you don't rate the Keg based on their salad, why would you rate a casino just solely based on it's food??? Exactly.... case closed.",2013-09-11T22:04:58Z,239
2091,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"My mom and I stopped here for the night while heading west for her big cross-country move and we had a blast. Our sixth-floor suite had huge windows and we were treated to a complimentary upgrade to a marina-view room. For an extra $25 pet fee, we were able to give our cat the run of the room. Although the suite lacked a bathtub, the shower was luxurious and relaxing enough to make up for it. 

A boardwalk circles the backside of the casino, and it was fun to check out the boats moored at the docks and to watch the wildlife in the small wetland area beside the small marina. A pair of geese waddled along with four playful chicks in tow, and a heron stood among the reeds. 

We spent a few hours in the casino downstairs, where there is a great selection of penny and two-cent machines to keep those who aren't into risking the big bucks busy. Our only complaint was the price of drinks at the casino bar. 

River Rock's buffet maybe didn't live up to its big price tag, but I really enjoyed the variety of vegetarian friendly options available, including gluten. The range of desserts was impressive; my mom and I gluttonously sampled about 8 different dessert items as well as some fresh fruit. Aside from the gelatinous creme caramel, all were hits, especially the chocolate cherry pavolva and strawberry almond torte. Included in the price of our room was a trip to the breakfast buffet, which had a bit less to offer than the dinner. I wound up having a fairly light meal - a croissant, a bowl of fruit and some smoked salmon. Our server at breakfast was really friendly and attentive, unlike the overworked dinner servers. 

It might not live up to Las Vegas, but this is Canada. The 24-hour River Rock Casino showed my mom and I a wonderful time and I'd definitely recommend it.",2010-04-28T02:15:10Z,239
2092,River Rock Casino Resort,3.2,"A non smoking casino...Yeea ya! Located close to the airport but not that noisy but I did had earplugs.

Average fitness center and nice pool. Overall a nice stay.",2013-09-06T09:36:39Z,239
2093,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"Our group spent a couple nights here after a cruise in Alaska and was pleasantly surprised with the accommodations.  

I had a standard room with a beautiful view of Vancouver and one of my friends splurged for a suite. Both rooms were equally nice, but I would have loved to have a living room and extra space. 

The hotel staff was spot on, attentive, and extremely friendly.  They attended to our needs and made sure we had a fabulous stay. 

We tried the Italian restaurant attached to, but not affiliated with, the hotel. I was not impressed with the food or the service. If it's your only option, then do what you have to do, but there lots of Asian restaurants in the area within walking distance that are so much better.

Enjoyed our stay and would stay again. That's probably the highest recommendation anyone could give for a hotel.",2023-11-11T16:59:54Z,54
2094,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"First time at this location, second time with the chain. Stayed for three night as I was working in the city. The room was nice. Functional, not complicated, and had more than enough options for most people. The kitchen is fabulous to have available for longer stays. And that large refrigerator is wonderful.

The WiFi is good, by the way. Having the desk with a window view was a nice part for this corner unit. The patio is roomy as it is a corner location, has a wide view of the side without other buildings in the way from my angle. 

The layout of the hotel is odd. Drop offs and registration are on floor 1, lounge/breakfast area is on 5, main entrance is on 3 from the street corner which I didn't find until second day when walking from the outside.

The bed was comfortable and plenty rooms. I usually like firmer pillows but there were so many that it was not hard to make due.

Added location bonus, it's near my work. So a short commute to the office. I know this is my hotel of choice on these business trips.",2022-10-23T20:55:19Z,54
2095,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"I stayed at the Element Vancouver Metrotown for 6 nights for a work event. The first night there I called service to clean the shower as the shower floor was dirty. I sent a message via the app and they acknowledged and serviced the room almost immediately. The entire staff was great, greeted me by name every interaction and down right great at their jobs. Happy even. I was in and out the hotel often and would run into staff laughing with one another. I thought that was an awesome sight to see. Now room had everything I needed and a great view. My only complaint were the pillows. The pillows were so flat. I doubled up on the pillows in my case to make a standard pillow. My neck was killing me the first night. I would recommend bringing or purchasing your own if possible. There's a mall within walking distance. Oh, my room was with equipped with a full kitchen and a grocery store was right outside the hotel. Good in the area wasn't the greatest but hotel breakfast was decent most mornings. I would recommend this hotel, just remember to bring your own pillows. I can't stress this enough lol",2023-04-01T08:34:24Z,54
2096,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"We always travel with our 6 year old and pup so traditional hotels are difficult which is why Element stood out for us. The kitchen definitely came in handy but the free breakfast was unexpected and we were so grateful! We thoroughly enjoyed the pool as well. The on-site staff, front desk and cleaning team were great. Super friendly.  The location of the hotel was great. 15 minutes to everywhere with a grocery store across the street. This was our first time to Vancouver and we will be back! Thank you Element!",2023-07-24T15:18:13Z,54
2097,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"I didn't enjoy my stay here and won't ever go back or recommend it. If you are a Marriott Platinum or Elite member, they couldn't care less, especially if you are using points to pay for the room. They will give you the crappiest room they have available. They will nickle-and-dime you on stupid stuff that's normally free for Marriott members. There is none of the normal Platinum perks or niceties that typically come with membership. 

The manager wasn't professional and seemed to really not care at all. One of the staff arranged for a room change for me so I could have a view on my last night there (instead of looking directly into an office building) but the manager came in at the last minute and canceled it so he could save it for later. This was after I wasted hours waiting for it to be cleaned. (I think the rooms with the 2 queen beds are the ones with the views, so ask for that.) Also, the walls are thin so I could hear the rooms next to me and lots of doors slamming, plus the bed was too soft so after a few days it became uncomfortable.

The parking was HORRIBLE. Tiny parking spaces and not enough of them for all the guests. I was always worried about my new car being dinged and always wondered if I would get a spot. Definitely not worth having to pay for such a bad parking situation. 

The upside is the location is within walking distance to the sky train to go into the city and the hotel itself is newer so it's clean. I also enjoyed the breakfast. It was a small area and not tons to choose from but the main dish was different each day I was there. The kitchen staff was very nice.",2022-10-02T20:21:58Z,54
2098,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,Hotel gave me accessible room that I did not book. Heavy electric accessible bathroom door did not work so I had to move it manually to open and close. Worse this door would open and close randomly making lots of noise at night so couldn't sleep well. Room also smelled like cigarette smoke and had sewer flies. I asked for partial refund for all this and hotel refused but said they'd give Marriott points worth over $60. Looked up points value and they lied - points they gave were worth $35. Recommend you stay at another hotel.,2023-09-03T21:57:45Z,54
2099,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"A mini-family reunion was held in the first week of July (yay, Canada day).     My grandfather wanted to see his brother in Burnaby.  Our extended family was more the gracious in offering a spot to stay at their place.  I kindly declined the offer since I was planning to go 'rage' at night and hang out with my other friends who were up from the SF for the week.  

The one bedroom was contemporary and up to date with white cabinets, stainless steel appliances and a fairly ample patio overlooking Central Park.  Location wise, it was a 10 minute walk to Metrotown.  From Metrotown, we were able to take the SkyTrain all over the Vancouver vicinity.  Here's a couple of the things I did during the trip:

*Dinner @ SURA Korean BBQ
*SkyTrain over to River Rock Casino Resort in Richmond
*Rented a bike and looped around Stanley Park & downtown
*Cactus Club Cafe in Yaletown
*Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge (it was free, thought it was not the Capilano it was amazing to see my 90 yo grandfather and his brother walk across)
*Cleveland Dam
*Dim Sum with the fam at Western Lake Chinese Seafood 
*Pay respects at Forest Lawn Memorial Park
*Hanging out friends at the downtown lounges (I remember a trip in my early twenties raging at Gastown, dancing at the Purple Onion YAASSS!!!)
*Richmond Night Market (wooah!!!  this spot puts all those night market promoters in California to shame)

A fun time always in Vancouver to visit the extended fam and chill with friends enjoying that Vancouver life and having comfortable accommodations and accessibility at the Element for this memorable trip.",2019-11-11T22:28:33Z,54
2100,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"Loved this place ! Great location ( close to Metrotown ) 
Very bright, clean,roomy & modern. 

It's set up for extended stay as it has a kitchenette to cook in. The appliances are new and stainless steel. 

It also has a sitting area, and a nice bathroom with rain shower head. 

They have a pool and a fitness center. They also have a free breakfast. It has fresh apple, orange and cranberry juices , pastries, oatmeal, toast, hash browns, sausage, eggs, granola, dried cranberries, coffee and tea. 

They have a rather large, bright clean room to eat in as well as the patio. It's always rather busy. 

I really liked it here, I have stayed here 3-4 times and would defiantly stay here again.",2018-12-11T16:35:01Z,54
2101,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"The pros: new and modern, Trattoria is in the same building and it's very centrally located near Metrotown. 
The cons: there is no valet service, no bellman to help with suitcases and the pool is shared with the residents in the building. 

We came here for a girl's night when we couldn't decide on a restaurant. We wanted air conditioning, a pool and room service. 
Check in was ok, staff was nice enough, the A/C was decent but when we went to the pool, there were two families with about 6 or 7 kids who were screaming and using water guns. It wasn't exactly the relaxing swim we'd hoped for. I assume they are residents of the building as they were very familiar with the facilities but they could have been hotel guests. We'll never know. Towels weren't stocked in the linen room so we had to call the front desk to bring some. 
When we ordered room service from Trattoria, we found out we had to go get the food and bring it back the room. Not a huge deal, but not room service either. 
The hotel rooms seem to cater to longer business stays as they have microwaves, and longer stay items in the kitchen. 
Overall, this isn't a frills hotel.",2018-08-01T05:51:46Z,54
2102,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"New hotel in Metrotown. Had a seminar here. Definitely a good venue. Has parking but you do have to pay. If you are trying to enter the parking lot be sure you are heading north or else you will have to do a detour to get to it. The hotel is connected to the residential building which is somewhat awkward. So food is tasty here. Had breakfast included with the seminar and everything made fresh on the spot. I like it. Have to say the sausages here are very good. 

Elevator is somewhat a bad design. So when I was waiting for the elevator, I have no clue which one has arrived. I couldn't see the door open nor was there any lights other then the button lights going off. Just a bad design. Other than that, this is a nice hotel",2018-04-14T04:23:00Z,54
2103,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"This hotel is nestled in the middle of metrotown aka Chinatown.  It is right across the street from the Hilton but it's connected to the better stores and restaurants like Tratorria and the shipping mall.

What I like about this hotel is that it's connected to the shopping mall.  It's also really clean and up to date.  I was put up on the 9th floor with a view of the businesses on the street side below.  In the room, it had a full service kitchen with stove top oven, fridge, microwave and dishwasher.  I mean I really didn't need it but it was a nice perk.  I also liked the fact that the stand in shower was huge with both a rain shower and shower handle included.  The shower stall also had liquid body wash and shampoo dispensers on the wall.  Pretty nice touch and reminded me of my fitness center showers.

Nice touches to a place away from home make a huge difference!  Lastly, the staff here is generous and helpful.  Don't hesitate to ask them anything as they are always willing to help out.

Definitely would stay at this hotel everytime I visit.",2018-01-08T08:01:10Z,54
2104,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"Great place to stay, especially for a relatively extended stay. 

Biggest standout here is the staff. Everyone I encountered was super friendly, helpful, and accomodating. Whether it was getting an extra shaving razor, or moving rooms halfway through my stay (they sent someone up with a luggage cart to help us move everything!), the staff were on point. 

Amenities are great. Well equipped kitchenette with clean, modern appliances: a large fridge, stovetop, sink, utensils, dishes, cups, etc. Bathrooms are well appointed (loved the rain showerhead). Beds are comfy. 

Fitness center is a bit modest but gets the job done. Dumbbells go up to 60 lbs each IIRC, which isn't bad for a hotel gym. Included breakfast in the mornings and complimentary reception during weekday evenings (M-Th) are some nice perks. 

Downside is that parking is a relatively pricy $16(?)/day, which stacks up if you're staying for more than just a few days. But why drive when SkyTrain and the buses are so convenient, right? 

Close to lots of shopping- there's a plaza with a BC Liquors and a Shopper's Drug Mart across the street. Crystal Mall is also across the street the other direction if that's more your speed. Finally, Metrotown is a short ~3 minute walk.",2019-01-15T13:36:04Z,54

2107,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"We (senior couple) did a one-night stay at Element recently - it's the still very ""shiny & new"" Westin hotel located on Kingsway, just across from Crystal Mall, Metrotown.  I had indicated an early-arrival time (noon) when I booked, and we arrived at the check-in counter a few minutes before the mark.  The friendly staff person at the desk kidded me about being too early, but he'd see what he could do.  I enjoyed his approach, and the whole check-in thing was a breeze and pleasant experience!  I had booked a standard room, with king bed, and mini-kitchenette -- he wanted to upgrade us, without additional charge, to a junior suite, with king bed, and full kitchenette - we accepted.  

We had checked in to stay three nights, but later that afternoon, realized there was a personal problem on the home-front, and we would have to cancel the additional two nights.  I brought this to the attention of the desk staff as soon as possible, and thank them for being so understanding and accommodating.  So unfortunately, we did not get up to as much as we had hoped, either 'within' the hotel (and trying the various amenities), or 'outside' in the neighbourhood (and seeing/experiencing more than we did).

Our room was great - up on the 16'th floor - with commanding views to the south (Metrotown area stuff in the foreground, the Fraser River and planes descending to YVR in the distance).  And it was so quiet!!  Wow, those windows must be 'tripled' glazed!!  The room itself, was a touch 'stark and cool' in decorations, but everything was there, neatly-arranged, and spotlessly-clean.  I really liked the rather large executive desk - with its glass top, three drawers, neat lamp, and AC charge module (found connecting to their WiFi a slow, and touch awkward procedure, but the service was good, once accomplished).  And we both thought the bed was 'the' most comfortable we've slept on anywhere!!  We used the coffee maker for some early-am coffee (a small, and cool, 'one-large-mug-at-a-time' rig), and the fridge (to store drink stuff for our afternoon & evening 'happy-hours'!). 

A continental 'plus' breakfast was included with the room charge.  The setup and dining area is at one end of the 5'th floor - the floor dedicated to all the amenities -- computer/printer workstation, sitting areas, small meeting rooms, fitness room, swimming pool, whirlpool, and outside deck.  The breakfast had a rather nice selection of juices, coffees & teas, fresh fruits, yogourts, buns/bagels/scones/breads, and two 'hot' dishes (small croissant sandwiches).  A nice way to start one's day.

We enjoyed our short stay at Element.  It's a cool place, and sure handy to all the sights & sounds in Burnaby's Metrotown.",2016-03-22T19:22:53Z,54
2108,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"I recently attended a political rally here (yeah! Got to see and hear Justin Trudeau, and was only about 5 feet away from him, in an intimate conference room where the rally was held), so this review is NOT for the hotel rooms or amenities per se, but more so for the conference room and basic hotel common area accommodations. (Note: earlier in the year I stayed at an Element hotel in Redmond, WA and it was lovely. Check out my review for that hotel. Overall, I'm quite impressed by this chain). 

I gave myself lots of time to get here, as I'm not that familiar with the area. I drove, despite this hotel being very accessible via Skytrain. The parking garage is refreshingly easy to access and navigate, with good signage and clear lanes up and down between levels. I was worried how much parking in the parkade here would cost but, surprisingly, I paid only $6 for 12 or 24 hours (I wasn't sure how long I'd be here. I think it cost $4 for 2 hours, perhaps 4, and so the $6 charge was only $2 more for a TON more time. I didn't want to worry about time constraints). I thought the pricing reasonable; they easily could've gauged us for more.

Since I was quite early, I waited in the hotel lobby for a while. I had talked to the head of hotel security to see if that was okay. He was very friendly and helpful. (Note: there was a TON of security presence there, as one could imagine). The lobby was small but there were various separate seating nooks and areas, some with coffee tables with fab photo-heavy coffee table books to peruse, and there was a water stand to get cold drinking water, and daily newspapers. I also liked how there were table-mounted outlets on the tables to charge your phones. Nice touch. 

The conference room we were ushered into was upstairs, up an escalator, up a narrow staircase, down a narrow hallway. It was small but functional. I'm sure there are larger meeting rooms in this hotel, too. (One issue that the people around me commented on was the lack of air circulation. We were all standing, in close proximity, for nearly two hours, and it was getting hot in the room! Many of us were using the cardboard banners we were given as fans, fanning the air onto ourselves. A fan in the room would've been nice). 

There was one issue that many of us in attendance were not thrilled with, which is the reason I'm docking my review one star: in contrast to the large bank of elevators that whisk folks up to their hotel rooms, there are only TWO elevators that bring people down to their cars in the parking garage. Two. And they aren't that large, either. Imagine a large event where lots of people drive to. Older people. People in wheelchairs. People with walkers. All waiting in a tiny hallway for one of two elevators to arrive, to get them to their parked cars in the parkade below. And not only are there only two elevators but they are SLOW. There were no signs nearby pointing to any stairway to access the lower parking garage areas, so those of us who could walk stairs didn't know where to go. We all waited there a crazy long time to get to our cars. I was thankful I opted for the 24 hour parking limit when I pre-paid, as the wait felt like an eternity, and everyone there was grumbling. (I finally got on a packed elevator after a 15-minute wait. Others waited longer. Crazy!).",2019-10-13T06:42:35Z,54
2109,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"Nice boutique condo-style hotel in the Metropolis area.

Parking is available in the underground lot for guests.  At night, there are also plenty of spots along the street for visitors.

If it weren't for the signs outside, the place really does look like a condo tower.  The unit my friends stayed in had a bedroom, kitchen area, and even a covered balcony.  As this tower is new, everything feels like a brand new condo.  The view from the balcony is quite nice, as this is the tallest building in the vicinity.",2016-04-15T10:05:33Z,54

2113,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"We stayed here for a few nights on our recent trip to Vancouver.  The hotel is located in Metro Town which is about a 20min drive from downtown, Richmond, and UBC.  If you plan to stay at this hotel a car would come in handy for sure- note that parking is a reasonable $12 per day.  One slight annoyance is the crowded elevators.  You'll have to wait several minutes during peak morning hours. 

Our room up on the 17th floor had commanding views of the town below.  We had a standard room which didn't have the full kitchen others mentioned... but we did have a fridge and microwave.   Everything is clean and simple.  I personally love the wood floors as carpets in hotels tend to get dirty.  Breakfast is included and served on the 5th floor lounge.  It is the continental variety but with some hot egg wraps/sandwich option also available.  The fitness room is also on the 5th floor and pretty basic- just a few machines and dumbbells. 

There are a few shopping malls, a supermarket, drug store, and a gazillion restaurants all within walking distance.  There is also an amazing food court in the mall across the street.  Don't miss it. If you like Asian food you'll be a happy camper.",2016-07-03T20:20:21Z,54
2114,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"Great north views from their huge balconies.  

Not a big fan of their suites, a bit tight as per pics.  Think that's what they call kitchenette though with the latest furnishings.  

This is our preferred choice for our clients who fly in, central to everything.  

The lobby is a bit confusing, below ground level.  Guess you can see the above open floor would be the mezzanine.  Good security, need a fob.  

One thing, Internet is terrible at lobby, esp under the stairs where there is comfy wall seating.  Very spacious drop off for check in.  

At least the pay meter machines work.  Parking lot bright & accessible. 

For Burnaby, this is considered DT so for the tourists/guests, you're in a safe area.  Of course, it's a Westin.  

Expensive during some times of the year, I recall $300/nite back in July.  

The breakfast floor is awesome, great patio and a few good meeting lounges.  Highly recommend for business.",2016-01-03T21:20:00Z,54
2115,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"What a new beautiful hotel in the heart of Burnaby! My husband and I recently stayed here over the weekend for our one year wedding anniversary. Everything about our stay was wonderful from the amazing staff, outstanding room quality and different amenities. Although the location is a not very close to downtown Vancouver, it is still close to other shopping centers and restaurants. 

PROS:

Service: 

From beginning to end (booking to check out) everything ran very smoothly. Ajit (I think that was his name) checked us in and he was extremely friendly and helpful. 

Ambiance/Rooms: 

The lobby is absolutely beautiful, spacious, contemporary and very modern. There are coffee/tea/water provided in lobby lounge areas by the stairs and elevators. There is also a little convenience area stocked with the basic necessities (drinks, snacks and some microwavable items). 

My room was also extremely nice, VERY CLEAN, well appointed and eco-friendly. We had a standard room with a king size bed and a city view. The room size was pretty average but it was very clean, came with a comfortable bed and a full kitchenette (microwave, fridge, sink, stove, cookware and dinnerware).  

The bathroom was a decent size and decently stocked (towels, soap, lotion, etc.) The toilet had a half flush/full flush system to conserve water. The body wash, shampoo and conditioner were in a dispenser on the shower wall. The shower had an overhead rain shower, not typical in every hotel. 

Amenities:

Free Wifi in all the rooms! 

All of the amenities are located in the 5th floor. The common indoor pool area and spa tub were smaller than average, but nicely presented. The fitness center was also a bit smaller but at least it's present. 

Free breakfast! I was actually very impressed with the breakfast choices. This is not your typical continental breakfast with the basic bagels and muffins but there are many warm items as well. Not to mention that there were also healthy options available! From my experiences there were juice, coffee, milk, yogurt, oatmeal, cereals, toast, muffins, bagels and the warm items included omelets, french toasts and a vegetarian wrap. The common area had an outside patio and many different lounge spaces. 

CONS:

Parking: $11/day. Parking garage with plenty of spaces available.",2015-08-25T06:50:24Z,54
2116,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"I've booked this hotel for a few nights. Everything is super clean and modern. I love that they have hardwood floors in the room. They have a kitchenette that is fully stocked with dishes, pots, etc. if you wish to cook your own meals. I have a view overlooking the central park. The bathroom is gorgeous and the lighting is perfection. Some of the drawers stuck and I pinched my finger on one. User error. Although, had the drawer been able to glide smoothly, it could've been avoided. Some oiling should fix it straight away. 

There are nice amenities: indoor pool and hot tub as well as a sauna. There is a laundry room and fitness center. The lounge is very large and whenever I'm in there it's very quiet. I've only ran into one lady using the computers in the business area and one man who smoked cigars on the terrace outdoors. I don't think he was supposed to smoke there as there is a separate area for smoking across the way, right outside of the pool area. Breakfast is served in the lounge. There's a nice variety available.

My only issue is that it's not super pet friendly. They allow pets and they gave my dog a bag of treats, but there is no pet area. The nearest strip of grass is just outside of the parkade and there is a sign that says to keep dogs off. There really isn't any grassy area to take pets to relieve themselves other than the park that is quite a walk. There is a strip of grass near the smoking area of the hotel, but I was told it's not to be used and I'm not allowed to take my dog out as other guests have allergies. 

I would stay here again, but work needs done on improving pet accessibility.",2016-06-23T21:22:23Z,54
2117,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"I was so excited to stay at this hotel for a weekend getaway for Valentines Day and the hotel was BEAUTIFUL! I booked the King Suite with the kitchenette and the balcony. My favorite hotel that I've ever stayed at. The kitchenette is so useful! The king bed suite was clean and the balcony had such a beautiful view. I cooked the dinner at our suite. There is pots, pans, strainers, and utensils. Fully equipped. And there is Crystal Mall and Metrotown right across from the hotel so ingredients are easy access from the hotel to stock your fridge. The suite was a little cramped, it was a really tight space.

Best part of this hotel: FREE BREAKFAST. I love breakfast, it's my favorite meal of the day. best breakfast bar that I've had at a hotel and it was complimentary. So delicious! 

Parking is $11, wish it was free but it wasn't. 
Whenever I called the front desk for something, they always seemed really annoyed but when you actually go up to the front desk, they're super nice and helpful. 


Very comfortable and very relaxing. I will come back when I get another chance. Loved this place!",2016-02-15T06:46:55Z,54
2118,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"If I could, I would rate Element Vancouver Metrotown as 3 1/2 stars. Although the name says ""Vancouver"", this is located in Burnaby, next to Metrotown and Crystal Mall. Everything is brand new and clean, which is always a plus. Even though it isn't in Vancouver, the Skytrain station is pretty close by, and you have a lot of food options around the hotel.

We were staying in the area for three nights, so we wanted a suite with a kitchen. As others have said, the suites are pretty small, but it has everything that you would need. We had a decent view to the NW, and could see the mountains from our 8th floor corner unit. Although we didn't end up cooking in the room, we did take advantage of the full-sized fridge and microwave to reheat our takeout food. The parking is reasonable as well @ 11 CAD per day.

If I had to choose, I would probably pick Element over the Hilton across the street. It is a little more expensive, but it is newer, has a kitchen in the room, and is much easier to park.

Overall, I would stay at Element again if I was in this part of town again.",2016-02-15T06:05:36Z,54
2119,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"Went to Vancouver for wedding this month. Great place to stay, hotel about 1 yr old and has shopping and grocery across the street. Free breakfast and also free relax hour in afternoon which had light appetizers. Secured building needing room cards to use elevators. Self parking $11 per day which is very reasonable compared to hotels downtown Vancouver.
Studio like room with kitchenette and all utensils included along with bowls, plates, pots and pans. Tea bags and coffee in room. Made myself a cup of hot tea nightly. Separate living room space. Loved it! Great when family came to room for visit and meeting up prior to dinner. Felt like I was in my own apartment. Bed was comfortable, slept very well has a safe inside room, iron, hair dryer and organic body wash and shampoo. Definitely would stay here again!",2016-06-17T00:47:45Z,54
2120,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"This is my second time staying here and I love it. My one and only complaint is they don't have a tub. Their toiletries are all organic and natural. I enjoy their free breakfast; they include a lot of healthy options along with your standard breakfast. Their breakfast seating is wonderful. It's set up with tables and chairs and another side with tables and televisions (living room style). This is perfect for my little one, because she doesn't do well sitting in a high chair. If you decline housekeeping, they take off $5 from your bill. There are convenient restaurants on the first floor (Italian and 2 Chinese restaurants). There is also a market across the street. This hotel is probably 20 minutes from downtown. Overall, great place to stay while in Vancouver.",2017-02-08T16:20:42Z,54
2121,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"Absolutely loved our stay at Element by Westin.  When you first arrive, you'll notice that the hotel looks like a high rise apartment from the outside.

Parking entrance is off of Willingdon Ave and the hotel parking is to the right upon entering.  There are parking spaces for electric (clean air) vehicles and small cars but guests seem to ignore it and park their large SUV's in these spots.  Unfortunately, parking isn't free as it costs $15 CAD per night to park there.  Wi-Fi is free but if you want faster speeds, you have the option to pay more.  I was able to stream videos without a problem using the complimentary Wi-Fi so I recommend against paying extra for the faster speeds.

If I could describe this hotel in one word, I'd describe it as ""clean.""  You'll see that everything at this hotel is very well maintained.  Upon entering the room, I was pleasantly shocked how clean and new the room looked.  The room has a flat screen TV, a modern refrigerator, a small dish washer, range, etc.  The rooms are perfectly designed with amenities for extended-stay, if you can afford the price.

Amenities include the use of a gym, pool, jacuzzi, sauna, business center and free breakfast from 7 am-10 am.  The breakfast room is large with computers for use and two TV's with at least one hooked up to video games.  Breakfast items include oatmeal, hard boiled egg, scrambled eggs, small potato wedges, sausage, fruits (cut up and ready to eat), bagel, toast, muffin, apple, orange, banana, orange juice, cranberry juice, and coffee.  The gym is small but you get a nice view and free disposable headphones for use while working out.  All the amenities for the hotel guests are located on the 5th floor.  You'll need your hotel key to access the elevator every time you use it and keep in mind that you cannot use the stairs to access the 5th floor because the hotel staff keeps the door locked at all times.

The location of this hotel is PERFECT if you want to avoid the madness of downtown Vancouver.  It's a short drive to the Capilano Suspension Bridge, to downtown Vancouver, airport, etc.  There is a Save-On-Foods directly across the street and Crystal Mall (aka you're not in Canada anymore) across the other street.

Overall, absolutely loved our stay.  Eveyone here is very friendly, courteous, and will make you feel welcome.  This hotel is extremely clean and staying here will make you feel like you're the first guest ever to stay inside the rooms.  Would definitely stay here again.  My only complaint was that after checking in, someone from management just walked into our room without knowing that we had checked in already.  It startled everyone involved and he should have known that we had already checked into the room.",2017-08-14T16:29:48Z,54
2122,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"If you can check into a new hotel, it's a good bet that the stay will be comfortable. If you check into an Element hotel that is new in Burnaby and get a high floor, you will definitely enjoy the view and your stay.
After spending the previous night in the outskirts of Vancouver, it was nice to get into a more city vibe. Burnaby may be the burbs but Aldergrove is another time zone!
The room was well designed and appointed. Neutral colours with earth tones and greens were very pleasing.
The full kitchen on one wall with closets and storage was quite unexpected. The bathroom was clean and modern. The bedroom was well sized and comfortable with a king sized bed. They actually had high-def TV so we enjoyed the Jays and the Olympics.
When not watching TV, the high floor gave us a panoramic view of the burb, Van City and even the mountains.
They advertise this as a long term stay hotel and it definitely can be a home away from home.
As many of the signs in hotel stated, stay at Element, save some cash and spend it on yourself. If you need to commute, the rail station is nearby - further savings on downtown parking.
Highly recommend the Element!",2016-08-23T03:52:54Z,54
2123,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"This place was a great choice for a quick stop passing through the Vancouver area. Parking was easy and only $11 CAD and I felt as though my belongings were safe in the car. I booked via Amazon about 2 hours before arrival and arrived around 12:30am. The front desk was very welcoming and got us checked in very quickly. The hotel is very clean and has a great modern feel to it-- lots of crisp lines and white decor. 

I stayed in a king room with a kitchenette and it was great size. Everything was clean and very comfortable! The shower products offered were also very nice and smelled great! 

There's a pretty small gym, but it's got great lighting and has very new machines! Definitely does the job. There's a great lounge area and a nice breakfast offered with the typical muffins, fruit, toast, and veggie or sausage breakfast sandwiches offered. 

Overall, great accommodations and only took us about 20 minutes to drive into downtown Vancouver the next morning!",2016-08-06T18:07:54Z,54
2124,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"This is our 3rd time staying at this hotel.  It is awesome.  The staff is welcoming and nice, the patio on the 5th floor is amazing and has a huge grill and gathering space for a group of people to hang out and socialize.  The rooms are also awesome with basically a full kitchen and a wonderful bed.  The pull out sofas are even comfortable.  Great coffee and a nice substantial breakfast in the morning.  Parking is only $12, but after taxes is about $17.  The higher level rooms are nice because of the view and the corner 1 bedroom suite rooms vary in size so if you want one with the most space, you should ask for one of those.  The decor is modern and fresh and the hotel is definitely secure!  You need your key card to get access to the floors, which can be a little annoying, but also keeps the guests safe.  Tons of restaurant and grocery store options within walking distance.",2018-06-05T01:53:45Z,54
2125,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"It has been my second time staying at an Element Hotel of the Starwood brand yesterday and I was truly shocked by the uncomfortable and unpractical room design at this property.

Right at arrival I felt the entire design and functionality of the hotel is incoherent and doesn't make you feel comfortable in the slightest. To reach the front desk you have to take stairs into the basement, then an elevator up to the room, a common area where they also serve breakfast is on level five.

The room itself had the charm of an IKEA show kitchen. At the actual store!

Element rooms (this was classified as a studio) have a kitchen/kitchenette which at the Vancouver property includes a large fridge and freezer as well as a dish washer. This kitchenette was 2 meters distance from the bed with the fridge making sounds like an aircraft taking off. I finally shut it down at 3am.

There was a turntable TV in the middle of the room and between Microwave & this TV they squeezed a work desk. The only way to get fresh air is to open one small window. The bathroom has no tub (none of them do - I asked!) and instead a large shower with pump bottles attached to the wall, a personal pet peeve of mine. The entire room had a cheap hardwood floor, not even a rug somewhere which gave the room an additional industrial feel.

According to the staff and random rate searches the hotel commands rates north of 250-300$ during weekdays. Incredible as I wouldn't even spend 100$ there and certainly won't return to this property.",2016-08-23T02:04:05Z,54

Free breakfast was nice too and parking is affordable ($16 CAN).  I'd suggest getting a room at the end of a hallway as the door / elevator noise was a bit loud. And of course if you can get a north facing view that would be nice!,2018-02-12T04:12:06Z,54

When I arrived to check in, the front desk staff was very friendly, informative and knowledgeable about the SPG rewards. We ran into house keeping during our stay and even the housekeeping staff was friendly. Great customer service.

The hotel was comtemporary.. The rooms were comfy, clean  and spacioius. It also has a kitchenette and our view was quite nice. 

We also took advantage of the pool, hot tub and sauna and didn't have any problems. The  pool, hot tub and sauna was kept clean. We didn't know where to get towels and asked the lady that was working and she was very kind to go and grab some towels for us at the pool.

It's great they offer complementary breakfast to their guests.

2129,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"Pros: Clean and quiet.  A good (not great) bed to sleep on.  Breakfast - Std. Average Buffet style.  Alright if you are on the run next day and need something to get you going but average at best
Cons:
- No Valet that we saw.  Self park only, which is fine unless you are running behind schedule and need to get to an event.
-Do not go downtown unless you drive yourself or you can guarantee your form of payment will work in train station machines!!!!
-We are from Washington State.  Thought no problem, we will stay here and ride the train to Rogers Arena...  Train payment machine could not read my debit/credit card, did not take US $, credit card payment required pin, which I never use because I do not use it for cash advances and have never been asked for that in any machine or other establishment abroad.  Luckily a local resident helped us out.
- Return trip from Rogers Arena at 1:00AM- No UBER!!!  We found out the hard way Taxi's downtown do not like to go to Burnaby from the ""Pourhouse Restaurant"" staff on Water St. (Great spot for cocktails/Happy Hour food btw). We could not get a hold of a Taxi service (sat on hold forever), we had no luck flagging one either. Called the Element - Front Desk told us he would give us more taxi numbers????  Listen we are stuck downtown!  That was the best you could do to help 2 of your guests from out of town get back to the hotel?  Luckily overpriced Limo showed up out of the blue.  Paid $112 CA to get back to the Element..  Needless to say, we were not impressed.",2019-09-23T03:32:51Z,54

The hotel look is confusing as it looks like a business office rather than a hotel, visually unpleasing even though I understand what they're trying to go for, it's not working with the modern business office look. I will say that the customer service is awesome. They answered all my questions about the room. The conference room is modern and updated. Lots of space.",2017-01-10T23:39:40Z,54

I got upgraded to a suite and I loved the decor and the fact that were was a kitchenette in there (not that I used it). Some of the minuses are that I found a pretty long fair on the wall of the shower and that parking in the garage is hard to find. Not to mention the spots are pretty tight. Location is very good - across from Metrotown and the mall. It wasn't a bad value. I think my rate was $160CAD. It's definitely far away from downtown Vancouver, but the train is nearby I believe.

Convenient and helpful to have the fully equipped galley style kitchen for cooking and the free breakfast buffet has a great variety. 2 suggestions are to 1) improve check in - It's usually fairly slow and not particularly friendly. 2) the hot tub isn't actually hot, just kind of tepid water.",2017-03-27T07:27:05Z,54

Thank you for the wonderful hospitality.",2018-08-20T06:00:32Z,54
2139,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"This is such a welcoming place. I had a junior studio with a full kitchen. It was stocked with anything one would need to cook a meal. The room was simple, beautiful and immaculate. I was pleased there was a recycling bin, iron, ironing board, and hair dryer provided. Every single person from check in to housekeeping was kind and generous. There is a hot tub and pool ( which due to a crazy tourist schedule designed by my brother I never partook in). There is a lovely, intimate bar with reasonably priced cocktails, and a restaurant as well which I did not have a chance to eat in. We did have some amazing dessert in the bar provided by the restaurant. 

The funny positive thing to mention is that the whole place smelled lite- fragrant...just enough to say ""clean"", but not  "" perfumy"".

This hotel is very convenient to Vancouver's great public transit, namely the sky train which has stops in downtown zones of interest. There is also a grocery across the street if you get a room with kitchen, and a couple of malls if you are missing anything.

My only complaint is that the free breakfast ended so early on week days. This makes sense for business people, which I know is the priority at this hotel, but for those of us on vacation ( who get up at 5 AM for work in regular life and want to sleep in), it means likely never getting this amenity. But I do realize this may be a matter of practicality for food and employee budgeting. I just wanted to mention it as its extremely likely I will return when I next visit my brother in Burnaby.

I really can't recommend this Hotel highly enough.",2016-05-01T05:25:24Z,54
2140,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"Centrally located in Burnanby/Metrotown, this Westin hotel is just outside of Vancouver. It was conveniently located from all kinds of tourist sites we planned to drive and visit. The hotel was clean and modern, amenities were basic, but nicer quality. Beds were comfortable, the room was clean from corner to corner. We had an upper floor room and the view of the city was pleasant. Check in staff was attentive, not exactly friendly, but never rude. Other than check in and out we did not have much interaction with staff, sometimes it's relaxing not to be over attended to and annoyed. The surrounding city felt relatively safe, but the parking accommodations were nicer than other hotels we stayed at in the same area, nice not to worry about your vehicle. This hotel is directly across from a little mini mall that includes a liquor and grocery where you can get easily walk right across and get the simple stuff without having to drive and look around an unfamiliar city to find what you need. Within a five mile radius of the hotel is a huge shopping mall and more interesting food than you could try in a week visit. Pricing here at the hotel was a bit higher than some other local hotels, but it's much cleaner, more modern, and parking is better. The restaurant in the hotel was not all that, but something close where you can get some drinks. 

I cannot believe we ended up with the flu the first couple days in Canada. I am glad we were on the road to recovery by the time we checked in at The Element Hotel so we could enjoy it. Remember all the suited up young hockey players staying here for some event. I was tickled when we drove out for food locally and stumbled across a Me n Eds pizza, my favorite childhood pizza place in California, where?....in Burnaby BC of all places.

Minor nits (but still rating is 5 star):
1) Parking is combined with retail (?) parking, so it is a bit confusing

The hotel rooms feel like condos themselves!  Wood flooring, floor to ceiling windows, modern everything.  The property is very clean, and about a 10m walk from the Metrotown SkyTrain station, which is about a 20m ride to Granville Station in the heart of Downtown.  We usually come to Vancouver by train, so being close to transit is important to us, while its not right outside, it wasn't as far as it seemed at first.  You can also catch the 19 bus right outside to Stanley Park via Downtown Vancouver.  Service has been very pleasant, we were upgraded for my birthday on our second visit, upgraded on the first as a promo.  So far this hotel has been very competitive in price, for what your getting, its a great value and will keep me coming back.  Free breakfast is offered as well, and the first hotel that has breakfast past 9 or 10am!  We tend to sleep in and miss most breakfasts, but theirs is until 11, perfect!  Consider this place for your next stay!",2015-12-24T17:43:58Z,54
2146,Element Vancouver Metrotown,4.1,"This hotel is all its amped up to be and more . Classy and beautiful,The whole place is sparkling clean. There are even staff walking the parking garage sweeping tiny leaves and bits. The rooms are great and have all the comforts of home. My only issue is that I think the beds could use a couple extra pillows as the ones provided are not super fluffy. The robes in the rooms are a nice light weight and have a velvety texture , super comfy. Organic toiletries that smell great are a very nice touch. grocery store across the street made it so  easy to utilize the kitchenette  ( which I recommend as the store in the lobby doesn't have a ton of healthy snacks or meals for your late night cravings and all decent food  places stop delivery at 11 pm). Staff are very friendly and helpful . We would return in a heartbeat.",2015-12-10T20:24:18Z,54
2147,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"Yelp Review 2023 #246:

After years of running and volunteering Lululemon Seawheeze Half Marathon, I've established Pinnacle Hotel as one of the best hotels I've stayed at. The location is absolutely fantastic as it's a short walk to the Convention Center where race packet pickup is at. The start line is also nearby. It's located in Downtown Vancouver next to the water so you can board your cruise ship. The Waterfront train station is also pretty close for getting to/ from the airport and other parts of the city. There are plenty of restaurants and businesses in this area.

The staff are friendly and helpful from check in to checkout. I've never had a bad experience at this hotel. I normally get 2 free welcome drinks which I don't ever use since I don't drink.

The rooms we've been in have been ample in size. My very first stay here, I  had a great view of the harbor and I would watch seaplanes takeoff and land. Toiletries are provided. The flatscreen TV is small but does the job - I only need it so I can fall asleep at night. It's quiet. And when there's 3-4 of us, they put us in adjoining rooms and we can open the doors and turn our rooms into a suite.

The room rates are competitive for the area. The hotel is a bit older and could probably use some revamping.",2023-11-11T00:51:06Z,139
2148,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"Another stay at the Pinnacle Hotel. Not much has changed in the last year. Still the same outdated carpets and such but that is okay. Their quality of service is good and the rooms are clean and appropriately appointed. This time we brought our Golden Retriever Stella with us. We haven't traveled with a pet to a place like this and it's a bit of a challenge to get her outside from the 10th floor but we managed. There is an extra charge for a pet, of course but we knew that going in. We will probably stay here again.",2024-03-22T04:33:47Z,139
2149,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"Chose this hotel because it was close to the Princess Cruise Terminal and the price was fairly decent. If its you first time in Vancouver and don't plan to drive more than 30 mins away then I would skip the car rental because Pinnacle is close enough to downtown that you can walk, catch a bus, uber, lyft or taxi. I booked through hotels.com and one can choose free parking or free breakfast. Nonetheless we didn't have a car so we opted for breakfast which came to about $36 per person not including tip. The Breakfast buffet changed daily but offered the typical American Fare, eggs, sausage, bacon, fruits, grilled veggies, potatoes, pastries. We did get a city view room and it was quite beautiful, the gym was outdated but sufficient, indoor pool, on site restaurant and gift shop! 
Pet Friendly - One-time fee of $35

2152,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"We stayed here for three nights after a cruise. People will say that you can walk from the cruise ship to the hotel, we're in our 60s and in pretty good health but when you have two large suitcases and two carry-ons, it's a bit of a trek. When you get off of the ship, they have a well oiled process of getting a taxi, it took no time and it cost us $5! 

The hotel was referred to us by friends and we were not disappointed, however, the price was a bit much but then again, you are at the waterfront and walkability is great!

We splurged on a high rise, premium waterfront room and we were not disappointed! Some reviews stated that the hotel was getting tired, I beg to differ! We travel fairly frequently and we were impressed by all that it had to offer.  Our room was huge! I'm a clean freak and the room was very clean. I won't walk barefoot in a room but in the morning I didn't put my socks on and by the time I went to shower, I was amazed that my feet were clean, that never happens!  So I'm not sure about the tiredness of the hotel, I thought it was just fine.

The bar & restaurant on site were great!  Just remember, if you're coming from the states, it's much easier to just pay with a credit card for everything while in Canada because it automatically converts the Canada $$$ to USD, which at this point, is less than the CAD.

It's a short walk to the beautiful waterfront walk! We rented electric bikes to ride thru the awesome Stanley Park, I highly recommend it, so may trails with one that leads to a waterfront trail.

I would highly recommend this hotel. Some friends that we went with stayed in a standard, well known, small hotel several blocks away and that was quite the surprise for them, they were so disappointed. While we enjoyed hanging out in our room, they couldn't stand being in theirs.",2023-05-26T17:20:45Z,139
2153,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"We had an average two-night stay here during our first visit to Vancouver.

The check-in was easy and quick. The room was nice and tidy. However, the parking was $38 per night after tax which I think is steep but having it was convenient. The hot tub was out of service which we were looking forward to using so that was a big disappointment.

The hotel is close to many restaurants, landmarks such as Canada Place, and waterfront viewpoints which we explored just by walking. The other tourist spots such as Stanley Park, Capilano suspension bridge, and Granville island market are all a short drive from here.",2023-04-09T13:22:47Z,139

Floor 16 provides a great view and the enclosed balcony was a fun addition. You can open the actual window on the balcony to get some fresh air. 
Side note, the fries at the restaurant are amazing! Highly recommend!! The sandwich was ok but the French fries made up for it lol

The rooms are spacious and the beds are comfortable. The decor is slightly dated and they REALLY could use some more electrical outlets by the bed. Its 2016 people, I shouldn't have to pull the bed to find a outlet to plug my phone. 

That being said, I really like that the rooms have big windows and nice Juliette Balconies to have some fresh air. 

As for the bathrooms, they are on the somewhat small side and they could use some better bathrobes. That being said, they do offer some nice bath products and everything is very clean. 

The gym is basic but has most of the standard equipment. They also have a nice pool. 

The staff is just lovely. They make you feel valued and treat you extremely well.",2016-09-22T10:57:18Z,139
2159,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"This hotel should get three stars, but I will rate it four for the following reasons. 

1. Location - In Coal Harbor, and within walking distance to other neighborhoods such as Robson Street. It was extremely convenient for shopping and dining. The view of the bay and mountains were spectacular from our room, and kept my fiancé and me in awe throughout our stay.

2. Price - Regardless of the location, the hotel price came around to ~$560 for three nights, which was definitely a bargain for a hotel in the middle of Vancouver with these splendid views.

3. Service - The staff was very attendant, room service did a great job cleaning our rooms, and the hotel had our room ready when we arrived early. 

4. Bed - The bed was very comfortable!

5. Clientele - The clientele leaned towards a more mature and developed crowd. This was excellent because we did not experience any loud music and partying in the hallways or in the lobby that would resemble a spring break in Miami. This definitely was conducive for a relaxing stay. 

Things to Improve On: 

1. Interior - The hotel should definitely go through a renovation in terms of furniture, carpeting, doors and elevators. They seem to be relics of the early 1990s, and there is a lot of wear and tear in them. That being said, I never thought the hotel seemed dirty. The old and beaten furniture made the hotel seem outdated, but not dirty and unsuitable to stay at. I think the hotel would start looking like an old relic of these renovations are not undertaken over the next two to three years.

2. Wifi - The internet coverage was very spotty and non-existent at times. In this age where people are using their phones and are online all the time, it is necessary for the hotel to keep up with the times. This is especially for foreigners who don't have international phone coverage. 

3. Breakfast - I feel like if you charge an extra $20 per day, people would be happy for a complimentary breakfast. This takes a lot of the hassle out for travelers, and would be a big asset.

4. Lobby - I feel like the lobby space was not used effectively. The front desk was too far out. There should be more chairs and desks to allow people to sit and lounge around while waiting for others. 

5. Noise - The AC system and the sound of other patrons definitely were loud and kept my fiancé up in the night. I think this ties into the overall thought that the building is in need of renovations. 

Despite all of this, we had a pleasant experience at the hotel, and we would recommend this location to others!",2015-09-05T04:53:14Z,139

2163,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"First of all it is not harbor front. It is across the street. It is harbor view and the view is great. Parking your car is $27 + tax a day in a dingy, confusing lot below. Most hotels have free coffee in the lobby. At Pinnacle, it is an outrageous 3.00 a cup. The restaurant in the hotel isn't so great either. I ordered a blackened chicken rice bowl and it was so dry the waiter brought me soy, hot sauce, Pico de Gallo and Chipotle mayonnaise to make it edible. The restaurant charges &4.00 for coffee. 
As long as you know all that, the rooms are nice (make sure you are not by the elevators because you can hear the 5 elevator cable noise in your room, and we have 2 lamps that are crooked with damaged shades that look like there was a wild party in here) the view is great, location is good, nice workout room.

The room was a little bit outdated but it was clean and felt comfortable. Also the shower had amazing water pressure. It was walking distance to a lot of things like the harbor and restaurants. The parking lot was also right under the hotel and some of the elevators go directly to the parking which was nice instead of switching elevators at the lobby. The staff were friendly and welcoming.

The lobby is clean, nicely decorated, and spacious. We got to see cruise ships come in, geese flying and landing to the left building. From birds to helicopters, airplanes, and boats it was interesting to watch. There is a bistro downstairs that serves delicious food making it convenient.

2174,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"A tip from a seasoned cruiser advised us to arrive a day or two early prior to embarking on our cruise to relax and unwind from our flight. Best advice ever because I booked a room for me and Dan three days prior to sailing and it was with Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront. 

We arrived early in the morning, which our front desk person, Richard shared check-in time wouldn't be until three BUT if a room opened up early, he would contact me. He also shared while we wait, we could eat breakfast at their bistro and would give us a fitness center pass (since we didn't have our room yet). He also assured us that they would store our luggage until then. 

After we ate breakfast and toured the fitness facility, we went back down to the front desk area to inquire about nearby stores and activities. As we sat down in the lobby area to research the maps, Richard came up to us with our ROOM KEY. If we wanted to hug him because we were actually tired from our flight but I didn't want him to feel like we were strong arming him for a room. 

He was so nice and said they also gave us a complimentary upgrade with a room that overlooked the Harbour! 

As I'm writing this, they are down to one working elevator and I'm hoping for the best because they were trying to make the best of the situation as the guests wait by passing out water and juice as we waited in line to get on the elevator.

We check out tomorrow but I had to write this review because the customer service has been stellar. 

Service: Professional, friendly and accommodating 
Price: Reasonable (keep a watch on deals or price drops)
Rooms: Clean and roomy! 
Amenities: Free WiFi, fitness center, car rental on site and more 
Recommend: Highly

2176,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"I have stayed here on a number of times. It's a nice hotel, in a good Coal Harbour location, with really great views, when you stay on the harbour side. 

Staff are usually great. Many times, when available, they will give you a complimentary upgrade. 

They have a nice pool and hot tub in the fitness centre. The pool is one of the deeper ones I've seen in the city, which is great. It used to be open 24/7 but not any longer unfortunately, I really enjoyed that. Now it's open until 1130. 

What could be improved on, is the decor  ( see acid flashback rugs and orange chaise lounges ) Head office, one word - UPDATE!!

It also would be great if they had plug ins for phone charging beside the bed. Even better, if they had USB ports. What they do have instead, is clock radios with iPhone 4 chargers on top. Again -please UPDATE!! 

They do have iPads in the lobby to use, as well as iPhone chargers. This time they aren't iPhone 4 thank goodness !!

I hate to complain, but another annoying thing about this hotel are the elevators. Some don't work, and the ones that do, tend to stop on random floors for no reason.

The kind staff found me another room that solved that problem.  The breakfast menu is overpriced and the choices average.  I didn't care.

I stayed here for the views -- they are spectacular -- and the time in my room was spent looking out of my room.  Coal Harbor is fascinating to watch from sunrise to sunset.  The sun, the clouds, and even the grey gloom change the appearance of Grouse Mountain every few minutes.  The sea planes taking off and landing every few minutes, the boats gently going back and forth, and the lights turning on and off in the adjacent condos make this must-see TV (without the TV).",2018-09-22T21:26:02Z,139

Pool was full and looked dirty.

2181,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"Overall, the Pinnacle is a solid 3.5 stars.  I went toward 4 stars instead because it definitely was closer to 4 stars than 3 stars.  I would stay here again as long as the price is right. My mom and I scored a deal as the prices skyrocketed after we booked the room. 

After we checked in, we received a call to make sure that we were okay with the room. I thought that was a nice touch to the check in process.
 
Pros:
+ Comfortable beds with 3 very soft pillows
+ Clean rooms
+ Fast, free internet
+ Nice lobby area with couches to sit on and infused water from lemon rosemary to mint & orange.
+ The hop on- hop off bus stopped right in front of the hotel
+ Free bicycle rentals (never used it, but saw other people)
+ After checking out, they let us keep out bags there since our flights were later in the day.
+ They had a nice lounge/sitting area located right outside the gym area.

Cons:
- Towels could be softer
- Super soft pillows. I had no issues with this, but my mom likes more firm pillows
- The pool and hot tub definitely need to be remodeled.
- The room itself was fine, but definitely outdated and needed new paint.
- The door to the bathroom was hard to slide open and close

I was trying to ask if they could locate some laundry I had inadvertently left in the room. Eventually I did manage to speak to someone at the front desk - I explained which chest od drawers I left the clothes in........ multiple calls later I was told they had conducted a thorough searcj and found nothing. I wrote a complaint to the hotel contact line and asked them to please check out my room one more time.lo and behold , this time they found the clothes. I was told I could come pick them up and was given a claim number and asked to inform the front desk of my planned arrival time 1 hour before I got there. I did this..... when I arrived at the front desk they said they had no record of my package and the claim number I had given them was wrong because that claim number was a ring not clothing.

We spent the night New Year's eve and Maya was the worst. We requested cutlery for our take out, and she said she could not get us any. She suggested we eat our food out of paper cups, or request cutlery when we ordered food (which we obviously did, but did not receive).

After day 3 of our room not being done we called down to the front desk. Apparently they don't tell you or post it in the room, but you have to request your room to be cleaned 24 hrs ahead of time.

No ""perk"" for telling them that we were celebrating our anniversary.  But we did get a room on the higher floor and it was pretty spacious.  We also got the nice harbor view.  Bed was comfy, for the most part, the room was quiet enough.  Bathroom could've been slightly bigger.  Friendly staff and they included two complimentary water bottles everyday.  I also got a free $20 CAD Starbucks gift card from joining their Pinnacle Club. 

Wifi was reliable, there was a complimentary 24 hour pool and fitness facility and first come first serve Cadillac car service from 10AM - 6PM.  The location is good, short 10-15 minute walk to shopping on Robson, Gastown in the other direction is a short walk as well, there's the bank next door and a Whole Foods like store a couple blocks down.

Voicemail system gives you three options (one is Reservations) and then says, for all other inquiries stay on the line. I stay on the line. They send me to a reservations voicemail anyway. The reservation system gives me two options, the second of which is, for general inquiries press two. I press two. It takes me to a reservations agent anyway. I convey my dismay to the Reservations agent about the voicemail routing system. She says she cannot transfer me to the correct person, but can give me a phone number. I take the phone number and call. And I'm exactly right back where I began, with a voicemail system that says stay on the line ""for all other inquiries"", and then sends me to reservations anyway. This is a pretty expensive hotel for the voicemail system not to be able to do really basic routing work to get you to a person.",2023-05-25T11:07:35Z,139

However, I've seen way better 4 stars hotel, this one is a hard 2. Our room had two very uncomfortable double beds (which were single beds honestly), the desk chair was in a horrible state. While looking for my slippers under the bed, I found a brush full of hair. Twice we tried to go to the pool, the first time it had two teenagers running around, screaming and jumping in the pool... the plastic chairs around were all wet and dirty, I didn't know where to sit. Second time, there were ladies in the pool fully clothed and the chairs and table were dirty with empty bottles and other trash. On our first morning there we decided to get breakfast at the hotel, unfortunately we were told that they were under staffed and had to find somewhere else to eat. Overall, the worst hotel I've been in a while... needless to say that I do not recommend and I won't be going back.",2021-08-22T16:33:01Z,139

The room felt larger than normal, probably because of the huge wall of windows (w a balcony!) facing the ocean. The front desk staff were friendly and especially so when I said it was my first time there... they provided lots of information on things to see and do, which may mean I stay for a weekend next time to enjoy the city.

And, the hotel restaurant was also great - I didn't do their breakfast buffet, but I did enjoy their west coast Benny... I mean, you're in the home of smoked salmon, how can you not indulge? :)",2019-03-04T15:44:07Z,139

Parking is available for a hefty fee in their lot.  Best to visit after 2200.

While the lobby looks great the rest of the hotel has been renovated, it still feels very dated.  Certain parts of the walls have obviously not been touched since the 1970s.  It does show.  With that said, the view from the rooms is fairly decent.  My friend's room also had a balcony that barely has enough room to stand in.

Cons: broken ice machine on 6th floor, water and ice Flooded everywhere. Had to keep getting ice on 10th floor. Loud air conditioner and loud machine noises could not let us sleep! Complained and offered comped breakfast vouchers, offered to change rooms or refund our money. Given we were with a kid and already unpacked it was not a convenient situation. Pool is small, not enough sitting area, when we went it was filled with kids splashing and obese men doing cannon balls getting me drenched! Reallly douche bag? In a small tiny area?? The spa was tiny.  Our room had a musty smell, and we had a balcony to try to air it out, didn't help. Our balcony had no chairs , nothing to sit out, the robes were sticky and grimy and my sis who never complains who is used to 5 star accommodations was grossed out. 
Parking: valet vs Self Park.
After reading several reviews prior from elites I wanted to update. There are 2 parking options within the hotel. Self parking where u get a ticket from the hotel upon check in & registering your vehicle with Unlimited ins & outs you have a daily rate of : 
You go into an underground parking garage where the ceiling is kinda low and u have to be careful u don't scrape your vehicles roof depending on the size of your car. Parking on B and C level are good and you have to follow signs "" public parking and Hotel. Where you can find hotel parking and elevator to hotel. 
Then Valet: also has unlimited in & outs with daily rate of  $35 US a day. 


Decor: out dated floors with weird space like old palm springs 60s design. Down stairs lobby was more modern in design but don't let down stairs fool you. It reminds be of a bait and switch in Vegas a long time ago. Down stairs restaurant ok, then golden nugget style rooms and decor upstairs! 

Amenities: pool and gym on the 4th floor. Restaurant and gift store.

What's up with the s l o w elevators ? Why don't they all work ? Why do they stop on random floors when the button hasn't been pushed every single time ?? 

Why is the carpets so tacky in the halls ? Why does the tacky carpets look rather nice compared to the ugly old orange carpet in the rooms ?

The color sceme of baby poop yellow also needs to go !!

The one room had a sliding door for the bathroom - and it was off its hinges and had a large space where anyone could peek in !! *shudders* 

Bellmen are always too busy chatting among themselves to offer bag assistance!!  

It's also the only hotel where security has asked me If I was staying there (when I was on the iPads in the lobby ) - how rude !!!

But there are some upsides - room upgrades, decent staff,  harbour views, and often you can get great discounted rates on Hotwire or Priceline.

2199,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"The staff are incredibly accommodating. Parking is ok as long as your vehicle isn't taller than 6'. It's location makes it great for walking everywhere (driving is not advisable, parking is impossible here compared to Edmonton).

I think my biggest issue was the elevators. Three of the six were working, two were only available for the floors above the lobby and for anyone who was able bodied to use the stairs could only use the stairs between the parking levels and the lobby. The other 18 floors you could not use the stairs, fire exit only. I wouldn't make this 3 star review if it weren't for the fact I overheard someone complaining about this being an issue last March. And with a convention happening on the second floor it made it very time consuming to get around the hotel. 

Overall the price for a weekend stay was good.",2019-11-17T19:16:24Z,139
2200,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"Conveniently located right in Coal Harbour steps away from the convention center this location offers lots of things to do all within walking distance.  We stayed here for 1 night as we had an event that we were attending and the cost of the room was less than the cab ride to and from the event.  Checking in and parking was a bit confusing, this hotel does not have a driveway for you to pull your car into and checking before parking, there are several spots out front where the valet is setup but we had to circle a few times to find a spot across the street to temperately stop and check in.  Check in was quick and prompt and no complaints.  Note that the hotel itself does not have parking and uses the public parkade located underneath the hotel.  If you are doing self-parking, you need to go to the parkade and get your ticket, park the car and then bring the stub back to the reception to have them verify and grant you in /out access.  A bit inefficient way to do things so word of advice is to park your car first, get your ticket and then check in so you only have to go to reception once.

We were given a room on the 18th floor, city view with a king bed.  Room had all the basic necessities and was quite spacious.  Our room did have some issued but the fact we were there for only 1 night and was there as a place to crash after a night out of town we decided to make a big deal out of it.

Our room was somewhat still dirty, hair in the bathroom, makeup stains on the bed cover.  We removed the cover and it wasn't really an issue anymore.

Sound insulation is questionable, our room was situated right across the Marriot and even with us being on the 18th floor and their large exhaust vent being just above ground level we would hear it hum/whirl all night as if there was construction vehicles outside our window. 

The worst part was we checked in and the left shortly and didn't return till past midnight, the HVAC was not working properly.  We had set it low as we prefer to sleep in a cooler environment but the room never got cold, when the HVAC would turn on it sounded like there was something loose in the vents and it kept clicking.... Clicking all night making it quite difficult to have a good night's rest.  We ended up opening the sliding door to cool the room down before attempting to go to bed.

Overall for the price we paid and the quality of the room.  We will most likely not be returning.",2019-11-18T20:00:35Z,139

Valet parking is still not available after 11 pm and the restaurant closes at 10 pm ... Still seems to be something consistent with the other reviewers but not a big factor in my experience.

but overall the property is clean quiet, the staff friendly and the food as good as that found in the other area hotels .... but more reasonably priced.

2202,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,What a dump.  Rooms are outdated and worn.  Hair on the bathroom floor.  Fingernails by the coffee pot.  Spilled coffee still on the tray from prior occupants.  Crud on glasses in room and bar.  Food is deplorable.  Views might be great but overpriced and disgusting.,2019-05-05T22:14:43Z,139
2203,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"I agree with the person who said that this 4-star hotel is more like a 2. Extremely overpriced for a hotel that is not very nice or well-maintained, even with the discount I got through Priceline.

Right off the bat, our room was downgraded to a Cityside view, even though we had paid extra and booked in advance for a Harbour room. Makes no sense and seems a bit scammy.

The cleanliness of the rooms leaves something to be desired. Our room appeared clean-ish, until you looked closely. There was dirt in the corners. I should also note that I woke up both mornings with a stuffy nose, headache, and watery eyes, a sure sign of dust/allergens in the room.

Let's not forget the best part -- the shower in our room was clogged and regurgitating some sort of gross debris. The first night, we had to call the front desk for help, as the drain was completely clogged and wouldn't drain after a shower. It took a while for the plumber to come and put a bit of a damper on our night, but he ended up fixing it (for the time being).

Fast forward to our second morning, where we woke up to this lovely sight (see photos). The shower had regurgitated more debris overnight, after making all sorts of strange noises the previous evening, forcing us to close the bathroom door to be able to sleep. I was glad to be leaving at this point.

I mentioned the shower issue to the lady at the front desk during our check-out. While she was very nice and apologized on the hotel's behalf, all she said is that she would ""make a note"" of the issue.

Other small issues worth mentioning:

The power outlets on the desk didn't work for more than 2 minutes. Couldn't even charge a phone, and had to boil water in the bathroom.
The mini-fridge made loud, grating ringing noises all night long.

Expected more. Won't be back and wouldn't recommend to anyone.

UPDATE: It looks like all The Pinnacle can offer is a flimsy apology. As two university students with a limited budget, this was a splurge. We looked forward to this getaway as a chance to spend time together, and the issues I outlined greatly affected our enjoyment of the weekend. For such a big hotel chain, they sure don't stand behind their hospitality. Comping us for a night would've been the least they could've done. It certainly would not have affected their budget as much as it affected ours.

Also, it's flat out deception for a room that you booked and paid extra for to somehow be ""unavailable.""",2017-03-20T20:30:16Z,139

When we walked over to the Marriott across the street to ask a question (we were not staying there) they greeted us and offered us bottled waters. We decided to have a cocktail there as we felt welcome by kind words. The Pinncale Hotel bar lacked character anyway.

The front desk staff were very unfriendly, I was very upset to hear that the valet service was not available after driving for 10+ hours. The lady at the front desk told me I should have read the COVID-19 notice on the hotels website. Although I went back and checked after the fact and nothing about valet was mentioned.... it just stated that some services were unavailable at this time. But when you go to the parking tab on the website it mentions valet and it's cost.. very misleading as I booked this hotel just for the valet services. Already frustrated about that, the lady then said ""well another thing you aren't going to be happy about is that we don't have housekeeping right now either. No one enters your room"" which I found very rude of her to say... I understand that things are different because of COVID and I get the housekeeping but the tone of voice and words used was very unnecessary. Especially after driving all day and that is my first encounter in the hotel. 

Not to mention the room was not clean when we entered. Dust everywhere, gross things on the ceiling. The chair at the desk was so destroyed, I can't believe they let me be there. SEE PHOTOS. No wonder the price was so cheap....

I did and it as fine but a bit disconcerting.  

We had the city view room, the location was so noisy, sounded like a helicopter was outside our window the entire night (we were on the 16th floor). Worst two nights at a hotel ever, maybe it was the air conditioners or something.

It cost about $275 per night including taxes, which to me seems pretty insane.  But I got a wonderful room on the 16th floor facing North, so excellent views of the north shore mountains and burrard inlet.

We booked a Standard Water View Room and were placed in a room 9 floors from the other folks in our party (I booked 2 rooms together). I asked for my room to be changed and was changed to within a floor of our other family members. Our room ended up being higher but our view was not as good as our other family members. Their room had a much better view of Coal Harbour while ours had nearly intimate views of neighboring apartment buildings. 

Our room was very comfortable and nicely appointed. Truly, I have no complaints about the room and the accoutrements in the room. My only complaint was noise. Initially I only noticed the elevator noise while in the bathroom. But that turned out not to be the case. I heard the elevator all night long. It sounded like the machinations of an amusement park roller coaster...up and down. Here comes a car, there goes a car.

The location is amazing. We were within walking distance of Canada Place and Robson Street. This is a very walkable hotel and neighborhood. 

Upon checkout I mentioned that the elevator was very noisy. She asked if I called to complain. No I did not. Moving to a quitter room in the middle of the night is not something I like to do (done it, it's not my favorite). Instead, our valet parking was credited for the night.",2015-10-17T03:31:42Z,139

There is room for improvement mainly with the extremely slow elevators whose buttons flickered a bit. Not really striking confidence in the minds of the rider but they are in the midst of replacing the elevators so that should be a temporary problem. It seems like it's a bit of an older hotel that's been renovated so there are some touch ups that could be done. The crown molding in our room was coming away from the ceiling on one wall and the ceiling is popcorn, so kind of gives away that the place is older but like I said, clean! 

Loved the instant hot water in the shower (hate waiting for the cold to turn hot), the bed was soft and plenty of pillows and the room was spacious so we were pleased overall.

Talked to a manager about it, and all she said was the valet attendant shouldn't have told me the parking garage was cheaper nor does it cost a ""x"" amount of money because they charge hourly. They then explain they're not affiliated with that parking garage... that their OWN valet attendant recommended and told me to go to instead. Didn't do anything to compensate my time, money, and frustration. For a hotel, they provided ZERO customer service. I guess I'm use to Vegas where they care more about making their customer happy, oops.

 Rooms are old fashioned. Only good thing about the room was the view. I should have just stayed at an airbnb instead *eyerolls*",2017-04-07T06:24:12Z,139
2222,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"Nice hotel in an ideal location. They have a lot of guests coming and going at any given time since the cruise ship port is nearby. They are organized, friendly, and helpful.

Splurge and get the harbor view! It's gorgeous and fun to watch planes and boats coming and going. Take warning and insist for a room away from the elevators, unless you live near a subway or train and miss home.

The elevators are the Achilles heel of the place. They are noisy and extremely slow. I got in one, pressed the close door button and nothing happened. An employee passed by and had to restart the elevator - a tad alarming.

The facilities were nice and conference/event area was comfortable. Like others have noted, it is a bit dated, but not disappointing.

The best part was the complimentary bikes! They are first come and first serve. I had a great morning riding around Stanley Park and grateful for the use of their bike.",2018-05-13T17:42:16Z,139
2223,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"As a couple on vacation, we would stay here again if the same discount were available. 
For a business trip, this hotel seems like a decent choice.

Our room was on 5th floor facing away from the harbor.

PROS:
- Location. 5 minute walk to nearest SkyTrain station, 5 minutes to harbor shore and hence to trail around Stanley Park, 10 minutes to GasTown.
- Quiet. (we never heard other lodgers through the walls.)
- Clean.
- Comfortable bed and pillows. Slept great.
- Window opens so you can let in outside air.
- Short wait for elevator.
- Fast checkin.  
- No mini-bar.

OTHER:
- The free Internet (we used with WiFi, though wireline connection is also available) worked great most of the time. On very rare occasions streaming audio would stutter.
- No fan in bathroom.",2015-09-13T02:11:05Z,139
2224,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"Stayed here for one night for work, and I have to say I was extremely impressed.The views were great, the staff was very friendly, and overall my check in and out process was a breeze.

The rooms were clean and updated. Minus one star because the sheets weren't very soft.
Still slept well regardless.

I liked that I was able to open my window/door to enjoy the crisp Vancouver air

This hotel is in walking distance to a lot of great restaurants, as well as the port (where I went the next day). I was able to walk there, with my luggage, in under 10 minutes.",2017-07-20T20:59:05Z,139
2225,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"Overall, the Pinnacle is a solid 3.5 stars.  I went toward 4 stars instead because it definitely was closer to 4 stars than 3 stars.  I would stay here again as long as the price is right.

2 bottles of water are provided in the room, a small mini fridge, but no microwave (something we were really hoping for).  The style of the room is typical and a tad dated.

Pros:
+ Comfortable beds (on the firm side) and fluffy pillows
+ Nice, larger square soap bars
+ Clean rooms
+ Fast, free internet
+ Very pleasant housekeeping staff
+ Nice lobby area with deliciously refreshing infused water from lemon rosemary to mint & orange.  Bring your own water bottle or growler, fill it up, & enjoy it all day long.
+ They offer underground parking which is especially nice on rainy days.

Cons:
- Towels could be newer and softer
- Loud noises from the AC/heater every time it shuts off

Overall, we scored a great deal in a great location of  the city of Vancouver.",2018-03-27T05:25:00Z,139
2226,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,No cleaning staff!! We were here for multiple nights and the whole staff went on strike and the management decided to cheap out and not hire additional help to service the clients! The rooms were a mess and disgusting!!,2019-10-10T04:33:41Z,139
2227,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"Love love love this hotel. I have only here once for almost a week and I loved my stay here. It's clean, hygienic and rooms are big and bathrooms are clean too. They have indoor pool and fitness center for those who like to swim or work out. The room had a work table and chair which was so useful for me since I used to work from there for at least half of the day. It had 50 inch ( possibly) tv and a mini refrigerator. I liked the fact that they had multiple mirrors for various size in the room. For girls any number of mirrors is not too many. I was on the 18th floor and so the view was amazing for me. It's in the downtown so everything was walking distance for me. All in one line: I will come back to this hotel every time I am in Vancouver.",2019-08-28T15:09:11Z,139
2228,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,Asleep at the wheel. No one cares at this place. Suffer from feather allergy and despite trying to insure that the room was free from feathers (which aggravates my asthma and causes me face and body to bloat out) and after arriving and asking and reassured the whole floor was feather free.. feather pillows in the room. Whole bunch of stuff transpired but they sent more feather pillows and on 2nd night more of the same thing. Was totally stressing stay. No one there gives rat's at this place.,2020-10-07T07:17:10Z,139
2229,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"We took a one-way cruise to Vancouver and this hotel was close enough for us to walk once we disembarked.  The hotel is not fancy, but it's clean and in a great location. We walked everywhere--Gastown, Stanley Park, restaurants. The only time we got a cab was to go to the train station on our way to Seattle.

The happy hour is really good and inexpensive. It's always nice having a restaurant in a hotel for convenience.  

I noticed a lot of airline personnel staying at the hotel and that speaks volumes. They always stay in hotels that are clean, convenient and cheap (fairly priced). I agree!!!",2017-05-21T18:18:42Z,139
2230,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"What a great hotel.  My wife and I stayed for her birthday.  We took our two dogs and it was great.  Our package included parking, so we parked our car and then I check in and came back to the parking garage to get my wife and dogs.  We grabbed our stuff and went to our room.  The lobby and halls are beautiful, clean and well maintained.  The room was beautiful with a great view of the downtown area and harbor.  The room was well appointed and clean.  The bed was so comfortable as well, our dogs love the bed.  We then took our dogs for a walk on the sea wall which is just a few blocks from the hotel.  Later we ate at the beautiful restaurant P2b, in the hotel lobby.  When we got back to the room we took a bath in the large tub.  All and all we had a wonderful night stay with our dogs.  The dog fee is only 30 dollars Canadian as well so for two it was 60, but not a bad deal.",2016-11-13T21:44:20Z,139
2231,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"I would give this place a 5 star, but I can't.. I'm still staying here for the remainder of my trip... I love it here, the hotel is beautiful the customer service is great and very helpful. My only complaint is the bed... it's so hard.... and the main thing about a hotel is to sleep, but I haven't been able to sleep. I've already did and upgrade and paid more thinking the bed will be soft but it's not...

It's been two night of no good sleep.. I'm gonna have to reconsider my stay here next time..",2017-07-04T16:54:32Z,139
2232,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"Nice looking hotel on the exterior but there isn't much of a drop off space in front of the hotel. There was a tour bus in front of the lobby so our taxi had to drop us off up the street. The space between the valet to the reception area is also all stairs. We had to take a small elevator up one level to get our strollers and luggage from the street level to the actual lobby area. It turned out to be a bit of a hassle for the days we stayed there but the elevator was luckily fast. 

The hotel itself is clean but a bit dated. It's almost like it was rebranded recently. I originally booked a partial harbour view room but was able to upgrade to a full harbour view at a small additional $10 CAD / night fee. The room itself had a nice balcony that had a nice view of the harbour.

Overall, nothing spectacular but it was sufficient for our short stay.",2019-07-31T01:10:07Z,139
2233,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"Amazing views on the harbour side of the hotel. Very quiet, on that side, and good sized rooms. I expect the rooms facing the city would be less quiet. Balconies glassed in on both sides keeps the noise out. I can barely even hear the seaplanes at takeoff. Spent two weeks here so far and am pleasantly surprised by how much I like the hotel, my room, and friendly staff. I'm a local who appreciates the great location of this hotel close to the seawall, in the central business district, and not far from Stanley Park. Everything is available within walking distance. Room 41 on each floor is very nice layout with an exterior wall on one side and an entrance hall into the unit. Have not tried their food yet. Good air, my tests showed that the hallways, elevators, and lobby seems very well ventilated with very little CO2 buildup and ok filtration, not much opportunity for SARS CoV-2 to linger in the air. I will update my review later in my stay.",2021-01-30T19:25:19Z,139

2236,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"CONS: Poor service...wouldn't stay here again. Cable didn't work, room service order was incorrect, I had to walk to the curb to get the valet attendant when checking in and no assistance with luggage up the stairs to check in. 
PROS: The bartender knows how to make a drink and service at the bar was exceptional. Room was clean, spacious had a beautiful view of the harbour. Great location.",2016-04-26T16:45:24Z,139
2237,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"I love this place! We stay here EVERY time we are in Vancouver. We started coming here because it is.... drum roll... DOG FRIENDLY! That's right, for $30 extra per night, you can bring your furry friends on vacation with you! That's a big deal to us, since my husband's office is in Vancouver and he's there all the time.

And all the staff are dog friendly, too. We have housekeeping, the door men, even receptionists constantly asking to pet our boxer-lab mix. 

That brings me to my next point: the staff are incredibly nice, welcoming, and helpful. They'll rush to call you a cab, as about your day, help you with directions or activity recommendations, and even score you a restaurant reservation. When we leave the hotel in the morning and pass housekeeping staff, they almost always ask if we need anything specific done, above and beyond new towels and a freshening of the room.

And the rooms are so nice. They're clean, with great views of the waterfront or the city.

Other reviewers mentioned that the decor looked dated and worn. I've never really thought that. I don't think the carpeting and furniture are super modern and brand new, but it's perfectly fine and lends itself to quite a nice stay. Some also mentioned how close other high-rise (apartment) buildings are. Yes, you get a really good view of the other buildings.  But I've never seen a sign of life from them (aka, people on the balconies) so I guess the only downside that comes from their presence is not being able to walk around the room naked while keeping the curtains open.

While some said the hotel was loud, I've never experienced that. I could hear some neighbors dragging luggage in the hall, but I've never been woken up by it. 

I've stayed in the hotel a couple of times and we were once upgraded to a top-floor suite. It was awesome! And we were able to do the club breakfast, which is a seriously nice free upgrade. It's nothing special, but really fun to sit in the (Vista Club, I think?) lounge and watch the city while sipping some coffee. Very nice perk for upper floors and/or frequent guests.

I've not personally eaten in the hotel restaurant. But my husband has a couple of times and says the house Cabernet is quite good. The food is just fine, though he thought the duck spring rolls could have had more flavor.

One of the best parts of the hotel is how centrally located it is. Many places will advertise how central they are... and that turns out not to be quite true. But seriously, if I could live at this hotel I would. It's right on the waterfront, a block away from the Seawall ""trail"". You can walk all the way along the waterfront on this gorgeous (VERY safe at all hours, and very clean) path. It goes all the way along Stanley Park to the west. And to the east, it goes past the Cactus Club restaurant... and I've actually never seen the end - that's how far it continues.

There's a bike rental place right along the path near the hotel - such a great way to see the city!

And the hotel really is close to so many places. The convention center, Yale Town restaurants, bars, other attractions.

I've never used the transit system, but I've walked all over the city from the hotel.

And - bonus - convenient parking!! There's a garage right under the hotel. It's not cheap, but it's much less than most nice hotels in Seattle or San Francisco, I've found. Overnight parking is about $20-$30. There was a time we stayed there that we negotiated free parking... but we haven't been able to do that since.

All in all, with the room cost (about $170 for a King bed depending on the room), cleanliness, service, etc. This hotel hits the mark. I'll stay here every time.",2015-12-07T14:58:18Z,139
2238,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"Older hotel, nothing special other than an easy walk to the convention center.  Breakfast buffet is adequate, rooms are adequate.  Seems more of a tourist hotel than business.  The lighting in the room was terrible to try and work by.

2239,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"Four years is a long time. Since my first visit my organization has sent me back to the Pinnacle a number of times.

2241,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"Overall, 3.5 for condition of hotel and 3.5 for experience, but I loved the comfort and location, so I'm giving it a 4. I enjoyed my stay, but there are some things that bothered me. Let's start with the good. I arrived at the hotel at 11AM and asked to check in early. They accomodated us. We had 2 separate reservations, 2 people each. They were going to give us both rooms with 2 double beds each. Instead, we got 1 room with 2 double beds and 1 room with a king bed (upon request). Check-in was fast and easy, and we were put on the same floor. The room with 2 double beds was a corner room, which had 2 balconies; 1 balcony was longer and narrow and faced the city and the other balcony was just a spot outside the door that faced the harbor, with a building in the center of the harbor view. The room was spacious and the views were nice. The room with the king bed had 1 balcony facing the city and the room was much smaller and cramped.

The indoor pool, hot tub, and gym were nice and in a spacious room with views of downtown. The gym had a variety of weight machines and fitness equipment - cardio machines included a couple treadmills, ellipticals, and a bicycle. A water dispenser, towels, and lockers were available. Something to mention - when going up/down the elevator, every time it stopped at level 4, it smelled strongly of chlorine even though the pool is enclosed. I would hate having a room on that level and having to pass by the pool.

The hotel has umbrellas available for use, which is convenient since it rained a lot when I was there. There is a taxi line outside, usually at least 2 taxis waiting, so no worries about calling or waiting for one. WIFI worked well. Workers always asked if they could help and also had a map ready to direct us when we had questions about getting somewhere such as Stanley Park. The location is awesome with Cactus Club Cafe, the Olympic Cauldron, and Digital Orca around the corner and P2B Bistro inside the hotel. A trail leading to Stanley Park is around the corner.

The cons:
NO bicycles for use during the winter (we were looking forward to using them for Stanley Park when we were surprised with some clear weather)
NO car service on weekends. Then we asked if we could get a ride to Waterfront Station at 6AM on Monday (with minimal luggage) and were told it's only available 10AM-6PM first come, first serve. When the other room's occupants asked for car service to the Hyatt, they were told ""no car service today, but the Hyatt is closeby anyway."" That is not the point. the point is the hotel offers and advertises this service, and only around the downtown area, so what is the point if a downtown destination is ""closeby anyway.""
TV didn't work, couldn't check messages for the room and account info & had to check out at the front desk. The other room's TV channels didn't work, so an employee had to come up and slide an updated channel list under the door.
1 elevator kept having problems and sometimes wouldn't go.

The hotel is a little outdated and will become run-down soon if they don't do something, with 1 elevator malfuntioning a couple times during my 2-night stay. It needs renovations & improvement of some amenities already being offered. The bathroom walls become damp and water seeps through. The walls are thin so I can hear others' alarms for long periods and the next room's door sounds like someone is entering my room. All in all, it is a good hotel, but I hope management doesn't throw away a chance for the hotel to grow and be better in order to better serve its guests. I don't like that the hotel offers things that it can't deliver and doesn't disclose the exceptions for bicycle rentals & car service on the website. It is misleading.",2016-01-18T11:02:08Z,139
2242,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"Wonderful location, three blocks from downtown and one block from the marina. Per night price was not bad since I booked well ahead of time on Tripadvisor. It's great that they offer a hotel taxi car to give you a free ride anywhere on the island. Another big perk is the free bike rentals, that was extremely key when considering a Stanley Park excursion. Did not give them a five star due to no free breakfast and the restaurant was not very good.",2015-11-29T21:55:57Z,139
2243,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"I stayed for 4 nights here on business earlier this week. I stayed in a double queen room. It was a good size with large windows.

The location is amazing! 5 minutes walk to the convention centre, 10 minutes walk to Robson street. Stanley Park is just so close. There is an Urban Fare just down the block for all your grocery needs. 

The hotel is very modern and the staff are more than accommodating. At one point my party and I asked the valet attendant for directions and he offered us a complimentary ride to our destination in the hotels brand new Cadillac! Seat warmers were such a nice treat on a chilly evening. 

The pool (hot tub too) and fitness centre are available 24/7. Average fitness amenities in a good sized environment for a hotel. 

 My only complaint about the hotel would be the wifi. It extremely slow, most likely because it is an open network. I also lost connection frequently. Not the biggest deal - but definitely annoying when trying to accomplish things. 

I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to people looking to stay downtown and within walking distance to tourist attractions.",2015-10-25T17:19:34Z,139
2244,Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront,3.6,"The thing I don't get, why this hotel does not just bite the bullet and do a complete overhaul?  It is not a 4 Stars hotel, that's a misleading (probably fake rating like fake news) category.  Only thing it has is its location, proximity to Stanley Park, downtown convention, and harborviews.  As far as the room goes, sorry, I have had better w/ 3 Star hotels.  Honesty and fairness is important to me.  Pushing up an extra star to charge higher rates is not fair to customers.  Room interiors are worn and dated, no wonder they are no longer a part of Marriott since Marriott demands higher standards.",2018-05-01T05:24:34Z,139

It made me feel like I was in vacation though it was my city, haha. City view room has a quite nice view of other hotels.

Yup, I'd totally stay in this hotel again.",2016-03-26T08:58:12Z,139

2247,Kitsilano Suites,4.0,"Stayed here for a week with my daughter. The house is beautiful, immaculate, the owner takes pride and gives serious attention to small details. this part of Kitsilano is one of the premier residential areas in Vancouver and this part of sixth avenue is the best part of Kits. Absolutely flawless, superbly wonderful. What more can I say?",2023-12-17T01:45:41Z,4
2248,Kitsilano Suites,4.0,"We went to Kitsilano Suites when meeting up with some friends in the area. The neighborhood was an unknown to us before the trip, but I am so glad we discovered it. It is utterly charming, with beautiful homes with incredible gardens - most with lots of fruit and veggies growing happily in them. This property was super clean, very well appointed, and immensely comfortable. Mark is an amazing host - very responsive, friendly, warm, and considerate. He thought of every detail - even tons of hangers (all of the same type, which is awesome for OCDers like me!). The garden is so peaceful & beautiful. It's super close to lots of great spots to eat, and a wonderful local market (plus Whole Foods, if you'd rather), and a great wine store. The beach is also close by - all in all, a great spot for a peaceful and relaxing getaway. I'd definitely go back!",2017-09-11T00:58:56Z,4
2249,Kitsilano Suites,4.0,"I just spent the last two weeks in suite 202 of the Kitsilano suites and it was one of the best places I've ever stayed.  I've gotten into the habit of renting an apartment for a few weeks while on vacation and I'm always looking for interesting, comfortable, and livable places to stay and Kitsilano suites fit the bill perfectly and exceeded my expectations.  

There are four suites of varying size in this lovely restored historic home in the Kitsilano area of Vancouver.  We stayed in the smaller upstairs studio, 202.  Calling a studio is not giving it enough credit.  It has more space than some apartments I've lived in!  Everything is thoughtfully arranged and set up for ensure you have everything you need, no matter if you are staying one or two days or a month.  The kitchen is better equipped than most homes and you can really cook up a storm in there, or just relax with some great wine, cheese and smoked salmon on the deck/porch out the back of the unit (there are great places within walking distance to buy things to eat in or dine out).  Lots of thoughtful touches from the art, to the wifi, to the linens, to the slow closing cabinet doors so when you are cooking up a three course meal in the kitchen at 11:00 PM you won't disturb the other people staying here.  

Only two things to be aware of, if you have  mobility issues you probably will have trouble climbing out of the great claw footed tube and the bed in 202 is low to the ground, but the other units might serve you better.  Also, you can usually hear what is going on in the hall/stairs, so you just have to be respectful of the other guests and not go crazy when you come in late.  Just ask Mark if you have any concerns.  Speaking of Mark, he is the owner, and a great host.  Very helpful and professional from the booking to checking in to making sure we have all we needed, or giving suggestions of things in town.  Plus he is just a plain nice guy!  I loved staying in his place and he is a great representative of the spirt of Vancouver.

This was a perfect area of town to stay in as well.  Quiet and homey but with plenty to do on 4th or on Broadway, just short walks away.  We walked to many places in Vancouver, as there are tons of things to do in a 3-4 mile radius.  Heck, downtown is only a 40 minute walk away!  And if you are not a walker, the bus system in Vancouver is great and easy.  There are a number of buses that stop near the suites that made getting around town a snap.  Plus, the airport is only 20 minutes away by taxi (at least at 5:00 am!) so when it is time to leave it is a snap to get there.  

Next time you are in Vancouver, try Kitsialno Suites instead of a hotel.  It will make your trip just that much more comfortable and memorable.",2013-07-24T17:50:28Z,4
2250,Kitsilano Suites,4.0,"We reside in the U.S. and made reservations through VRBO to stay at this property in Vancouver, British Columbia prior to Covid-19. We made the first deposit payment in the beginning of March in the amount of 1672.20CAD. We really wanted to take the trip so we waited to see what would happen. Well, Canada closed its borders to US tourists and kept it closed through our trip dates in June. We contacted the property owner, Mark Diesvelt, and he said that though he could not refund our money because it was outside of the 60 day cancellation policy, he would give us a credit--this was in May. He also stated that if he could rebook our original dates he would refund our deposit. Our trip dates came and went. He did not reach out to us. I eventually contacted him in July because the Canadian border was still closed. He said that he had been able to book our dates, but at a much lower rate. This amount was nowhere near our deposit amount. He then repeated that he would offer us a credit. I was concerned because this situation with the Canadian border seems to be indefinite right now and didn't know if it would take us until next year to be able to travel there. He seemed to grow agitated with my questions and then stated that ""VRBO says that I am not obligated to refund your money or give you a credit"". I then proceeded to contact VRBO directly. I spoke with them and stated that I wanted to receive a document from the property owner stating that he was issuing us a credit with dates and specific dollar amounts. VRBO sent the property owner Mark Diesvelt, an email stating my request. This was on August 5th. He did not respond. So I again contacted VRBO on August 19th. VRBO stated that there was nothing they could do. Mark Diesvelt is entitled to keep 1671.20CAD of our money without providing any service for this money and there is nothing they will do about it. In my opinion this is fraud. VRBO's reasoning is that their cancellation policy does not cover Covid-19. That is because until months ago, Covid-19 did not exist. And instead of creating an actual policy to deal with it, VRBO has decided that Mark Diesvelt can choose to keep our money without providing any service for it. Mark Diesvelt has now received two emails from VRBO requesting a document with details of the credit he previously claimed he would issue us--and has ignored both of them. Mark Diesvelt will not respond to emails regarding our deposit he has kept.",2020-08-25T17:39:44Z,4

2252,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"Short, pleasant stay. Was in town and needed a hotel centrally located and chose this Sheraton.

Check-in was smooth and clerk was friendly. Our room was in the south tower and a corner room. We had great views of the city. Room even had a balcony (but not recommended for anyone scared of heights). 

Room was clean and quiet. I appreciated that all the bathroom amenities were refillable dispensers. Bottled water, refrigerator and coffee maker in the room. (There's also a Starbucks in the lobby.)

Would stay again.",2023-02-08T15:58:57Z,230
2253,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"Definitely one of my favorite hotels in downtown Vancouver. All of the rooms have such great views of the city, all of the walls are floor to ceiling windows, which is so impressive! The club lounge is also nice and has an open air terrace which is pleasant on warmer days. Good Bonvoy recognition, very centrally located to everything. Been staying here for 7+ years now and I will continue coming back!",2024-01-10T06:06:18Z,230
2254,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"I can't decide if I should given Sheraton a 5 stars or not. Here are some pros and cons:

First the Pros:
- This is hands-down the best gym I have ever been to at a hotel. There were two different rooms just for weight training which was quite insane that they even had weight training material at all. Oh and free bottled water that was very high quality!
- Our hotel had one of the best views in Vancouver. Our views were of the sweeping coastlines from the northern mountains all the way to the southern UBC side. It was beautiful especially on a clear day. 

Cons-ish:
- Sheraton is separated into a North and South Tower and if you live in the South Tower (which I did) they don't actually have parking just for you. You park in the North Tower parking area so every time you go back to the hotel you have to walk through the North Tower concourse or outside. It's a bit of a hassle but no too bad at the end of the day. 
- Sometimes the lounge food is amazing like the fresh-baked cookies and the Asian food like the Thai curry. Other times, fruit is the only edible thing such as when they had South American night where the empanadas were incredibly dry. Honestly I really appreciate they have a lounge and fruits and really good juice, but I think the actual hot foods can definitely improve. All the waiters were incredibly nice and attentive though and immediately cleared out all the plates.

If I could give a 4.5 star that's what Sheraton would get. Almost at 5 but not quite.",2023-03-09T16:34:56Z,230
2255,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"The best thing about the Sheraton Vancouver Wall is the location.  For our last trip to Vancouver, we stayed in the South Tower where it was built probably in the early 80's.  They squeeze in a Starbucks on the ground floor which buys convenience but cuts out a big part of the reception area.  It certainly feels cramped checking in or waiting for the coming elevator.

Our room on the 22nd floor is decent and we got a good view of the skyline.  The ceiling is low and hallway is narrow.  Sheraton should boost up their upkeep to earn another star.  Otherwise, this is close to restaurants, grocery stores, shopping, Stanley Park, and the wharf.",2023-07-14T17:06:39Z,230
2256,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"A lovely Sheraton situated in downtown Vancouver close to shopping, dinning and other leisure activities - BUT....

Be prepared for an exterior that is throw back to the 1980's - evoking a feeling of padded shoulders, slicked back hair and cell phones as big as bricks. 

Seriously though - a property that has been upgraded over the years, but beginning to feel a bit dated. Lobby is split between the two towers, so you can check in on either side. Solid onsite dining, with a good little bar. Layout to get to the gym is funky, as you actually have to walk outside to access the gym. If you are tall - well prepare to duck - low ceilings throughout. 

Two story members lounge in the West Tower - moderately priced drinks and the happy hour and breakfast offerings are legit - we stayed two nights - only ate out once - basically had dinner at the happy hour - score. Hotel is dog friendly - so bring your four-legged pet. Parking lot is a bit of a tight mess - but hey - it wasn't built for today's crop of huge SUV's.

I recently stayed at the Sheraton Wall Centre and i loved it.  Our room had a nice view and we were on the 18th floor.  We live in Seattle and go to Vancouver every few months and this was the first time staying here and i will definitely be back.  The staff was wonderful, efficient, helpful and informative.  When i reserved the rooms i added on the breakfast which was a great option.  The breakfast was a full buffet in the hotel restaurant, very nice  our room was priced at $200 plus $24 for two breakfasts Canadian dollars. .  

The bed was comfortable, and the room was roomy.  These rooms in the South Tower had been recently renovated and over the desk was a wonderful 55 inch flat screen, which was perfectly situated to watch from the bed.  

The location is awesome.  We decided to walk downtown and when we got to the Lobby it was raingin out but that's typical in Vancouver in November. the concierge was very gracious offering us umbrellas for our walk.  The hotel is a few short  blocks from the main shopping district including Hudson's Bay Company (founded in 1670) and A brand new Nordstroms (which was incredible)  We went through the Pacific Centre Underground which was fun and kept us dry.  

We got back and dried out from our walk and got ready for Dinner.  We had dinner across the street at the C-Prime restaurant which was also incredible.  

What a wonderful weekend and thanks again Sheraton Wall Centre for a great visit.",2016-11-13T03:45:08Z,230

Definitely waste of money since there wasn't any extra services with the room we payed for. Disappointed. 

I will consider staying here again for the convenience and the location is perfect, just a normal room next time.",2018-05-13T06:33:28Z,230

Some challenges: you have a shared bathroom between the two rooms. There is no common space between the rooms so if you want to watch something then you are sitting or laying on beds. The Tv's in each room are great -- nice sized flat screens. The views are great from the corner rooms!,2016-11-26T20:24:11Z,230

I had recently hit platinum with SPG and the Sheraton Wall Centre  staff made me feel every bit of elite. My room was upgraded at check-in and was immediately given access to the club lounge. The location is what makes this place very ideal for out of towners because its centrally located and within walking distance to Robson St and restaurants/shopping. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because the concierge desk was not as helpful as I'd like. There was a young lady (who's name I'll reserve to say) that could've cared less about my needs or my time. She made very little eye contact and was more worried about people watching then the questions I had.

Anyway, this girl was like""we don't allowed more than 2 person in one room, and there is gonna be extra penalty charge if that happens"". Me and my friends was talking in Chinese and I swear she was Chinese, cause she understood what I was talking. But still she told my friend that in English.(what a fake bitch).

One of the windows faced the hospital across the street but we heard sirens just a handful of times so it didn't bother us.  For those of you who can't find plugs and USB ports, it is built into the nightstand on the side facing the bed.  The room had everything we needed.  Pool is in the south tower.

2274,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"I bought the Sheraton Wall Center package, which included an airline ticket, from Costco. I recommend that you do not book a family suite unless you have small children because it is a tight hallway with two rooms and a bathroom, and the rooms are small. Families should reserve two connected rooms. For various reasons, I recommend not renting a car. The first reason is that hotel parking is $58.00 per night. The second reason parking is difficult to find. Is it much cheaper to take Lyft or Ulber? Lyft is slightly less expensive and more convenient in terms of time. Aside than that, you only needed it for a few destinations like the airport to hotel and return, Stanley Park, and Olympic Village.  Outside the Hyatt hotel, there is a free shuttle that will take you to the Capilano Suspension Bridge Park, which is 4 blocks from the hotel, or Canada Place, which is a little further away. Restaurants is on Robertson Street and shopping is on Alberni Street, which is a short walk from the hotel, so wear comfortable shoes. There is an Fat Mao noodles restaurant across the driveway from the hotel, and there are several restaurants on Hornby Street, which is across from the hotel. Do not go to Chinatown because it does not exist and is overrun by homeless people who are high on drugs, making it unsafe to stroll about. I recommend that you take a Lyft to Olympic Village and Stanley Park. Other than that, you can roam around the city and do your own exploring.",2023-11-04T19:34:27Z,230

Sprinkler head was drippy and heater made noise like one at grandmas house. No balcony. Guest service staff was mediocre. Slow to respond to request for extra blankets because we couldn't stand heater noise. Not sound proof. We heard doors slamming in our floors.

Even the security guy was nice to talk to as I waited for my driver at 4am.  Sheraton is conveniently located and is easier to get an Uber at the drop-off area rather than on the street.

We got a good deal off Travelzoo and chose the 1 night stay with parking and breakfast. We were assigned a room on the 18th floor. It was a decent sized room as I wasn't too fussed as it was clean and big enough for 2 for 1 night. 

You can see the hotel took precaution with COVID:
Lobby cleared with seats separated more then 2 meters apart, plexiglass at check in and staff with masks, and sanitizer everywhere, including in the elevator (first I've seen). The pool was closed but the fitness centre is open but must make reservations. 

The only thing is I am not used to hearing multiple  sirens. I slept ok considering, the bed is comfortable. 

The breakfast included was to dine at the restaurant in the hotel, Cafe One. It was really good as we were advised $30 each and I like to chose my food, a la carte.

Upon arrive, I asked one of the bell person to help with some luggage but they went back into the building and didn't come back. I had to wait outside in the pouring rain for 10 minutes for the other bell person to assist us.

Another issue is the lack robes and slippers. When asking the front desk for some robes and slippers., they said that they have ran out. So going to the pool was a horrible experience if you're staying in the South tower. You have to go down a cold hallway and also walk outside. In the fall and winter, this travel is super cold. In additon, when I wanted to go back to the hotel after the pool, they make us buzz back into the building. What's worst is that nobody was there to buzz us back in and we waited outside in freezing temperatures and wet body/hair. We had to walk in the rain to get to the front entrance.

2286,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"Upon check-in, it became very clear that the Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre hotel is geared towards businessmen, not families or couples or even businesswomen/female travellers. 

The hotel room had no microwave, the mattress was very firm, and ALL of the toiletries were scented like strong male cologne (bar soap, liquid hand soap, hand lotion, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash). The scent was so off-putting for myself (as a woman) and even for my male partner... I phoned the front desk to ask if they provide unscented products because the strongly-scented toiletries were aggravating my allergies but was told there were no alternatives.

Apparently there are a few floors that offer more amenities geared towards women but staff said even those rooms use the same (cologne-scented) toiletries. 

We didn't bother to try the breakfast buffet because it was highly priced ($36/person!) Meanwhile, the hotel's à la carte menu isn't much better... for example, a lox and cream cheese bagel for $20! We decided to eat out at the restaurants nearby, which offer better and more reasonably-priced options. 

It would be nice if the bath robes were soft terry cloth - instead they are a thin fabric. I really appreciate when hotels offer slippers but alas this was not provided at the Sheraton Wall Centre. There also was no extra blanket in case another layer was desired.

As for what I liked, the water pressure was pretty good in the shower, and the hotel offered feather-free pillows upon request. The floor-to-ceiling windows provided lots of natural light. All in all, I would not stay here again.",2021-09-27T21:59:31Z,230

I had a colleague say the same thing but I don't know which room he was in, but we were both in the North tower. The rooms are clean, pillows and bed were comfy.  Bar staff was nice, though drinks were pricey. There are no vending machines or otherwise for snacks or drinks in this hotel - sad.

2290,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"Our hotel for two nights was the Sheraton Wall Centre in downtown Vancouver. It was an easy walk from the AirTrain that I took from the airport. It's about $8 for a one-way trip from the airport. I got out at the City Center and it was about 8 blocks to my destination or a 10 minute walk. The valet associate was telling us that I could have gotten out at the Yaletown stop and walked 7 blocks even though Google Maps told me to get out at City Center. I arrived and was able to check in. They have two towers and my reservation was for the South Tower but I was in the lobby at the North Tower so I checked in there. When I made my reservation, I asked for a few requests (higher level room, feather pillows, away from elevator). I was able to get 2 out of 3 but despite being closer to the elevators, we didn't hear too much noise from them. We were on the 24th floor and could still hear sirens in the middle of the night (there is a hospital across the street). The room was clean, comfortable, and spacious. The bathroom only had a shower, which was fine but I would have loved to see a tub. They utilize a card system which shuts off the lights when the card is not in the slot. I asked for two cards, as it was me and a friend. The double beds were comfortable and the air blew cold. 

We found the gym and worked out both mornings before heading out. The gym had basic amenities so there was a pool, Jacuzzi, cardio equipment, and separate weight room. I was really excited to see that they had muscle roller sticks as I was sore from a run. We enjoyed the room. No free breakfast on this reservation but we got a discounted rate for the Seawheeze weekend. Apparently there's a Club Lounge that we weren't aware of that had breakfast and happy hour drinks and a rooftop. Strange that we weren't told about it, but oh well. I was happy for the cleanliness of the room, the location of the hotel, and the pleasant stay. On the day we checked out, we asked for them to hold our luggage for a bit, while we went to check out the Farmer's Market. Afterwards, they hailed a cab for us to take us to the cruise terminal at Canada Place. As a BonVoy Marriott guest, I received 2 bottles of water complimentary in the room which was nice.

2291,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"With only one day in Vancouver, which is obviously not enough, we took it upon ourselves to reserve a night at as nice of a hotel as possible. Enter the good name of Sheraton, whose mighty skyscraper overlooking the city enjoys a convenient, easily accessible location downtown. We had a friend drop us off at the front, so matters of transportation were no issue. Upon check-in, we were met with some phenomenal customer service. The front desk receptionist, Jesse, confirmed our one-night stay and, without any prompting, took it upon himself to find us a corner room on the 24th floor. Was it Canadian hospitality, prestigious Sheraton service, or both? Whatever it was, the time he took to accentuate the pleasantries of our stay was deeply appreciated. We collected our keys and turned the corner to the elevator. 

As we opened the door to our room, we were immediately dazzled by the view that unfolded before us. Now, being a first-time visitor, I don't know much about Vancouver, so I couldn't tell you what specifically we were looking at. Hopefully the photos do the view the exemplary justice it deserves. 

Fatigued, hungry, and too lazy to venture to the many available eateries outside, we ordered seafood linguine, fish and chips, and (for me), a glass of merlot for room service. We have only ordered room service a handful of times, and normally we are told to anticipate a 45-minute wait or longer. This dinner was carried in less than the 30 minutes we were advised on the phone, and the meal exceeded expectations! It was a good day to dine in. 

This hotel is conveniently situated. There is a convenience store around the corner for any quick needs like water bottles and toiletries, a Starbucks downstairs for obvious Starbucks reasons, and - if you're interested in taking the Canada Line from place to place - a station ten minutes away on foot. We'll be keeping all of this in mind for a future visit. One potential inconvenience: there is a hospital across the street, so expect to hear sirens from time to time. In fact, being downtown, anticipate sirens of all sorts. They did not bother us, however. 

We knocked out early and, sufficiently above most of the light pollution, left the drapes open to take in the nighttime view. One refreshing sleep later, and we were back at our travels. Check-out was easy; there was a queue of taxis awaiting patronage outside. Just flag one and they'll come around to get you. 

I wish we could have stayed longer, and when we return to Vancouver, I'd like to make the Sheraton our go-to hotel again. The staff were truly kind, dinner hit the spot, the Wi-Fi was free, hell, even the shampoo, conditioner, and lotion were particularly ambrosial. For all who consider this place for their Vancouver stay, I recommend the Wall Centre Sheraton five stars over. 'Til next time, and hopefully sooner rather than later!",2019-09-08T16:18:43Z,230
2292,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"The staff will give you the run around about e-gift cards. I had one for $250. It was an incentive to apply for the Marriott Bonvoy credit card. When I arrived at the hotel, I told the front desk about it. The clerk told me to wait until check out. That was a red flag, but I didn't want to make a scene. The lobby was packed with people waiting to check in. I asked a different front desk clerk the next day and was still told to wait until checkout, only this time I was also given an email address to forward the e-gift card to. Another red flag. I knew there would be an issue when I checked out. Sure enough, the clerk told me because no manager was on duty to authorize it, it could not be applied to my account. Now I got angry. I feel like this hotel had no intention of ever honoring the e-gift card. They would have applied it to my account when I first asked, which is what most hotels would have done. I don't understand why a Marriott hotel has a problem accepting a Marriott e-gift card. I have contacted Marriott about this. If one of their properties is going to treat their e-gift cards like this, they should know.",2022-09-06T19:08:58Z,230

2295,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"This place isn't worth the money. There are numerous other hotels I would rather stay at then here. The only good thing is, that it is centrally located. The walls are thin enough, that you can hear even a low level conversation in the next room. It's impossible to call down for any service because no one wants to answer the phone. You have to go down to the lobby to ask for anything. They overcharged our room and we had to get a manager to solve the issue. Save yourself the headache, and stay somewhere else.",2021-10-23T16:27:12Z,230
2296,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"For the price, the quality is so low here. We were really surprised. When we went to the restaurant, they didn't want us to sit on the patio, giving us the reason that it closed in one hour. Our waiter was nice, but the manager was super rude, The food was very basic but expensive for the quality, and there were no cocktails on the menu. It was clear they just didn't want to carry the food out to the patio if we were the only ones there. We had come for one special night as a staycation, they made it clear they were annoyed and wouldn't didn't  tuen the heater on. The pool said it closed at 11 online, we went just after 10 and it was already closed. The pool was one of the reasons we chose that hotel.",2021-08-21T18:53:13Z,230
2297,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"Clean, comfortable rooms. The lounge is one of the key reasons that I like staying here. They offer a nice breakfast and appetizers in the evening. The lounge does get very crowded on weekend mornings. Just go earlier to avoid the crowd.

The staff here is nice and attentive. 

Main issue here is that the building is dated and the rooms are a tad old through seems like most items were recently refreshed. Just have loud noises from the ice machine so don't get the -15 rooms that are next to it. Also, the heating system is uneven. Sometimes very CD sometimes very hot. Just signs of an old building. Also, the noise from the hallway travels easily into the room. Not an issue unless guests are hanging in the hallways.",2018-12-29T20:08:23Z,230
2298,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"This hotel was the best... We were so happy with our stay here! The hotel is located right in the middle of Vancouver and it's walking distance from everything. My boyfriend travels regularly for work and has a high member status with Marriott/Starwood hotels, so we were given a free room upgrade to a suite that had a master room in addition to a larger room with two more beds, all with a fantastic view of the city from either room. Best of all, we had access to the exclusive Club Lounge on the 25th floor where we ate breakfast and came by multiple times to grab snacks and drinks. The employees treated us very well and we felt over-appreciated for choosing this hotel for our weekend home. I highly recommend staying here if you plan on visiting Vancouver!",2018-09-19T17:24:04Z,230
2299,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"Dayum, this hotel is nice af. I stayed in the North Tower, which is newly renovated and home to the hotel bar (#priorities). There is also the South Tower, which has a swanky lounge with expansive views of Downtown Vancouver.

The North Tower is where the party is at tho. There is a lobby bar with live music each night, which I enjoyed one of the evenings we stayed there.

The room was large, clean, and cold - all important things for a weekend getaway. For being such a large hotel that hosts many conferences- it wasn't loud at night which was great!

The north and south tower are connected with a breezeway, which was convenient as some members of the group were staying there (aka how I know about the swanky lounge). There is also a Starbucks connected to the south tower.

Service at the hotel was friendly, and pretty speedy. This is not the most economical choice in downtown Vancouver, but for an SPG property you do get your money's worth. Quality stay with clutch location. I would gladly stay here again!",2018-07-12T19:51:15Z,230
2300,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"I have been to this property a few times now, and each time there are reasons to scream.. FIVE STARS, and there are reasons to scream...  LESS THAN FIVE STARS... eitherway, when the math works out, I landed with a solid 4 stars.  

In the centre of town, the location makes this hotel a must, just near enough to Robson and the main shopping areas, as well as just a few blocks away from the noise of the town. The hotel is shiny, and during our first time there, we found out there are two towers, a fitness centre between the two, a nice bar/cafe, and rooms which fit the need. 

Finding the hotel is somewhat strange, I recommend when you get there, drive into the hotel property, as if you were going to valet, and let the folks there know you are looking to check-in.  They will kindly let you leave your car outside, take your keys, an give you the moment to get all booked/register. Once you get that all taken care of, finding parking is the next challenge... you'll drive around the block until you find a driveway for the parkade.  Know that you will likely drive past it on accident, we did, but once you are in, there is parking all around.  

In the hotel, there is a Starbucks for your morning needs, as well as lobby that is staffed at all hours.  Rooms are varied, view rooms are nice, they have floor to ceiling windows. The staff there are nice, customer service is always something they do well, even when things are not right, they work to take care of it, quickly and promptly.  Even when we had to wait in line for service checking in, they provided an accommodation for the wait, which was unnecessary (we didn't want that long), but it was their way to saying, sorry, and let's make this right. 

The cafe/bar.. known is Bar One, was pretty good.  Drinks were done well, and food was tasty.  The staff at the bar were generous with their time, checking up on use regularly, and we were pleased.  

I don't think there is a person at this property that doesn't want to see the customer feel welcomed, and we definitely felt welcomed. Would we come again? Yes.",2018-06-28T05:05:35Z,230
2301,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"My boyfriend and I stayed here on a Saturday night over Good Friday weekend.

The feel of this Sheraton is upscale and modern. I really liked how clean the place was and the service was great! There was a doorman who came out to greet us and helped guide us on where to go.

The employee who helped us check in was awesome - he asked about our trip and put us in a room away from the elevators so we could rest up and not be disturbed. He was also asked us which tower we wanted to be placed in, as one had the breakfast area and one had the pool and hot tub.

The room itself was really nice! It was big and spacious and there was a large TV in the corner that we could watch from the comfort of the bed. The bed was big, clean, and comfortable. It was so nice to sink into it after a long weekend of skiing. The bathroom was also clean and well put together.

We were to check out Sunday at noon, but called the front desk around 10/11AM and asked to extend our checkout to 4PM. The employees were accommodating to our request and pushed back our checkout. 

I had a great stay at the Sheraton and would highly recommend it to others. If I visit Vancouver again, I'd love to stay here :)",2018-04-06T05:09:28Z,230
2302,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"The location of this hotel is great. I stayed here just one night after coming back to Vancouver on an Alaskan cruise. It was about $8 for the cab ride from Canada Place to the hotel. There are 3 towers, and we got dropped off at the South Tower for check in. There is free wifi in the lobby, and the guest rooms, so they must have recently started including wifi for free as some reviewers said they had to pay. But it was free, and fairly fast.  

I checked in and was assigned a room in the South Tower. When I got to my room there was a letter on the desk stating that there would be no power that night due to maintenance. Well, I find that completely unacceptable and I am not willing to stay in a room with no air conditioning, lights (they said flash lights would be provided) and 1 elevator (this is a high-rise tower) when I have paid as much as I did for this hotel. I got a deal on priceline, but the regular rate was around $350. I will never book on priceline again because every time I get placed in a hotel that is undergoing maintenance or has some kind of problem. So I suggest calling this hotel before booking to make sure that it will not be undergoing maintenance. They did not tell me when I checked in about the power issue.   

I called the front desk and asked to be moved to another tower. They were nice about it but I could only get a double-bed room instead of what I had booked, a king room.  So I feel that I got ripped off.  Aside from this, the room was nice and clean and the location was great. There was a starbucks in the south tower.",2016-05-16T19:51:41Z,230
2303,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"I recently stayed at the Sheraton Wall Centre for 12 nights. I'm happy to say that it was one of the nicest hotel stays I've ever experienced. The staff were super friendly and accommodating any specific/special request I had. 

Upon arrival, I walked in to find a welcome card and plate of mini cinnamon sugar donuts with a bottle of Pellegrino. Nice touch! Parking is normally $30 per night, but it was comped for the duration of my stay, which was fantastic. 

The room was a good size with a comfortable King size bed and a desk for working (or eating take-out, in my case). The TV was probably the low point, in the sense that I couldn't use my Apple TV with it. Most likely due to the fact that I didn't want to pay an extra $10/day for faster internet connection. I just really hate commercials so watching regular TV is a painful experience for me, since I can't fast-forward through commercials. The TV itself was a good size with great picture quality, though, so it's ""first world problems"" for me, essentially. 

They do have free ""regular/low speed"" wifi, for up to 3 devices, which works just fine for standard use. 

My South Tower room had a balcony, with two chairs so I could sit outside and enjoy watching the sunset with a glass of wine. Great view - I just wish I'd photographed the sunset, but alas, I forgot to grab the camera. Unfortunately, the weather did not cooperate on other nights that I was in the room at the time of sunset, so I missed my only opportunity. At least I was out enjoying the beautiful weather every other time!!

With a long-term hotel stay, you are offered a chance to earn rewards points in exchange for having your room serviced every few days instead of every day. This is absolutely fine for me, so I gladly signed up. I just needed to ask for extra coffee (Starbucks!) and bottled water when I ran out. The final point to note is to say the microfiber robe they offer in the rooms is seriously the best one I've ever worn and I plan on buying one for home. So luxurious! 

I will definitely stay at this hotel again next time I'm in Vancouver.",2016-08-14T20:08:39Z,230
2304,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"After getting invited to a wedding in downtown Vancouver, I booked the Sheraton Hotel at the Wall Centre for its location. The Sheraton is right smack in the middle of downtown Vancouver, but after checking in we realized how nice of a hotel and its convenience. It was close to the wedding venue two blocks away and everything was a short walk. I rented a car but wound up parking it for most of the weekend at the hotel. We checked in and they up graded my room. I got a room on the 24th floor with a great view.  Since we ate out every meal we did not get to try the restaurants or the bar. Parking was $30 per day. The hotel staff was nice and attentive. There are shops and restaurants all around the hotel. The beds and bedding were the highlight of the stay just a good as any 5 star hotel I've ever stayed at.",2017-10-07T07:42:04Z,230
2305,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"Location!  Location!  Location!  The Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre has it!    I've always passed up staying here because I thought it was too far from Robson.  But this past August I was proven wrong.  The location is pretty good!  It's close to Robson (for shopping and restaurants) and Granville (for you party people)!

This past August a group of us came here to celebrate our buddies' birthdays!  We shared a couple of spacious rooms that were well appointed.  We all raved about the beds!  They were sooo comfortable!  The service was great, and very quick to respond to our requests for more supplies (towels, pillows, blankets).  The view from the room was a-ok.  And they offer free wifi that was reliable!  The lobby bar was also a nice spot to hang and grab drink while passing the time away (or take shots with the bday boys)...

My one complaint is about the parking, it is a bit confusing if you're doing self parking.  You have to enter off one of the side streets and the garage is like a maze, with tiny parking spots.  Other than that the Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre is a great place to stay!",2015-09-19T11:08:53Z,230
2306,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"For my very first trip to Vancouver I decided to stay here. As a solo traveler I wanted to stay close to everything and this hotel didn't disappoint. 

The hotel is located in Vancouver and is walking distance to great shopping. I was able to take the train from the airport as well and walk about ten minutes to get to the hotel. Another plus is that this hotel is located on the route for many tour buses.

I'm only giving the hotel 4 stars because the hallways were very dirty. They needed to be vacuum. Check in was a mess due to the number of towers. Lastly, I was charged incorrectly and had to call to get everything fixed. I would consider staying here again if needed, but probably would go to a different part of town.",2019-09-26T11:08:36Z,230
2307,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"Not a bad experience. Very welcoming, warm and always willing to assist or help with anything I needed. I opted to do the green pass which was opting out of room cleaning, new towels, and new sheets on my three day stay and each day I got a $5.00 voucher to use for coffee or food. (Yes, they can be combined.) On my last day I ran out of coffee (yes, mini coffee makers in the room) and they ran some up to me!

The room was cozy but roomy enough to stretch out. Wall-to-wall windows was cool. Because this place is located in the hub of the fun, the views were nothing to put your nose up at.

Be prepared to hear the city noises if you stay here.
If you are able, bring a fan (or ask for one) to drowned out the sound. I don't mind city noise so it wasn't a problem for me.

I attended a conference here and food was amazing! Like, amazing! (I am only speaking to conference food not restaurant food) If you are coming here for a conference, definitely stay here if your conference is on location. 

I am unable to speak to the pool or workout room because I was too busy exploring the city that surrounds. There are bars, eateries, shops very close. Don't eat at the hotel. It is insanely overpriced. I walked a block and got a $1.50 coffee at Tim's as opposed to a $5.00 drip coffee on location. Same with food. 

You won't be disappointed staying here.",2017-11-03T15:43:06Z,230
2308,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"Came by for a banquet dinner.

Parking may or may not be free.  I think it depends on the deal the event organizer has with the hotel.  In this case it was free.  Otherwise the rates are pretty insane.

Because of the small footprint, the meeting rooms are upstairs, and the ballrooms are downstairs.

If the event is baller enough, this place can host a mean party.  The event I attended was a buffet, and I was ready to cry when I saw the sheer amount of food available.  Almost as far as the eye could see.  Staff were very efficient, and kept the food rolling out and the tables cleaned.  They were almost too good, as my buddy and I had to take turns guarding our dishes so that they wouldn't get taken away if we went for a drink.  Their pasta and seafood dishes are much better than other hotels.  The prawns in their prawn salad were the size of my palm.  The only dish I found to be not so good was the fried calamari in the takeout containers.  They tasted a bit stale.  Might be because they were put under the heat lamps a little too long.

In terms of throwing a big bash, this place is a close second to the Westwood Plateau Golf and Country Club (which is my local benchmark).

I still have dreams about the food here.",2016-02-11T15:07:51Z,230
2309,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"We found a great deal for a Club Level King sized room with a view at the Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre and we had an unbelievable anniversary weekend. 

After a minor booking hiccup (Sheraton didn't get all the details of our booking) we headed up to our room after a long afternoon drive up from Washington. I just want to say that the team at the front desk quickly honored the proper accommodations once we showed them our email and apologized for the mistake. 

The view from the 24th floor is absolutely stunning at sunset. The bed was amazingly comfortable. The bathroom was really comfy. The club level was a great plus-up for the morning hangover breakfast and slightly drunk midnight snack. 

It's located downtown, a few blocks from Davie village and not far from Gastown or Yaletown so after doing some shopping it was perfect to drop the bags off before going out for the night.

View from the 24th floor was amazing! So much so that we decided to get room service deliver our dinner. Had a salad, fish and chips (which was excellent - one of the best I ever had) and a bottle of wine.   

Only downside was getting the room service fees.  Once I saw the print out there were all sorts of add ins including a gratuity.  That was very annoying because I gave the guy a generous cash gratuity not realizing it was already included.  So food was around $70 and all the fees were $55 more.  Grrrr.",2016-03-15T05:00:44Z,230

Gym, bar,  restaurant and conference are in a separate building, which is not bothersome. In fact it helps keep the noise down. The club lounge has plenty of offerings and it's nice to have breakfast along with water and coffee whenever you want. Seating in the lounge is also unique, with a spiral staircase and an outdoor area where you can enjoy the views in some peace and quiet. Been to Vancouver twice and stayed here both times. Wouldn't hesitate to stay again as the proximity to the water, shops and local areas (ie Stanley Park, Gastown, Yaletown, Granville island, Canada place) is perfect.",2019-05-12T10:42:29Z,230

They did a great job on trying to rectify the situation, but unfortunately we were worried the whole time about bringing bugs home with us even with all the cleaning etc. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone at the moment until they eliminate this problem. I'm so happy that I was with my boyfriend because I almost didn't go. If I hadn't been there he wouldn't have noticed and most likely would have brought bed bugs home with him!!

I have to say the braised short ribs was very memorable. It was was delicious that I was hungry at the start of the event and after eating the braised short ribs, I was even hungrier (because it was too delicious). But whats disappointing was the apple crumble with graham cookies bit was nasty. Its probably because I never liked graham cookies.

Today the Asian Real Estate Association of America (AREAA), had their annual Vancouver chapter convention at the Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre. I had to say over 150 attendees. The food was pretty good. For breakfast there were blueberry scones; however they were a bit cold. for lunch, I loved the Pita Bread, I was made perfectly. There were lamb and chicken skewer were not bad. A bit dried but with Tzatziki sauce it was ok. After 5pm, there were shrimp dumplings, shuimai, xiaolong bao; weird gyoza that stuck to a leaf and flat bread. The 5pm or social time snacks were ok. Maybe they are not specialized in making Chinese dumplings. I did like the flat bread.

Overall the venue was very clean; very spacious and staffs very helpful. What was awkward was how the hotel had the internet user capped at 35. About half way through they realized what went wrong with the internet, they immediately removed the cap.",2015-06-18T05:49:26Z,230

Central location with shopping & entertainment walking distance in safe good area.  But no where near parks & water, just to let the tourists know.  

There's North & South towers, with the former carrying most of the events & banquets, like today's annual Van Mag Restaurant Awards. Luckily there's a cool corridor that connects the towers.  

Starbucks in either one too. 

$15 parking for 3 hours is a STEAL given prime area.  

Love the lobby in North, it's the better, more recently renovated too.  Lots of space, lounge chairs & gorgeous washrooms without any fear of security lol.

The hotel, yes, is nice and right in the middle of the action: Near the epicenter of downtown and the gay district, surrounded by the full range of restaurants, boasts free music on select nights, has a wine bar and a dining room, a 24-hour cafe, a lap pool and attentive room service. 

But there were a couple of glaring concerns. First, every time the shower curtain got wet, there arrived the strong stench that it may have mold on it. Granted, this is likely an isolated event, and when after removing the curtain there has not been a problem. Nonetheless, it was concerning. 

Also, the room service prices are quite steep for what you are getting. I much preferred getting out of the hotel anyway, finding more reasonable selections even within one block of the hotel. 

And the staff, except the concierge, interestingly, tended to be quite curt. 

Then there is the pool. The hotel has a strange configuration. To get to the pool, you have to cross some of the conference rooms, which can be slightly embarrassing as you are getting to and from the pool in your robe or wet suit. And, bummer -- the sauna was out of order (as of 04/15/12), though there is an infrared sauna that you can rent, but for a cost. 

But the views are very, very nice.

Free Wi-Fi and free printing services for guest is a tremendous plus! 

The bed? Amazingly comfortable! 

The grounds are lovely. 

And, again, the location is simply perfect.",2012-04-16T19:46:56Z,230
2325,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"We stayed 2 nights after getting off our cruise trip. Booked this reservation on hotwire.com and they only revealed the name after confirmation. We got lucky to get this property and were looking forward to staying there. 

We liked the location, decor, and also the amenities that come with it. They offered free Starbucks Coffee pouches to make individual cups in room, Tazo tea bags and 2 free bottled water daily. 

They also come with a small refrigerator in room and free Wifi. 

We stayed in South Tower and got a decent view from our room to see the bay. 

You can walk to Davie Village, downtown, Burrard station, Yaletown skytrain, etc within 15-20 minutes. That was what we did to explore the area.

Btw, there is a starbucks coffee shop right next to the lobby in the south tower. That made it so handy to get some drinks and pastry items there for a quick break.

I believe it is a great value and we will book it again if we are in the area.",2018-05-18T17:32:41Z,230

2327,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"I had a good two night stay at this hotel.   It is beautiful and centrally located in downtown Vancouver.  My room had an amazing view of the city, a comfortable bed;  perfect accommodations.  The only issue, though minor, would be to secure the safe in the room a bit more securely to the wall.  With some effort, it could have been easily removed.  Also, it would have been better located in a more accessible location instead of the top shelf of the closet.  It required that I stand on my tiptoes to sort through what I had placed inside.  The cafe downstairs was perfect for breakfast, staffed by the most efficient, professional staff I've ever encountered.  Although expensive ($500 America/night) and out of my budget, I'd definitely consider staying here again in the future.  Nice!",2018-07-30T16:45:09Z,230
2328,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"I stayed here recently when I was in town for SeaWheeze. Overall, it was a positive experience.

As an SPG Platinum, I am supposed to get the best room available. I was quite surprised that I was assigned to the South (unrenovated) tower. When I inquired, I was able to get a room in the North (renovated) tower, but not with my bed choice. I opted to go that route.

The room was large well appointed. I appreciate that the fridge can be used versus being a mini-bar with no room for storage. I had great floor to ceiling views with stunning city lights and the water in the background.

The North tower is slightly closer to the action on Burrard Street (by a block), so if you will be on foot, this will make a bit of a difference. It was about a 20 minute walk to the Convention Centre and waterfront, which is where I was going to/from much of the weekend. 

As a Platinum, I was given complementary access to the Sheraton Club Lounge, which is located in the South tower. It has breakfast in the morning (the hours didn't work with my schedule, so can't comment on this), beverages available throughout the day, and hors d'oeuvres and sweets in the early evening. There was always plenty of food. Alcoholic beverages are available for a fee. Some of the lounge staff were very friendly, while others were more aloof and barely acknowledged your presence.

Contrast that with any of the housekeeping staff... whenever I would encounter one in the hall, they always greeted me and were super friendly.

I did have one snafu... upon leaving, I departed and didn't get my bill at the front desk since they email it to you. When I got the email, I was stunned to find a $120 charge on my bill for one of the restaurants, since I had not taken any meals on property. I called the hotel and one of the staff looked into it. She called me back a few hours later and had removed the charge. Apparently, someone had written my room number on their bill, but didn't have the name right. The restaurant had not cross-checked and had billed through. It was annoying, but I appreciated that it was quickly resolved.",2015-08-30T19:30:33Z,230
2329,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"Great hotel, amenity and location

I redeemed a 2 queen room for a 3 night family stay pre-cruise. We were in the old wing, the common area is dated and could use some update. But the room was clean, spacious and comfortable.

Gym and pool were good. I had the SPG status and the Hors d'oeuvre (shall I say meals) offered in the club room was AMAZING. 

Vancouver city does have amazing food offerings but I would come back to this hotel just for that reason!!! Book the club room!",2016-04-04T15:55:53Z,230

It has 2 towers, a residential tower, on site ATM, and cold beer and wine store.

Located steps away from  Robson Street, Granville Street & Davie street. This puts you right in the middle of Downtown Vancouver's entertainment district, perfect for shopping, dining, and nightlife. 

Rooms are a good size, beds super comfy. 
My only complaint was that the last time I stayed, that the chair in the room looked like it had been used for some wild sex, as it was covered in dry white crusty matter, that suspiciously looked like .....

Anyway, the girl at the front desk offered to change rooms, but I preferred the original one. All in all, great value for the money!",2011-12-15T08:50:53Z,230
2332,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"I had spg points that I used to stay here....not a fan. The front desk was super nice when I arrived and she gave me free drink vouchers. The room is like your average Sheraton room...but she gave me a super sweet view so that was cool. The hotel is kind of old and elevators take FOREVER to come.

Parking costs ~$45 a night which I thought was ridiculous. They give you a discount for being a guest but it still comes out to like 40.I know parking downtown can be expensive but usually if you're a guest it's significantly cheaper. The front desk who checked me out wasn't friendly either. I just wanted to check out but she looked like she just didn't want to work or help anyone. 

Location: 5/5- close to everything 
Service: 4/5
Rooms: 3/5 but with the view 4/5
Club lounge: 2/5- wasn't a fan of the layout or food selection

Note: Go to Robson street to exchange USD to CAD for good rates

The bathroom is clean, nothing fancy or superb, just average clean! The room service is horrible, barely any choice and expensive! Really really below my expectation for a 5 star!!!",2020-02-07T22:01:58Z,230
2334,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"Rooms look better in pictures. They are small. And the cleaning not that good. My bath tub had yellow stains... YUCK. During the two nights the light of the room were turning ON and OFF by itself. Scary !

2335,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"I travel for business a few times per year, and have a required rate that hotels have to fall within.  Luckily the organizer of the conference I attended had room blocks for most of the hotels in downtown Vancouver, and I was able to get a room at the conference rate, which fell within my allowed range.  

The last time I stayed in a Sheraton (in Memphis), the hotel was one of the most disappointing hotels I've ever stayed in, so I was a little nervous.  However, I can say that my stay at the Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre was GREAT!

The first thing you will notice is how clean and modern-looking the hotel is both in the lobby and the exterior building.  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.  I had a few questions during my stay, and the staff was great in helping me.  The hallways are clean, and again, very modern.  

The room itself was very clean and modern as well, and the staff did an excellent job cleaning everyday.  

I have to say, I was upgrade to a club-level guest, and had access to the club level, which was amazing.  The best breakfast you can imagine, along with great views of downtown on the balcony.  They also had a ""happy hour"" meal at the club level, which was great and really was my dinner for a couple of days.

Vancouver was an amazing city to visit, and staying in such a nice hotel only made the trip that much better.  Would recommend the Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre for anyone who wants complete peace of mind in knowing that you will be staying in a clean, modern, comfortable hotel.  If (when) I ever make it back to Vancouver, I will definitely be staying here again.",2019-07-06T18:26:29Z,230

Overall, for conference proceedings, is recommend the Sheraton Wall Centre for small to medium sized conferences.",2018-05-06T00:11:54Z,230

2338,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"Pretty standard as Sheratons go - although I was given a nice upgrade to a corner high floor room with a wonderful view of the city for my reduced rate room - the cash and points option with SPG allowed me a great rate here.

But the hotel is fairly standard. There are two towers, and I stayed in the North one, which has the club lounge and seems to be a little more modern. I think if I was in the South tower and had to walk through the skybridge or outside to get to the lounge for breakfast in the morning (which is all I use it for) I might have been a little annoyed. But that's pretty minor. Otherwise, the room was comfortable, beds were standard, lounge had the standard cold breakfast options I'm used to at Sheraton properties. Location is good - maybe not as good as the W or Westin (whatever it is) on the water, but it's close to a lot of stuff and near a train station for those not renting cars. Really nothing to complain about. I'd happily return if I was back in Vancouver.",2017-07-09T23:57:48Z,230

1. Front desk is just inefficient, especially when it comes to non working keys 
2. Server at the club lounge also just doesn't give the vibe that they are helpful; one lady refuses to refill the fruit during breakfast at 7:30 AM during peak hours!!!
3. Parking is obviously very confusing as well
4. Gym is very old & not much equipments

Very nice hotel, quite large, with many amenities (including an excellent gym, spa and indoor swimming pool).  

Check-in was easy, fast, friendly and efficient and the bellmen and concierge were repeatedly helpful and full of knowledge about local attractions and restaurants.  

Rooms were large, and beds were very comfortable, and great free wi-fi.

Location is very central - you can walk to everything, and some excellent coffee shops and restaurants within just a couple blocks.

EVERYTHING was perfect ... The room, the restaurants and the Sheraton club/lounge was more than we could have asked for. Thank you so much to the Sheraton staff and especially Caitlin Kehoe, the online community coordinator. We highly recommend staying there and will be back for many anniversaries to come!

We would also like to thank Jessica from Cafe One. She was the BEST server we have had in a loooong time. She was warm and friendly yet professional at the same time.",2019-04-25T00:59:51Z,230
2343,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"We stayed at this Sheraton for our first night in Vancouver. We went to Canada with 3 other families. For two of the families the rooms were ready, but they somehow overbooked the hotel and didn't have rooms for the other two families. Basically we got a corner room with a kitchen, side bedroom and living room with a bed in it. The room was actually pretty spacious. For the other two families they offered them a suite that they would have to share. 

== Penthouse Suite ==
Absolutely beautiful! It was a 2 story suite complete with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, washer/dryer, full kitchen, dining table, fireplace, living room and a large patio with incredible views. This place was just amazing. I've stayed in several suites in Vegas with awesome amenities, but this suite was pretty nice and so spacious!

It is less than two blocks from an awesome movie theater, less than two blocks from a fabulous crepe place, all the shopping places are within two blocks as well. Overall, this place is really in the heart of a huge amount of shops, restaurants, parks, EVERYTHING. Oh and if by any chance you have some kind of accident, the hospital is a block away. 

I had a huge room with a great view of all the shops in the newer building so it was perfect. The windows in my room were floor to ceiling, one entire wall so to speak of all window. Room service was timely whenever I made a request and concierge was very helpful with any request I made. A huge plus for this place is that they allow dogs so my pooch was able to come and enjoy my time here with me. The comfy pillow top beds were awesome. If given the opportunity, I could have spent all day rolling around in bed and just ordering room service. 

As I previously mentioned, I stay here whenever I am in Vancouver which is about 4 times a year. Hopefully my great experience keeps going.

2348,Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre,3.7,"I stay here regularly and actually do complete the customer surveys when they are emailed to me after my stay. I've stopped completing them now since they must never read them because to date they have never contacted me about the service comments or my experiences at their hotel. What is even worse is I'm a Platinum member (SPG) and I guess doesn't mean very much in their organization any more.

in fact this is likely the worst Sheraton Hotel I've every stayed at in many years. I dread having to go to Vancouver only because of where I have to stay. (LOVE the city of Vancouver) 

I've had a number of bad experiences and each time advise the staff as I'm checking out and/ or during the stay. They do nothing about it.  From the smoke alarms going off as your in the shower (their response is leave the bathroom door open, and they won't go off) ?? to the rooms having weird inconsistencies - no phone by the bed, no desk (where the hell are your suppose to work), to no reading lamp on the night table and even a room, that did not have a night table, to broken hairdryers, broken irons, and glass in the bathroom floor. 

The only reason I stay here is I have to - as it is the only hotel in Vancouver our company uses - this certainly doesn't help with the frustration of the stay.

The only good part of the hotel is the services staff at valet and the front desk. Other than that the hotel pretty much sucks.
  
The restaurant is in the other building and I've only had one meal there and it was  a very very over priced (breakfast). I've ordered room services on a couple occasions and the meal was okay and afterwards regretted that I didn't go to a restaurant down the street. 

As for their Club Lounge is not comfortable at all - squeaky laminate flooring, bistro tables and chairs and believe me there is no lounging going on in this small room. The whole experience is terrible.",2011-11-15T22:58:03Z,230

But neither of the beds were very comfortable, and my back hurt, and my husband didn't really sleep that well either. The water leaked out of the shower room pretty badly, but we didn't want to bother having somebody in the room to fix it, so we put extra towels under the glass door, which got soaked right away, and had to replace it at least once a day. On the second night, I still don't know what it was, but throughout the night, there was a dripping sound I coulnd't quite figure out its source. But that was only the second night, so it wansn't that bad. 

Our rooms came with free breakfast and hors d'oeuvres, which was very nice and the food quality was SUPER. Breakfast was somewhat limited in terms of selections, and was the same every morning, but hors d'oeuvres was excellent in every way. However, you have to pay for alcoholic beverages, and the $40 bottle we ordered was a poor quality, and tasted like a $7 bottle.",2016-10-26T19:31:21Z,230

Coffee, robe and slippers all available in the room as well as the use of a yeti cooler for a day out. The hotel backs onto BC Place and Roger's Arena so it's a great location for any games, concerts and major events in the city. Yaletown is right outside the door and it's a great community to grab a coffee and stroll through. Close to the waterfront and all the wonderful things the city of Vancouver is known for. The hotel was so quiet so we were able to enjoy a late start in the morning after a late night out. Would highly recommend and hope to be back again soon.",2023-11-30T21:41:25Z,51
2352,"the DOUGLAS, Autograph Collection",4.3,"I could write a poem to this hotel about how and why I love it. Where do I start? We arrived to a helpful doorman who helped us go to the 6th floor lobby. A lovely gentleman named Eis checked us in. He recognized it was my husband's birthday this month with a little box of chocolates. So thoughtful.

We enjoyed a huge room on the 7th floor looking out toward the waterfront. The bed was so comfortable! We never wanted to leave. 

The decor is based around its name - the Douglas fir. The door is a big gorgeous wood door. Which leads to the big wood headboard. The industrial look of the concrete ceilings is complimented by industrial style lamps, fixtures, and furniture. There is no fridge, a Yeti cooler with ice does the trick.

The bathroom is vast. The shower is large. Shampoo, conditioner, and body wash by Aesop are available. No bar soap is available. The towels are big and fluffy. A robe is available too.

There are several bars and restaurants inside the hotel or you can go to the casino which can be entered via the hotel. Two have a happy hour that we loved. I can't recommend the sushi enough at the Victor. 

The hotel is at the Parc Casino. It's easy to get to via boat, train, and plane. We loved the location, did a lot of walking to all the downtown hot spots but the hotel is still in the heart of downtown. It's right next to the Canucks stadium, if you are interested in a hockey match.

2358,"the DOUGLAS, Autograph Collection",4.3,"This is a review based on a 6 night stay from June 23 to July 5, 2022.

Pros:
-Walking distance close to Creekside Park, the location of the Concord Pacific Dragon Boat festival, which was the main reason for selecting this hotel, which is part of Mariott Bonvoy, allowing me to earn points/free nights.
-Walking distance to Costco and lots of restaurants, shops, etc.  Very tasty and popular gelato place is next door, bakeries closeby, and convenience store across the street.
-Free Kombucha with different flavors, every day upon request.
-Nice and professional check in staff at counter, anyone you meet in the lobby or elevator, etc. 
-Bathroom is beautiful and large.
-High quality expensive shampoo, lotions, etc. in bathroom.
-Nice bathrobes and 2 of them (one in bathroom, one in closet).
-Beautiful, gorgeous,  high quality gym with lots of equipment, space, and views, albeit located at adjacent JW Mariott (go to ""lobby"" on 6th floor, walk across patio area, take elevator up to fitness gym/spa)
-Casino is located b/w Douglas and JW Mariott in the same building, as another form of entertainment.
-Easy to spot this hotel (bronze shiny)! 

Cons:
-Dark throughout hotel. Little lighting. Dark decor in public bathroom, hallways, etc. 
-Room is on small side. 
-My observation:  room with two queen beds seemed larger than room with king bed. (I stayed in room with king bed for 4 nights and room with two queen bed for 2 nights.)  
-No refrigerator in room.
-No microwave in room (this would be nice, but not required; many nice hotels do not have microwave).
-Little counterspace in bathroom.
-No pool, not even a pool at JW Mariott, which shares space.  
-You get charged for a third adult person (according to making reservations on website).",2022-07-23T20:35:25Z,51

2361,"the DOUGLAS, Autograph Collection",4.3,"Since SPG was acquired by Marriott, it's been an abysmal experience for us as former SPG loyalty members. We have not had a great experience with Marriott...until yesterday.

It's not always the physical accommodation that makes a hotel rating five stars. Sometimes it's actually the people working at the hotel. 

This was the case on our most recent stay here at The Douglas in Vancouver BC. Had an issue with our room and Rohit Rana stepped up and made it right in perhaps the most professional and human-like way a person could.

Rohit made everything right and we now have a friend in him. He's a relationship-based leader and that's what makes the difference in business. If I was in the hospitality industry I would immediately steal him away from Marriott...he's that good. Marriott is lucky to have you, my friend. We will surely be back to see you.",2022-05-21T17:38:30Z,51
2362,"the DOUGLAS, Autograph Collection",4.3,"I love this hotel ! Located at the Parq casino, it's one of 2 hotels on premises. 

The theme of the hotel is the Douglas Fir, and you can see this throughout, from the front desk, to the unfinished roofing. 

There is even a ""suggested exercise"" you can do in your room- standing up on a chair, reaching high like a Douglas fir ( something along  those lines ) 
The visuals it brought to mind ! 
 
The front desk staff is excellence! They are polite
and helpful, as expected. 

I loved the bathrooms! The big all glass stand alone shower was awesome. 

While staying here, you can chose from many places to eat. They also have D6 lounge right by the front lobby, which has excellent boozy pop cycles! 

Overall it's a great 4 star hotel. Highly recommend it.",2019-05-05T14:38:43Z,51
2363,"the DOUGLAS, Autograph Collection",4.3,"If you'd like the worst customer service you've ever experienced, stay here. Priced and positioned as a 5 star hotel ($450/night) yet can't help with anything you ask, unprepared on a staffing level for a huge event next door at BC Place (yet had signs throughout the hotel about it), closed all restaurants and bars early, etc etc. I could go on for an hour, I'm so shocked by this experience. Room service: an order of fries & a wine = 1-2 hrs. Uber eats = we can't bring up your food because of provincial laws (??). After a long night this is my nightmare. Stay at the Fairmont.",2023-03-30T08:24:24Z,51
2364,"the DOUGLAS, Autograph Collection",4.3,"I stayed here on a Sunday night with my husband and overall we had an amazing experience! 

Highlights: 
I loved the beautiful and trendy decor/interiors, fantastic front desk customer service, Aesop products in every room (it was heavenly), and espresso machine in each room! The bed was sooo comfortable, the shower/bathroom felt like a mini spa, and i really liked the hotel fitness center! I loved that the location was walkable to many restaurants, shops, and across the street from a bike rental shop. The hotel staff was amazing... 5 stars. I appreciated that they gave us great tips on what to see and do in the area and their kindness felt genuine. 

Cons:
Our room was a few stories above the courtyard/outdoor lounge and both the music and people drinking below got pretty loud at night. Not the worst thing, but something to keep in mind.",2018-08-12T18:53:02Z,51

2366,"the DOUGLAS, Autograph Collection",4.3,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Douglas autograph collection. It's a very unique experience! 

Parking, there are a couple cheap parking option close to hotel which requires reservation. Hotel's parking costs $40 CAD that we didn't use (by accident). We ended up in garage right across from hotel which is $27 CAD but only till 9am. 

The Douglas is connected to Marriott with a casino in between. You can enter through any entrance. If you sign up for membership you can get a small amount of free play at the casino. It's a very clean and possibly smoke free casino. I typically do not like Vegas casino. But I like this one. The hotel is very conveniently located, and also surrounded by nice chocolatier, croissant shop, and gelato shop. 

The hotel is beautifully and classically designed. The elevator is very unique and I will not spoil. The shower can playfully be see through from the room. But also with blinds to cover if you want privacy. 

All toiletries are my favorite Australian brand Aesop. 

This is definitely one of my favorite hotel stay experience!",2020-02-28T07:05:03Z,51

2368,"the DOUGLAS, Autograph Collection",4.3,"I recently stayed at this property for a business-related event and was quite disappointed in the tone and tenor of the actions of the front office over an issue they failed to address in a professional manner and because of that issue it prompts me to author this review. 

The actions of the front office staff was outrageous, rude and just plain condescending and arrogant with the exception of one employee who did assist me after several phone calls after my stay had expired. 

One particular employee was so rude and obnoxious while another employee stood by and did nothing to assist me in what was an obvious error in judgement by the staff in handling my issue. 

Most importantly I never received an apology and that is at the heart of this post. 

As far as location, it is really in the middle of nowhere since there is no Uber access and restaurants and other points of interest are remote and not in walking distance. 

The room lacked a real closet and my toilet needed to be repaired during my stay. 

There is no ice machine on the floor and there are little in choices in terms of snacks or places to dine within the property. 

The casino was truly underwhelming with many transients slinging on the penny slots. The choices of food was terrible (Casino venues) to say the least and I found the property overall extremely disappointing. 

The cost nowhere even came close to any value real or perceived. 

I'm happy to disclose my other concerns if you contact me and will be happy to offer additional information. 

Vancouver is an expensive locale and there are many other better choices in prime locations to get a better flair for this unique community.  

The room's ceiling was never painted or completed and I don't know if that is the feel they are looking for or just a construction oversight.

One good amenity is the quality of television in Canada and the complimentary publications offered in the room.

I do not recommend and would not return.",2018-10-12T00:49:43Z,51
2369,"the DOUGLAS, Autograph Collection",4.3,"We had a very disappointing experience here. Yes, the hotel is trendy and beautifully designed, but the rooms are loud and there was a constant creaking and clanging from the elevator that made noise all day and night. Their manager handled it unfairly and didn't honor a promise to cover our breakfasts and incidentals. When it comes to spending top dollar, customer service should be top notch. This hotel is run by unfriendly corporate pawns who don't honor their promises or care about the people staying with them.

Our room had a loud creaking noise that was clearly coming from the elevators. When we called to ask about it, they couldn't offer us a rate discount because the room had been paid for by a 3rd party site, so they offered to move us to another room that was several floors down. It was so late by the time we'd realized the sound would affect our stay we decided rather than spend the time to pack up and move rooms they offered to cover our breakfasts and incidentals for our 2 night stay. They never checked back in with us and upon checking out we find out they only meant to comp one breakfast for us. Because the manager was different from the night this was arranged they simply said there was ""nothing they could do"".

They had a lot of options. They could have upgraded us to a room that didn't make constant creaking and clanging noises all night and they could have checked in after our first night to see if we were content remaining in our room. We never heard anything until we find out they didn't cover our second day's breakfast, which we wouldn't have ordered had we known it wasn't being covered.

Bottom line, it's a corporate chain that doesn't care about the people who stay with them. They won't honor the good will one employee promised when another employee takes over. We work in Vancouver often and definitely won't stay, or bring our crews, here again.

Our room is right next to BC Place (sports stadium) The hotel itself has a modern take to it. It smells good and it is clean! However, to be listed under 5-Star hotel, I would think there would be an indoor pool or some sort of pool activity. I know there is a fitness room and spa? But was kind of bummed when I didn't see a hotel pool. I was spoiled and ordered breakfast in bed. I ordered two breakfast for myself lol, got the traditional egg Benny and the Chorizo Breakfast Hash. Oh Lordy, the Chorizo Hash stoke the show! It set the bar pretty high, now I don't know if other ""Breakfast in Bed"" food will be just as good as this?! Hotel staff was very nice and attentive. There is a lounge near the lobby. It is swanky af. We were under dressed when we went there, as in we were wearing sporty casual. Cuz we drove from Seattle so we were just dressing comfortably haha! So we only got one drink from the bar and bounce! Although their Cosmopolitan drink was THE bomb! Best I've had!! Again this hotel set the bar on food and drink pretty high up there.

Our room was kept clean our entire stay because of the great job housecleaning did. They folded our clothes and replaced our shoes neatly even though we had kinda just thrown around everything. The hotel provides dental kits, nail filers, pretty much anything and everything you need. Also gave us complimentary Prosecco and chocolate covered strawberries!

The property is designed in a way to make its guests feel like they are in touch with nature by being surrounded with all the Douglas wood accents found in every corner of the hotel and rooms. The staff who work onsite are very professional about addressing guest issues. Our room was a corner suite with a wrap around view (1150) . The bathroom was my favorite part because it faced east and had floor to ceiling windows and the sun would drench the bathroom with natural light in the mornings. I would definitely recommend this hotel to any future guests.,2019-01-14T22:23:22Z,51

The rooms are nicely appointed and all the bathrooms are stocked with Aesop bath products. Note, on the weekend they turn the 6th story hotel bar into a night club that stays open until 3am.  Consequently, I recommend requesting a higher room away from the elevator i.e. 10th floor and above.",2019-01-21T16:44:57Z,51
2376,"the DOUGLAS, Autograph Collection",4.3,"Had a chance to stay at the Douglas and couldn't pass it up. Charming decor inside with a cabin like feel. Our room was a tad small albeit fairly inviting. First thing after checking in, I was surprised to see there's no mini fridge. There are a few things on the desk like a bottle of vodka but there's no ice either. On my floor there was an ice room but inside it sat a lonely mini fridge instead of an ice machine. The fridge itself was empty and there was no ice to be found, I'm genuinely curious what the purpose of this is... Some sort of weird communal fridge?

I also felt that a hotel charging upwards of $250 a night for a single bed ought to include free wi-fi. If you booked your room as one of their rewards members you get this perk but otherwise too bad. 

The kicker for me was the soundproofing. And I'm not trying to be funny and complain about my neighbours having loud relations next door. It's the obnoxious D6 lounge that was just two floors below my room, blasting loud music well into the AM. The lounge itself looks very classy and admission is included with your stay, however I would describe the crowd that frequents D6 with another D word. 

All in all I definitely was not satisfied with my stay at the Douglas. The gym which is on the JW side was very nice but as a whole this experience was unimpressive. If I were an out of town jetlagged visitor and had to deal with the D6 racket I would've certainly asked for a refund.",2018-01-31T08:11:11Z,51

Not knowing Vancouver I didn't realize we'd want to be on the other side of town - not a big deal, but annoying. And with kids you can only get into ONE of the restaurants that isn't connected to the casino. And the Douglas rooms are clearly personalized for adult members including with the snacks/mini bar - a ""sensual kit"" for couples...

The decor selections are intricately chosen perfect for the theme. The bonus but a must are: comfortable luxury bed, sheets, spacious room, lots of free stuff added to the room. You got me to buy Aesop as it is THE most amazing bathroom hand soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash - this kind of hotel should offer... and they did. Customer service exceeded our expectations.

We booked the 2 queen bed room. It was lovely with beautiful comfortable beds, had an umbrella and house coats and slippers.  Also a small gym with heated towels. I requested extra towels for our room as we had 4 in the room. Only downfall is they charge extra for one additional person in a room three people then pay an extra fee. I like the Hollywood/Vegas elevators. The front desk staff were lovely. We were treated well. Many clubs many Resturants it has a Casino attached. 
Coming soon I see Anyti3 Fitness and a Belgian cholclate factory mmm mmm. They also have a shuttle to all sky trains etc.. and Resturants are close by as well. And international village is just steps away. This is a beauty of a place. 
Helpful hint go to Casino and get a players card play some casino games then go register for parking it takes 24 hours for your plates to be registered but then you get Free Parking. So worth it. Also coupons from casino get you discounts at the hotels. Free slot play.

The beds with a fluffy white duvet and four pillows were very comfortable. Our 15th floor room was quiet--no loud guests, housekeepers, or neighbors--as if we had the entire floor to ourselves. The hotel sat a block from the sea wall with a never-ending walking/biking path, a block in the opposite direction to Starbucks for morning coffee, and near Yaletown with restaurants, shops, and Urban Fare (similar to Whole Foods). The Aesop hair and skin care products, free WiFi for Marriott Rewards members, a smart-TV, the illy espresso for an afternoon boost, a gym with new cardio equipment, and a beautiful Casino next door made all the difference. the Douglas aims to capture travelers not needing a kitchen, a mini-refrigerator, a swimming pool, a sofa bed, free breakfast or near tourist attractions.

Great things about the hotel: Appropriate level of service with each encounter, great beds and toiletries which I appreciate. We ran into an unfortunate incident by being woken up to an unruly guest where security had to involve themselves. Could hear rustling in the room. The hotel handled it so appropriately by sending milk and cookies for the kids and a courtesy call. Bonus points for being proactive. They can't control other guests but they do manage very well.

Front desk staff was not able to provide me with an estimated time that my room would be ready and just kept saying my room was on the cue for ""over an hour which is a long time"". Housekeeping was unresponsive to the front desk staff as well as actually cleaning the room. The front desk staff did seem too interested in paying any mind to the guests by greeting or say goodbye to you unless you were paying for their suite (which occurred to the individuals next to me). I had made multiple attempts during my stay to express my disappointment in this trip to the services team, hence now taking my post to Yelp. When it came to concluding my trip, I was locked out of my room and couldn't retrieve my luggage. Once I was able to access my room for my luggage the front desk staff had told me I had 10 minutes to leave the room. Once I hurried out of my room along with my belongings, I then proceeded to carry my luggage across the lobby into the JW Marriott. While walking towards the parking elevator I was then greeted and offered by JW Marriott staff to assist me with my luggage to my car. It was obvious I should've taken my stay next-door.  

Working in customer service and fostering relationships for both premium and general clientele, it's clear to say I know the difference between how a guest should/shouldn't be treated. To say the least after speaking with four different individuals on this matter and nothing to be made of this experience, I find it distasteful for FOUR staff members to blow off their guests. I am writing in hopes to for-worn others and provide the guest staff with a critique that will allow them to learns from their mistakes.

Unbeknownst to me, my boyfriend called the hotel days before our arrival to let them know we are in town celebrating our 3 year anniversary and management left us a nice note and a piece of chocolate cake that tasted phenomenal! Every day our towels were replaced, room cleaned, sheets changed. At check out, even one of the workers outside called three different taxi companies to take us to the airport. We left on the day of Sun Run which we didn't know about until the day before and the roads were closed, limiting taxi/car access to hotels including ours. He advised us to wait at the main road for better opportunity of getting a taxi and when he saw us waiting for a while, he came up to us to accompany us while we waited for a taxi.

And there was also a surprise- a lovely dessert treat to wish us Happy Anniversary along with a handwritten note were delivered to the room just as we got in.  Being a Marriott Gold Elite member, we were able to enjoy the top notch Concierge Room for evening snacks and breakfast. Mario and Bryan there were awesome, and the entire concierge room team worked to ensure each guest saw a bountiful display whenever they entered.  The hotel was in the best location for us to walk around Vancouver, rent a bike to ride on the SeaWall and Stanley Park, take an AquaBoat to Granville Island, and to catch the RapidTransit trains (including easy transit to the airport). I will definitely recommend The Douglas Autograph Collection hotel to my friends who visit Vancouver. GREAT HOTEL EXPERIENCE!!",2018-07-26T20:43:19Z,51
2402,West End Guest House,4.7,"We stayed here from Friday to Monday after a work week and we LOVED it here! I love their concept, vibe, values, and every little details they put in between. Everything done here is done to perfection and you can really tell when you enter their House! Everything was immaculately clean, properly presented and displayed. The house is like a beautiful gallery and museum. You are definitely taken care of very well when you stay here. I would stay here over any 5 stars hotel in a heart beat. Also, you can't beat their location! It is walking distance to everything and all the shoppings!!!  One thing I do want to note is our bed was super soft, up to the point our back hurts from sleeping on their beds for few nights. We are used to firmer mattresses and not sure if it's the type of mattress here or it's old but you will sink in their bed.

Otherwise, overall, thank you so much to the WEGH team, you guys are awesome!!!!!",2023-04-27T22:01:11Z,29
2403,West End Guest House,4.7,"Highly recommend staying with West End Guest House if you are wondering where to stay in Vancouver BC!  Location, immaculate decor and comfortable room, breakfast included, parking included, and the staff are outstanding, friendly people! There's a butler's pantry where they keep tea, coffee, soda and pastries available and are complimentary. A small fridge is also available in the pantry for you to keep your leftovers.

The location is close to shopping and restaurants and close enough to walk to Coal Harbour, English Bay and Stanley Park. About 7 min drive to Granville Market.

I had put in a special request since we were there for my wife's birthday and they surprised her with a rather sizable slice of delicious cake and a birthday card with a handwritten message!

I was a bit hesitant about booking here, at first because of the thought of having other guests in close proximity and being noisy as well as us being too loud. But it was much more peaceful than staying in a hotel. As a matter of fact, we didn't even see the other guests unless it was time for breakfast! It was like we had the whole house to ourselves!

The only concern I would say is that there are stairs to climb so be a aware if you are on the top floor. We were on the top but we didn't mind the exercise especially since there was no gym to use. Also no young children are allowed to stay which is reasonable for this type of place!

Book it! You won't regret it!",2023-03-05T16:34:14Z,29
2404,West End Guest House,4.7,"Perfect for a vacation or staycation! If I had to pick one place to exemplify the best features of an Airbnb, this would be it. From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed like guests into a home. We were given a brief tour of the living room with the fireplace, the complimentary self-serve tea and coffee bar with baked goods, and our room. The 3-course seated breakfast was delicious and a pleasant experience. Because it was Valentine's Day, the hosts decorated the table with hearts, and also gave out free boxes of chocolate to celebrate.  We met quite a few repeat guests who made it a point to stay at West End Guest House whenever they were in town. I would definitely come back!",2020-03-24T19:03:20Z,29
2405,West End Guest House,4.7,"Absolutely wonderful B&B Inn in Vancouver!  The house is decorated beautifully and offers such a warm welcome, particularly at Christmas, with all the lights, tree, garlands and cozy fireplace. 

There's a code for coming and going through the front door, and the staff make sure to give it to you via email prior to your arrival.  They also offer 8 parking spots, included in your stay. This is a wonderful perk for downtown Vancouver.  If you drive in, you can leave your car and walk everywhere because the Inn is centrally located.  But it is also rather quiet, as it is off the main drag in a residential area. 

Our room, #2, was quite spacious and comfortable.  Being on the top floor, we heard no noise from other guests but had to hike a bit with our bags, as there is no elevator. We enjoyed the heated floor in the bathroom and had lots of space to spread out. There's a fire grate in the room, which looked like a functioning fireplace from the pictures online, but it turned out to be decorative.  That was the only minor, minor disappointment. 

The best part of the Inn is breakfast!  Not to be missed!  Barb, the Inn host, is a fantastic cook and baker. She and her friendly staff serve multiple courses, from freshly baked goods to unique fruit presentations to an elaborate savory course finale. There's always plenty of tea, coffee and juice, too. You will not go away hungry. I couldn't believe how wonderful everything was, especially considering the price.  The breakfast is served at 8am on the weekdays and 8:30am on weekends.  Everyone staying at the Inn sits together at a large dining table.  At first, I was worried about it being awkward, but it turned out to be the best part of our stay. We met people from all over the world and had fascinating conversations that lasted long after breakfast was consumed.  I even made a dear new friend from Japan, with whom I know I will keep in touch with for a very long time. 

And as if it could not get any better, later in the evening, Barb puts out a cake for everyone to enjoy at their leisure.  The West End Guest House will leave you feeling spoiled rotten. 

My DH and I love it so much here, we won't hesitate to return every time we stay in Vancouver.",2018-12-09T19:10:23Z,29
2406,West End Guest House,4.7,"My husband were in Van for two days and needed a place to stay overnight. This cute little guest house was in a safe, hip spot of town and much less expensive than surrounding hotels. After booking, they send you a questionnaire with your dietary preferences. Well friends, I'm on a very restrictive autoimmune paleo diet, so I can't have grains (and gluten), dairy, soy, refined sugar, and a ton of other things. I emailed back with a list of what I can't have, but also noted that I don't expect to have major accommodations and can just find breakfast elsewhere. 

Within a day, Barbara (the host) emailed me with clarification. There were a few back and forths, but she said of course she would make something that I can eat. 

When we checked in, the staff also clarified what I could eat. In the morning, it turned out Barbara stayed up late to make me special muffins with honey, free of grain, dairy, soy, and refined sugar. She even made a few for me after breakfast to take with me on my travels. The rest of breakfast was delicious too - the muffin was only one of the courses. We have a savory egg, potato, bacon breakfast and enjoyed meeting the other guests staying at the B&B. 

I am impressed with Barbara's hospitality. I am so used to just not eating when I'm out - but she ensured I could feel like everyone else and leave with a full stomach. 

The room was spotless, quaint, and the bed was super comfortable. I wish we stayed longer! I'll be back and staying here next time we're in town.",2018-09-21T16:53:13Z,29
2407,West End Guest House,4.7,"My wife and I came to the West End Guest house to enjoy a couple days together in Vancouver, and we were very impressed. 

First, we had the third floor, north facing room. King size bed, very nice linens, comfortable seating and a day bed by the window for reading. Very nice full size shower with multiple heads. There was a carafe of water waiting for us in the room along with chocolates. In the main living room downstairs there was a decanter of sherry along with other chocolates available all day. There was a side room with coffee and sodas and baked goods also available all day. The room also had robes and extra pillows for our use. 

Second, the breakfast! Wow. They have a community table set up for all the guests and breakfast is at 8 am sharp. They serve you coffee or tea while seated at the table and bring you fresh fruit, a potato side and different styles of freshly made quiches, we enjoyed a delicious salmon quiche on our last day. Freshly made scones and orange juice also accompanied the meal. 

Third, for those of us who drove in, they had parking in the back of the house. 

All of these items added up together made for an incredible value - just paying for parking and breakfast while staying at another hotel would have easily added $40-60.00 dollars per day. 

We loved it - if you enjoy this style of intimate travel and leisure, I would not hesitate in the least to recommend it.",2015-12-22T18:12:42Z,29
2408,West End Guest House,4.7,"This was an amazing find ! We were celebrating our 25 year wedding anniversary and wanted something special. It was our first time in Canada. When you arrive your welcomed with a warm reception. There is a lovely tour followed by coffee and tea with different daily baked goods available to take to your room! The chef, Barb is an amazing cook. Each morning the breakfast was different and delicious. We were there for the Canada thanksgiving weekend ( we didn't know that till we got there) and because there were not going to be many guests that Monday, she made us her special Thanksgiving breakfast . The night before a guest had a birthday and there was a world famous chocolate cake so good ! The rooms are spacious, comfortable and inviting. The bed is so comfortable ! It's within walking distance to many attractions. The staff are kind, funny and hospitable. If your looking for a getaway or celebrations this is the place for you! We will be back !",2019-10-13T21:08:22Z,29
2409,West End Guest House,4.7,"Very warm welcome at the West End Guest House and it got better still. A nice quiet room and a relaxing common area made for a nice capper on our great day in Vancouver. 
The free parking made it nice to leave the car and find our way around via Skytrain , Aquabus , and feets. You should stay here if you dig B&Bs . (Perhaps even if you are not sure how you feel about them)",2015-04-12T04:54:45Z,29
2410,West End Guest House,4.7,"What a gem of a bed and breakfast. It masters the art of feeling old while not being ""old"". They've somehow retained all the charm of a Victorian style home from a bygone era but clearly have restored the place with modern upgrades. The furniture feels antique but also restored and well taken care of. Modern upgrades like USB wall outlets and rain shower heads are blended in with the beautiful details you'd expect in an classic home. The people that work here are great too. I've only interacted extensively with Barbara and Martin and they're both very helpful people. Martin is a nice guy happy to chat with me, which is really important for the solo traveler. Barbara is a great cook. The little things are really what makes this place great. Like the sheets being perfectly clean and spotless (a pet peeve of mind in chain hotels), the quality of the bedding is top notch. The nice spread of fresh water with classy glasses in your room, the free sherry waiting for you in the parlor any time of day or night, refreshments and coffee any time downstairs. The well appointed bathrooms with great products. The parlor room is so comfortable I could sit in there for hours reading. It really feels like home, just more comfortable and charming.

Finally the famous breakfasts here are a sight to see. It tastes home made because it is! The food is better than anything you would get at a hotel. It's like waking up at home to a freshly cooked breakfast at your table. The best part is talking to folks from all over the world at your table. We talked for two hours the first morning. None of this happens in a hotel. I hope I can get back to Vancouver again and I already know where I will be staying!",2016-10-17T07:55:24Z,29
2411,West End Guest House,4.7,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay here at the West End Guest House for Valentine's Day weekend. Cute house with lots of Victorian charm! I like how they provide free off-street parking, so we don't have to deal with finding a spot on the street or even paying for one at most hotels.

We stayed in the deluxe queen room on the top floor. The bed was very comfortable, and I couldn't get over how soft the sheets were! It literally felt like I was sleeping on clouds. We had our own private bathroom, and it was clean and well-stocked with the usual amenities (shampoo/conditioner, soap, hair dryer, Q-tips, makeup remover towelettes). There was also water provided for us in a carafe with 2 fancy glasses on top of the dresser. Talk about attention to detail...I was impressed!

There is a laminated information booklet that provides information about checkout times, when to get up for breakfast (8:30am on weekends and 8am on weekdays), things to do, as well as the history of the house itself. I e-mailed one of the owners on how to borrow their free bikes during our stay, but unfortunately he said that they no longer offer that service.

The free Wi-Fi was a little spotty with our cell phones, but it worked fine on my laptop. They also provide free sherry, as well as complimentary snacks and beverages downstairs.

The complimentary breakfast here is amazing! What happens is all the guests would sit down at the fancy dining table, and get served several delicious gourmet courses including beverages. That alone is enough for me to wake up early for it!

Our room was cleaned while we were out, so we were happily surprised to return to a nice, clean room in the evening.

In terms of making reservations, there are a limited number of rooms in the guest house so it would be wise to book ahead. I appreciate how the staff worked hard to accommodate us and keep us comfortable throughout our stay, and any concerns that we had were addressed including the Wi-Fi situation. I would not hesitate to stay here again on our future visits to Vancouver!",2016-02-28T21:14:03Z,29
2412,West End Guest House,4.7,"Stay here only if you desire warm hospitality, a comfortable room, great location and beautiful surroundings. 

This exquisitely decorated Victorian house is just a few blocks both Stanley Park and the bustling shopping and entertainment streets of downtown Vancouver. Great dining, movies, live theater and the outdoors are all a short walk from ""home"".

The day starts with a delectable breakfast from a professional chef. There is one grand dining table so all visitors dine together. Conversation is pleasant and easy with guests from around the world. I would choose this place just for the experience of sharing a daily meal with so many kind and interesting travelers.

The entire house is filled with original artwork collected by the proprietors. We never got tired of looking at the eclectic assortment of paintings and collectibles. The furniture is comfortable and we spent many hours relaxing in the living room, enjoying complimentary coffee, tea and snacks. Other guests would stop by and chat as they went to and from their activities; the other guests seemed to be instant friends which made staying here even more special.

I was quite pleased with our room which had a kitchenette, private bath and two beds. Our bath had top-quality towels and amenities. All my expectations were met.

Every guest we encountered raved about this B&B and we agree. I would HIGHLY recommend this B&B over a 4-star hotel. The accommodations are comparable to a high end hotel but the warm hospitality, congeniality of guests, 5-star breakfast and great location put it above any area hotel in my opinion. You should stay here if you can get a reservation.",2015-10-18T00:18:04Z,29
2413,West End Guest House,4.7,"In order to accommodate my unplanned, last-minute, two-night stay at West End Guest House, I spent one night in the Superior King Garden Suite and the other in Small Single Room.  Both rooms were lovely and comfortable in their own special way, fully equipped for all one's needs.  Beautiful shared spaces: parlor with fireplace, front porch, back garden, sundeck.

Breakfasts are family style, everyone eats at the same time.  Unfortunately, I missed both breakfasts:  salmon soufflé and eggs benedict.  After the second missed breakfast, lovely, spectacular, competent Barbara fed me the best baked apple ever, provided a hot pot of coffee and allowed me some much needed space in the quaint back garden to gather my thoughts and feelings before heading home with my father's ashes.

They offer free wi-fi, complimentary refreshments and sherry, free off-street parking.  Convenient downtown location is near all the good stuff:  restaurants, shopping, Stanley Park, Convention Center and Skytrain transport to/from airport.",2016-10-19T23:16:08Z,29
2414,West End Guest House,4.7,"Great service, comfortable stay, perfect location...and the staff is top-notch!

Busy all year round so book early.",2016-08-01T18:58:16Z,29
2415,West End Guest House,4.7,"A picturesque Victorian house between taller, multi-tenant dwellings on a tree lined street.  Location is convenient with most things-to-do within walking distance.

On the surface, this is a well appointed B&B with common areas:  dining (where guests gather for an 8ish sit down bfast,) a parlor, and front porch. Global guests come & go.  

Although our king suite was spacious and included a fenced patio, the accommodations did not meet our expectations.  

#8 is a private entry down a few stairs under ground level, behind the house and under the main floor kitchen & back porch (noise.)   En suite, a kitchenette, dinette & sofa are in place.  Clean and somewhat cozy.  The washroom/shower, although sufficient, is quite small with a very low ceiling entry.  The lighting & blackout shades are a nice touch.

The lack of a/c and 100% poly sheets were no match for the warmer temps, even with an oscillating fan.  We did not sleep well.  Opening windows is not an option due to unsecured access from the alley & then there are the full window blinds.

Barbara & Paul are kind, gracious hosts/staff.  Olive, the on-premise pooch, is a love.

Considering this B&B, at the price point we paid, as a value, probably not.  Taking into account location, possibly, to some, a value.   Seeing the nearby Safeway going bye-bye for redevelopment, the times here, they are a changing.",2017-08-31T04:47:05Z,29
2416,West End Guest House,4.7,"I recently stayed at the West End Guest House in Vancouver.  I have been very fortunate lately with my selection of B&Bs, since lately I have found the insides of a hotel to be at times impersonal.  Upon arrival I notice the grounds and garden are kept in immaculate condition and the guest house inside takes you back in time to the turn of the century.  The last century of course.

Since I was travelling alone, I reserved a room in their cozy double.  The room has a double size bed and a small private bath w/ walk-in shower.  The bathroom has a hairdryer, shampoo and soap.  This cozy room is the right size for 1 person.  With 2 people, it becomes cramped quickly.

There is a communal kitchen with a refrigerator holding bottle water, sodas and juice.  Also there are homemade baked goods served daily in a glass cake holder.  While there, they served banana bread (delish!).  Another great plus is the complimentary gourmet breakfast served to all guests in the morning.  My breakfast was a breakfast burrito on a whole wheat tortilla served with fresh fruit.  A nice way to start the day!

For internet access, there is a wireless internet station in the hallway.  Should you bring your laptop, there is a Starbucks on Robson Street about 1 block away that offers wireless internet for a fee.

Evan, the proprietor, is very friendly and helpful in meeting your needs during your stay.  Whenever I can, I always try to find a smaller hotel or a bed & breakfast which takes the edge off of traveling making you feel more at home.  For great hospitality and great value, the West End Guest House is your place!",2009-02-12T03:25:51Z,29
2417,West End Guest House,4.7,"Seriously, they need to add at least three more stars before I could even come close to doing this review the proper way, but since reality exists I will just say that the west end guest house goes above and beyond expectations. 
The rooms are very reasonably priced for the amount of luxury and history that you feel when you stay in them, the service is relaxed and consistent, full delicious breakfasts that leave you full of energy to scope out all of downtown and its parks and life, it seems to be right in the hub, easy to access busses and cabs but not around any noise or traffic. 
I never felt more at home. 
P.S...featherbed in the deluxe queen, among the fact that it was beyond gorgeous. See you in the summertime!!!",2010-12-30T18:02:10Z,29
2418,West End Guest House,4.7,"Our two-night visit to the West End Guest House amounted to to the most enjoyable, entirely perfect lodgings I have had the pleasure of staying in anywhere. I was very sorry to see Sunday arrive, knowing we would have to vacate our cozy queen bedroom! 

The proprietors, Evan and Ron, put a great deal of thought into designing a B&B that caters to your every need and comfort, and it clearly shows. From the pristine place settings at the breakfast table and the fresh baked goods available at all hours of the day, to the bottle of water in your room and the plush bed, every detail is attended to. It makes the West End Guest House feel like a truly luxurious yet unpretentious second home. The beautiful old Victorian home (mansion?!) has been updated with new bathrooms, flat-screen TV's, and mini ""fireplaces"" in each room. There is a downstairs DVD library with all sorts of great movies for borrowing.

The location is fantastic, just a block off of the bustling Robson Street within easy walking distance of a multitude of fantastic restaurants and shopping, yet set far enough off the main drag that it is very quiet at night.  

The breakfast here is served at the table, in several mouth-watering courses. On the morning we were able to make it to breakfast, we enjoyed fresh baked muffins, fruit with yogurt, fresh juice, coffee, and a smoothie, and a main course of either vegetarian or prosciutto frittata. We also enjoyed our conversation with other guests over breakfast. The second morning, we had to leave very early as my boyfriend was running in a half marathon across town. They put out a continental breakfast for us to nibble on before we left, as well as packing him a brown bag snack that included a delicious peanut butter, banana, and strawberry sandwich with fruit and granola bars. So thoughtful!

We took advantage of their free loaner bikes to do a lovely Saturday morning bike ride around Stanley Park (which I highly recommend visiting during your time in Vancouver!), an easy ~8 mile loop. I also brought my bike from home, and they kindly let me store it in the locked storage room with the other bikes, where I was able to access it anytime but it was safe and dry. 

Unlike most hotels in the area, West End Guest House offers free off-street parking for guests. Combined with the delicious hot breakfast and all the little ""extras,"" West End Guest House is worth every penny. I can't imagine staying anywhere else next time I'm in Vancouver.

**Just a tip if you're making online reservations through a website like Booking.com: there is another B&B in the U.K. that shares the same name, so make sure you have the Vancouver location! (Our friends unfortunately made this mistake and didn't discover it until the night before their trip... oops!)",2012-02-18T22:09:53Z,29
2419,West End Guest House,4.7,"We had a wonderful stay at this bed and breakfast. The breakfasts were amazing. Evan, the proprietor, is very hospitable, friendly and knowledgeable about the area. The room was extremely comfortable and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

Hotels can make one feel like a number or a ""customer"" - this bed and breakfast makes you feel as if you're visiting friends.  We highly recommend this place for anyone who wants to feel like they are home.",2013-09-29T16:52:27Z,29
2420,West End Guest House,4.7,"Absolutely the cutest Bed & Breakfast I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. We arrived on a rainy evening and Barb wasted no time in showing us to our homey accommodations in the Superior King Garden Suite. The suite was spacious, clean and the decor was chic. This B&B is conveniently located to great eateries and shopping. If the weather permits, leave your car at West End and enjoy a stroll around the neighborhood. This review would not be complete if I did not tell you about breakfast. In the morning the West End guests are invited to eat family style in the formal dining room. Breakfast is an experience not to be missed [and if you are planning on missing it, please kindly let Barb know]. Every morning Barb whips up a delicious menu that will keep you full until dinner. The morning we spent with Barb included sherry soaked fig scones with cinnamon butter and eggs benedict with a vegetable medley. The hospitality and care at West End rivals that of top tier hotel experiences. My husband and I cannot wait to return.",2018-04-29T08:11:22Z,29

Our room was very clean and comfortable.  The lounge was very inviting with a fireplace and a wonderful place to relax sipping the Sherry available.  The Butler's Pantry was stocked with soft drinks, teas, and muffins and cookies.  The breakfast was substantial and there was great conversation amongst the guests.  It is situated within walking distance to English Bay and Stanley Park with it's aquarium.  There are many restaurants in the area offering various cuisines.

The gourmet breakfasts were just delicious, particularly the crab benedict.  The furnishings were delightfully Victorian, but not over the top.  Everything was spic and span.  We borrowed the guest bikes to ride around Stanley Park which is nearby.  Vancouver was having a heat wave and our attic room did get a bit hot, but you can't hold the owners responsible for that.  Outside deck, afternoon sherry and cookies.....We would stay there again in a heartbeat, a great Inn in a great city.",2013-08-18T01:11:48Z,29
2424,West End Guest House,4.7,"I wish I would have read all of the reviews herein before I beat my brain up by visiting all of the other B & B review sites, in Vancouver.  They are all spot on for the West End Guest House.  You should read them all so I don't have to touch on all matters.  As of this writing, all reviews are 5 star and deservedly so.  We always try to stay in B & Bs, when traveling, rather than large impersonal hotels.  The West End Guest House (WEGH) is one of our favorites.
Admittedly, the house does not have sweeping panoramic vistas of Vancouver's sights but when ALL of those sights are a 15~20 minute walk in any direction, that more than makes up for it.  It is very central.  International restaurants, shops, transportation, parks, events are all very close and yet not so close that their concomitant noise impinges on the serentity of the setting.
One facet requires special mention.  Despite WEGH being a very historic building, Evan and Ron have avoided the pitfalls that destroy the charm of many older places that have been renovated.  The upgrades and inclusions of modern facilities and devices never intrude on the senses in a way that lessens the experience.  The charm of the house remains in full force.  Their decision to include individual bathrooms was appreciated.  Their 23 years of experience hosting travelers here shines brightly. 
We stayed there 5 days and would gladly have stayed longer if our schedule would have allowed it.  Evan and Ron are both consummate hosts and chefs.  One never feels out of place.  You always feel welcome.  It is our ""go to"" place in Vancouver now.  My only fear is that, as the word gets out, it will become harder and harder for us to get reservations there.",2014-03-23T23:48:49Z,29

2428,West End Guest House,4.7,"My husband and I are so glad we chose the West End Guest House for our three night stay in Vancouver, British Columbia January 22, 2014.

The hosts, Evan and Ron, were friendly and helpful. While never intrusive, they were always available to share their knowledge of the West End area and made sure our stay was perfect. They have created a truly special place to stay, with spacious rooms that are comfortable, quiet, immaculately clean and impressively appointed. One of the highlights of our stay was Evan making a delicious breakfast for us. Something different every morning, always delicious with way too much to eat, but we did.

The guest house has so many complimentary amenities that made our stay exceptionally comfortable: There is a diverse library of books and movies, a pantry stocked with beverages, WI-fi and a guest computer, Sherry in the evening, bikes available and cookies before bedtime.

The Guest House is in an excellent location close to Stanley Park, downtown Vancouver, art galleries and a great variety of wonderful restaurants and shops, all within walking distance. The free off-street parking is a real benefit.

West End Guest House will definitely be our choice to stay the next time we visit Vancouver, British Columbia.",2014-02-07T00:30:21Z,29

There's no parking. There's two floors and they have personalized items (bags, fragrance, etc)

The staff here was welcoming and greeted me right when I entered. The lady provided me sparkling water while she was helping me look for belts

A gentlemen and lady helped wrapped my gift and also introduced me to their personalized cologne section. I'm glad I came here as I was a bit intimidated but they made me felt welcomed. 

They wrapped the gift bag in  another plastic bag so  the bag doesn't get wet from the rain, very considerate and also gave perfume samples 

Definitely would come back to the store due to a wonderful experience from the staff.",2020-01-24T00:23:00Z,56

Everything has been sold out online and in stores for months! They finally had the purse I've been searching for.

2433,Louis Vuitton Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Omg just met the kindest and nicest SA i have ever met in my whole life especially LV. I would to recommend Lily compared to all of the other staff. Lily is such an amazing SA. She is very helpful and make things got easy and interesting. She is beyond top tier. If you come here, make sure to find Lily instead of the others. Ohh I saw one SA who was just starring at me just and didnt respect my area there and thinking im poor. Bruh i can probably buy your mom go buy a mirror!!! On the other hand, Lily who was very nice and did not even discriminate by the way i look. Just because someone who would wear t shirt and short pants dont mean they cant buy LV bozooo. Ohh i dont wear them though. But these people probably can buy the whole store just saying. Look at Lily she worked there for a year and she was super friendly and did not judge me and felt shes the manager and the experience onr. I can vouch for Lily and please take my the feedback for her. Find Lily guys!! Thank you Lily for making my visit wonderful! Cheers!!",2022-01-15T02:44:13Z,56
2434,Louis Vuitton Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Came in here to purchase the LV Neverfull in Damier Azur MM pink. I knew exactly what I wanted when I went into the store, so I was looking for an associate/ sales rep to help me out. After a few minute of standing around a nice sales rep came to help. She told me that they didn't have the pink Damier azur MM that I wanted in stores, but she took out two neverfulls MM and GM for me to compare the size. She said I could order it in-store and just have the one I wanted shipped directly to my house when the shipment came in. So I decided to do that. 

I was then transferred to another associate called Dora to finish the purchase, payment and personal information. I doubled check with Dora to make sure that it was the PINK interior, and she said it was. I was given my receipt and went home, super excited for my bag to arrive! 

Two days later (Friday), Dora texts me to let me know that the bag has shipped from the store. The following Tuesday, I received the package. It was beautifully wrapped in the LV orange package with a red bow. I opened it super excited and was super super disappointed. The interior of the bag was the neutral tan colour. (The whole reason why I wanted it was for the pink interior). So I was really annoyed... because it's LV... people pay a lot of money for the bag... but I didn't even receive the correct bag. 

I then texted Dora, and she told me to go back IN STORES and she will switch my bag for me. So I went in... had to pay for parking downtown... and when I saw Dora, she didn't even acknowledge me until I told her I was there for the bag. She then told another associate to go upstairs to get the pink bag, and another associate did the exchange for me. Dora didn't even personally help or apologize for her mistake. 

Later I asked the associate how the mistake was made, and she said ""it could have been a human or computer error"" like she didn't want to admit there was a mistake. But when I looked at the receipt, I saw right away... my new receipt said Rose Ballerina (pink) but the old receipt didn't. So I'm positive that Dora was the one who made the mistake. Which really bothers me because I double checked with her too! 

Anyways, all in all, this review is mainly based on Dora and her lack of customer service. She paid attention to another customer when I went in for the return... because she wouldn't be getting any commission from me (since i already purchased it) but with the other customer she would. HIGHLY disappointed. but I do love my bag!",2019-04-12T20:28:20Z,56

Both times the store was inadequately staffed, without even a greeting when we walked in, much less anyone who was free to assist us. The first time we browsed for half an hour and since no one was able to help us, we decided to leave. Today we already knew exactly what we wanted and just went in for a quick purchase but again couldn't find anyone to take the bag for us and ring it up. We waited for 20 minutes and left.

This was the worst experience I've had at LV across the globe. Even in other busy locations, there was at least acknowledgement that someone will come to assist soon.  We were ignored through and through - this is unbecoming of LV's commitment to their customer.",2019-07-01T03:06:37Z,56

I thought it was just a bad day but every time I came back she was just rude and all the associates.

minutes of our arrival, we had, not one but TWO sales attendants following us around.  We asked to see women's shoes and were directed upstairs and followed at a distance of about three feet.  No one tried to sell us anything, no one offered help, they just stood and watched.  When I asked one of the attendants if it was customary for sales reps to follow customers around the store, she said ""YES!""

Why you ask? Because every single time I have ever visited this location, I have been greeted politely, not ignored just based on how I look or dress (ahem, holt LV). I have purchased a few things through my SA Fiona who is the best! She responds to my text messages no matter how trivial my questions are, helped me order stuff online when it wasn't available in store, fixed a problem with my new 6key holder that holt LV refused to fix, and always tries to find the exact thing I need!

I bought my very first LV at the age of 18 (25 years later) and its still in amazing condition.  It just shows the quality and workmanship of LV products. 

I was given an Epi wallet as a gift, I already had one similar so I returned it.  Even though it was a return they treated me like I was buying something, smiling at me the entire time.

2451,Louis Vuitton Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Terrible, frustrating experience at this location. Went the first time to get shades for me and bf. Given its Covid times, I understood there would be waiting involved. We got there, paid for parking and were told it would be an hour and 45 mins wait, we decided to wait in line incase we could go in sooner. We were able to get in after 45 mins wait. Hand sanitizing and masks are mandatory for everyone, which was awesome (they hand out masks at the door). We knew exactly what we wanted and were greeted and helped right away. We were done in 10mins. Once home, bf realized he didn't like his shades as much and would like to exchange. So, trying to avoid the wait again, I went online and booked an appt for a week and a half later (earliest available). 

Second visit, we expected to not wait again at the door and be done in short time. We were put in a separate line since we made an appt, and yet had to wait AN HOUR again. It was super frustrating, they kept taking other customers in, who may have walked in and waited for their turn. What is the point of making an appointment if we still have to wait even more than we waited when we walked in the previous time? They said, your rep is just finishing with a customer and will get you soon. After 30 mins of wait, I asked how much longer it would be, then they gave me the reply about Covid and Regulations... I said I completely agree with that and glad that you are following the rules about Max # of customers in store. But why do i have to wait 30 mins after making an appt a week and half in advance. I don't care which rep helps me, when I booked the appt. i didn't book with a particular rep nor did it say online that you would still have to wait even if you book an appt.

We ended up getting a refund and getting out of there. Its not worth to give them our business when they don't care about customer service.",2020-07-16T03:08:04Z,56

First I talked with a guy  and he said he gotta call someone to doubel check ...then a lady came and she said ""SORRY WE CAN'T RESELL THIS ITEM TO SOMEONE ELSE SO YOU CAN'T REFUND IT.""

The service is always top notch (except for once last summer but management had dealt with that). My preference is to shop here just before dinner time as the service is better since there is less of a crowd.

The store has also recently done an excellent job at organizing the bags by placing the exotics bags upstairs for those of us looking for the speciality items in private. I went in to find my birthday gift, a lovely ostrich bag! Excellent service with tea and a treat. The only recommendation I have is for the scarves, the stock should be regularly monitored as everytime I got to purchase one, the style I like can't be sold to me because it has some sort of defect so I have to wait for them to have it ordered for me.

2460,Louis Vuitton Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"I walked into this Louis Vuitton store on Burrard street and received patient service in helping me to select a bag. When I was on the fence of getting a smaller bag or a slightly larger one, the SA emphasized their 14-day return / 30-day exchange policy, assuring that I could always come back to get the other one should I found the one I bought not completely satisfactory. I took out my credit card and sealed the deal.

Three days later I did return to this store for an exchange of a bigger bag. This time I received very different service. Another SA served me and I don't know if it was because she couldn't get commission off an exchange, she seemed to be in a big hurry, took a bag from a drawer, handed it to me, left me less than 10 seconds for inspection and asked impatiently, ""OK??"", waiting to complete the exchange and send me off.  Come on, I was getting a thousand dollar bag that I would hang on to for years, shouldn't I deserve at least a minute or two (or even as long as it takes) to make sure I'm getting something flawless? 

Another SA showed the same attitude too, when I was pointing out the uneven stitching on the first bag, he quickly grabbed the bag off my hands and said to his coworker in a sarcastic tone, ""Give her another bag, she doesn't like this one."" I took the second bag, paid the difference and left. The whole  exchange lasted for around five minutes.

Interesting that I happened to run across this forum discussion about how LV treats its customers after sale: http://www.complaints.com/directory/2006/july/14/16.htm. So think twice before you commit to buy.

It seems to be their corporate culture that LV (- at least in this location) only cares about taking money from you, and once it's done, they're also done with you.",2012-02-28T03:41:08Z,56

Now, this was from a 2 year old item that I originally bought when I lived in LA so it took them some research to finally figure out which item exactly they need to order. Service was very professional the entire time though which encouraged me to also get some other things like two very useful passport covers (one for each PP) and an iPhone sleeve.

What I like about the recent designs is, that you have many options now aside from the usual monogram style which (at least for men) is a bit 'too much on the eye' if you know what I mean.

Why 5 stars? Well... I went to 2 other Flagship stores and the service there was dismal to say the least. Not so at this location and I was very satisfied with the service.

At this designer level status, one expect good quality but it's the name that counts, and LV sure knows what they're doing.

I can say that their decor, several seating areas, esp. in the men's section, is approved.  Plus a real, dedicated men's section for clothing and the 'murses' is a classy touch too, and not just an after-thought.

Service, though, I would best describe as stoic, almost robot-like.  Maybe it's not a hard sell and sells by itself, but I personally want some more pizzazz, as I didn't feel that lol.

They do great repairs here. My friend's purse strap broke and they replace it for a small fee, but when it broke again due to a faulty clasp, they replace it for free.

Only down side is the tours of tourist that storm the store like its Black Friday.. Really rude and annoying.",2014-03-02T21:12:53Z,56
2471,Louis Vuitton Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Having had some experience shopping for (and selling) higher-end luxury goods, I was pleasantly surprised by the relative friendliness of this sleek and elegant location. LV has an aura around it, of massively over-priced coated canvas goods with a universally revered name, and hence you expect a certain level of service when you walk in one of their stores. I did not get that here. Although they weren't exactly falling over themselves in a rush to help and engage, the associates were friendly and welcoming in an aloof way. They were attentive when necessary, and kept their distance the rest of time. I knew I could approach them if I had questions.

As for the store itself, it is laid out well - tasteful displays, clean and organized. They even have some rare collectible display pieces not for sale; a huge, battered box the sign designated as a hatbox, meant for six ladies' hats, dating from 1907. Very cool. I would never buy a piece from here, but it is certainly a fun excursion if you're aimlessly wandering around downtown Vancouver.

2472,Louis Vuitton Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"Yes I am a self proclaimed Louis V addict. I have been frequenting this location weekly for a few years, not only because of the product but the service...ask for Monika D - she will always make sure you are taken care of with no pressure.

Shoes, sunglasses, luggage I always can find a reason to keep buying Louis, and with last years extensive renovation, the ready to wear just means more shopping.

See you at the bag bar!",2011-05-06T03:28:31Z,56
2473,Louis Vuitton Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"I love the newly renovated LV. Two levels, lots of designer dreams can be made accessories.
Check out their shoes, the clothes and of course the bags.
We did alot of ooooohin and ahhhing.  
And did you know that they latest stuff from LV for Vancouver are here?

One thing to note is that some of the stuff here is actually priced better the the boutique in Holt Renfrews!!!  No way?  Yes way. Although the staff member at Holts refused to believe us  a clutcth purse for $615 at Burrard is cheaper than the same for $650 at Holts.  Yes Way!!!!

That Chinese shrewdness for looking  for the deals seems to have won here.
Did we buy anything? Nope. And that was a nice thing.  To dream and work towards that for the next time.  It's always better to be earned than to have just received.

And Besides, the Infinity is taking up those bills so we look good getting there to the store to window shop. One day, we'll come in and toss the cash around and just buy buy buy!",2010-12-15T06:42:19Z,56
2474,Louis Vuitton Hotel Vancouver,3.5,Seems like they fixed a lot of the problems I stated with my previous review. A employee now greeted me within 5 minutes of entering the store and asked if I wanted some water while I was waiting for a sales associate to finish up with another customer.

I have been to this location on several occasions for example: high tea, private shopping events, and just my drop by to indulge. I love the management at this particular location because she is very down to earth, every time I see her I get greeted with a warm hug (so sweet). Some of the workers are awful and rude , however not all of them. They know me by name which is nice as I get acknowledged every time I walk into the store. I give LV at the Hotel Vancouver 4 stars because of some of the rude mediocre workers, otherwise it would have been 5 stars.

Having said that, the ""rep"" at the sunglasses counter did an outstanding job. I just walked in, he was right there asking me how I was, what I was interested in, and did a great job. He even had people come in as I was paying/leaving and told them he would be right with them.

Awesome service. Nice store too.",2015-02-10T05:54:26Z,56

I was not greeted, they were standing behind the till chatting and stared at me like a deer once I wandered in.  The securities even said HI before any of the ladies did.  They had what I wanted to buy that Holts ran out, but I'll go back to Holts and see if they can get the item in.  That service is just ridiculous if I have to hunt you down and inquire about a product and you tell me I should have called instead, when I clearly explained I was in the area...I know you want a sale, but don't make it so obvious.",2011-08-10T07:38:09Z,56
2479,Louis Vuitton Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"was walking down the street today and I stopped dead in my tracks in front of the Louis Vuitton windows on Burrard.  

I know, I know.. your saying but those are produced a corporate level and they send the same old display to every store nationally and internationally.  These however were pretty funny, the first thing that popped into my head was ""no one better lay a finger on my Buttefinger""

Perfectly perched on a yellow plynth was a beautiful example of the leather bags they offer and surrounding this bag was about 30 perfectly polished silver security camera's all focused on the bag...

2480,Louis Vuitton Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"I've always admired Louis Vuitton. From the first time my dad bought my mom a lv purse I knew it was special! 

The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the Holt renfrew customer service is absolutely superb! I heard different before but the many times that I've just gone to look at stuff, they were more than happy to let me touch everything! 

Back to the Burrard st store. When I got there, it was pretty busy. It looked like every salesperson was helping someone already. Knew what I wanted but decided to give a store a go around just to make sure I saw everything but before I could make it quarter way through the store somebody was ready to help me. 

Service was great. Showed me a bunch of other bags, gave me her recommendations, rang me up and set me on my way! 

Store definitely isn't as glamorous as the others that I have been to but definitely not one bit snobby (as some people expect) which makes me happy. 

Even if I didn't buy anything I would have rated it just as high because walking into LV and even just looking is such a fun experience.. being able to look and touch all the bags, trying on their shoes and jewellery... a girls dream! (well, mine atleast!)",2009-06-16T17:28:58Z,56
2481,Louis Vuitton Hotel Vancouver,3.5,I have to say when you don't usually shop luxury brands but want a special experience this store has you covered. Their customer service is superior and they will help you make the decision if you are caught between two products.

2482,Louis Vuitton Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"The funny thing is that I don't look like someone who can afford let alone own an LV bag, yet I have a few designer pieces in my closet 'cause let's face it, I am a girl. My experience in here was horrible. They just might as well have said it that I wasn't even worthy of walking in the store. The ring and bag I was looking at was more expensive than what I later got in Beverly Hills on my CA vacation. I wanted at the time to put in some local CND $$, however, the bag was more expensive than their CA store (in a very expensive district). I can understand on R - Drive not being given the time of day but seriously in Vancouver? I wasn't even dressed nice on holiday: Leather jacket, Iron Maiden shirt and yellow spikish hair. In Vancouver I wore: Nice blouse, dress jeans, yellow hair and a bow, however, my clothes were from Metrotown and cost less than $20 for the entire outfit (I came from work). Lesson learned to spend yet again my hard earned dollars in the US 'cause clearly the CND market doesn't want it.",2013-05-14T18:33:01Z,56
2483,Louis Vuitton Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"I prefer this store over the LV in Holt Renfrew. Better layout, better selection, better stock, and I don't feel like the staff judges me if I walk in with sweats on;...

But I have to say that I was very displeased with the service I received during my last visit there.

I already knew exactly what I wanted before I walked in the store - speedy 35 in azur. So I walked into the store, no browsing and bee-lined it to the counter in the back with the purses. Took a while to get a sales associate to help me. I got a hold of a younger Asian female associate and asked her if they had the speedy 35 in azur in stock. She said she wasn't sure and recommended some seasonal speedies/speedy's in vibrant colours. Normally I would have been intrigued by this but today was different. It was Chistmas eve and I was already exhausted from Christmas shopping. All I wanted to do was to pick up the purse that I had already decided on after hours of contemplation online. I told her that I was only interested in the azur. She then told me that she wasn't sure if they had it. Fair enough; Christmas time is probably one of their busiest seasons. My friend whom I was with at the time was also becoming impatient with this SA and asked her to look the the drawers under the displayed purses. Sure enough there were a few of the exact models I was looking for. She didn't even check before dismissing my request. I paid and I was out of there. 

I left the store feeling that the SA that I dealt with was I knowledgable and careless. It might have been due to the fact that I was already short on patience from last minute Christmas shopping earlier, but I left feeling frustrated at the fact that had my friend and I had not been a little pushy, we may not have walked out with what I walked in wanting in the first place.",2014-06-26T05:06:48Z,56
2484,Louis Vuitton Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"I had issues with a LV bracelet that I bought in Hawaii, therefore, I took the bracelet back to the LV store on Burrard.  The staff that assisted me, from the Manager Qialing Jiang to the sales associate Paul  where so pleasant and helpful.  They gave me options of whether I wanted another bracelet or a gift card.  I totally appreciated their time and effort to assist me.  It's reassuring to know that when luxurious items are purchased although at a different LV store, the customer is treated so well when issues arise.  I will be recommending that store to my family and friends and will definitely return for my future purchases.  Thanks for the great service.",2015-01-20T01:15:11Z,56
2485,Louis Vuitton Hotel Vancouver,3.5,"I have purchased three handbags since Feb. Two in Maui at the Whalers Village store and one at the Burrard Location. I actually exchanged this bag twice which is very unusual for me. I just couldn't decide. However , I did spend more each time. Part of my dilemma was the staff were no where near as helpful as other locations I've shopped in . I've always felt like I was being rushed. When I went in the last time to make my second and finale exchange, the salesgirl Heidi , actually looked at me and said, "" This is the second bag you've returned, I believe ""   She actually said it in a very nasty voice! I was shocked and finally replied that her remark was completely inappropriate ! She quietly and begrudgingly apologized. They were aware this was my third purchase in five months. This rude young woman forgets which side of the counter she is stands. This type of behavior is something you would never experience in any other store downtown. It is, sadly, typical of some misguided staff at Louis Vuitton stores who somehow believe that by working there as staff ,their social standing has been elevated.

2487,Hotel Belmont,3.6,"I'm not sure if Hotel Belmont Vancouver had any ties to the now closed ""Belmont Hotel"" in Dallas, Texas, but they have a lot in common that I liked. 

I stayed at Hotel Belmont in Vancouver, BC for a two-night work trip, so I didn't get to check out all of the ammenties, but here's what I liked: it's a boutique hotel with a lot of character; it's bold, it's playful (as seen in the shower floor tile that spells out ""no diving"")... 

The hotel has an onsite restaurant/bar ""the living room,"" one lounge ""the basement"" opened Friday and Saturday nights until 3am... but no gym. During my stay, I was givine a free drink token for the bar, which unfortunately I had zero time to use. 

Only downside - besides no gym - was the lack of lighting in the room (why do hotels despite proper lighting?). I also wish this modern 2019 hotel had a water dispenser. Not a fan of buying bottled water. 

Overall, a great stay and I'd stay there again.",2024-02-06T04:52:45Z,73

Star were absolutely excellent and super friendly, I really loved that about our stay. I also appreciate the ability to cast to our tvs, not too many hotels I've stayed in allow for that so we could easily watch Netflix and Disney+ from our phones and cast to the tv (had my son with us too). We ate dinner at The Living Room which is located on the first floor of the hotel and wow our food was fantastic. Real cool lounge vibe and great music.

The amenities are limited, no mini fridge, no gym on site, not much going on other than your room. The bath products are all really minty and tingly that is fun. Not the most luxurious experience but for this price point it is beyond my expectations.

You also get a free drink ticket for happy hour between 4-6PM which I think is such a fun add on. There is also free bike rentals for 3 hours without reservations which is a super fun thing for when its not raining",2022-04-04T04:34:30Z,73

We read a few reviews that claimed this and brought ear plugs as a precaution--they block out the sound but nothing can stop the room from shaking.

First you wait in line anytime it's after 11, like it's about 30 minutes. You have to pay a cover to get in, ok that's standard, it's whatever. What they don't tell you is that once you get in, you can't get into the dance floor on the bottom unless you have a ""special blue stamp."" I have never been to a place that you pay and you're restricted access to a main area of the venue. Also you don't find all this out till after you pay cover and you're already in. That is absolutely ridiculous. Who would want to go to a place like that, Hotel Belmont you need to think about your customers. This is a very deserved one star.

The host told us that we 'can' come back after 9/9.30pm which was just an hour and half away from the point we walked in. If they truly were fully booked, tables should have been already filled as I know by common sense no restaurants would kick their clients out after an hour and a half.

We had a double queen room which was really spacious. Our room looked out onto Granville Street looking at a tattoo shop and pizza place. The room was nice and clean. The hotel was centrally located downtown within walking distance to BC Place (where the concert was held) and the water taxi to go to Granville Island. My only complaint is that the cover had a small stain that really rubbed me the wrong way because it appeared to be dried blood. Now that's definitely not acceptable!

If you haven't been to Vancouver yet it is a very walkable city and the weather is gorgeous (summer and winter) so there is lots to do. 

I came earlier than intended and they let me check in early. Everyone at the front desk was extremely helpful and they told me the wifi password upon checkin as i did not have a phone that worked in the country. They were also very good at giving restaurant reccomendations and holding my bag. There is a wine happy hour in the restaurant that is connected, seemed that only one in the bar was from the hotel drinking the free wine, but most of the city seemed pretty dead when I was wandering around. 

Biggest downfall of this location was the elevator did not work. I was not informed before checkin, and was actually fine climbing the stairs, however, if you cannot climb I wish they would have warned us, especially had I had a lot of luggage. 

Room was a little small, but I was 1 person with 2 queen beds. Had a desk and a nice size closet, fine for one person!

2502,Hotel Belmont,3.6,"Stayed at Comfort Inn for a night in December. I found a great deal on Hotwire and scored a room for less than $65. Pretty good since it is a three star hotel in the city.

The best thing about this Comfort Inn is the location. It is right in the middle of the Granville Entertainment District. Vancouver nightlife is just outside the door. Though the area near the hotel is a little seedy since there are a few downtrodden folks loitering the neighborhood.

This is a boutique hotel and feels like one. There is only one elevator and it is slow. Since my room was only a couple floors up, I decided to take the stairs aside from the trips when I was lugging my carry-on.

The room I got had a decent city view facing the big Tim Hortons across the street. The room was cosy, but small. Definitely the smallest room I have stayed in while visiting the Vancouver area. It is bigger than a hotel room in Asia, but not by much. The space between the beds and bathroom is relatively narrow. To save space, the TV is mounted on the wall instead.

The room has free Wi-Fi as well as a safe to keep your precious belongings. But there isn't a fridge or a fitness center. The bathroom is very stylish and looks like there was a recent renovation as it seems new. The hotel offers a breakfast (for a fee) in the Irish pub (Doolin's) downstairs. There is also a discount for hotel guests when dining at Doolin's.

I thought my stay here was just alright. It was good value for the buck. But it was not a good place to stay on a Saturday night. The windows are not soundproof so you will hear a lot of noise coming from the streets into the wee hours of the night. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to someone who needs a good night's sleep. This hotel is better suited for the nightlife reveler who needs a place to crash after a wild night of partying.",2015-02-23T02:44:16Z,73

We were there 2 nights with our baby daughter and everyone there made our stay very memorable! The location of this hotel is right in the middle of downtown and the prices were attractive.

Highly recommended!!",2015-08-25T22:10:14Z,73
2514,Hotel Belmont,3.6,"Would be a 5 star review except they charged my CRC a temporary hold when they had already charged for the security hold! They told us we'd get our refunds in 21 business days, that's insane! This place is great location wise! It's right across the street from the best clubs and bars in Vancouver! Staff is friendly even though they catch a little attitude sometimes. I'd definitely recommend to anyone! Rooms are really small and the breakfast cost money! So does parking! Oh yeah my friend had a guy spend the night with her after we got down partying and they charged us $30 extra because he spent the ""night"" (4am-9am) be aware of that!",2015-03-24T03:16:45Z,73
2515,Hotel Belmont,3.6,"Talk about dirty and over priced check in here. My most recent last stay in Vancouver apparently Adele concert was this night so no rooms in town at all, they reduced the rate from $589.00 to $529.00 included breakfast (which I didn't have) and parking outside in tight , open parking lot where all the drunks walk by screaming all night as they leave the bars. I'm middle age so if you're younger you may like the location but I would never return. 

The room was horrible small and really dirty carpet inside and hallways, broken air which blasts all night straight at your head, poor set up.
If this is the only last resort hotel as it was for me , then you're stuck, would definitely not return ever!",2016-07-23T18:13:10Z,73
2516,Hotel Belmont,3.6,"Stayed over (last night!) as I had a mid-week concert and thought it would be better to sleep close to work.

From the outside, the Comfort Inn looks super shifty, but that could not be further from the truth. The staff are all lovely and check-in was super speedy. 

The room was very small but it was more than enough for just me for one night. And the bed! So comfortable. Possibly the best sleep I've had in 2015. 

The only problem I had is that the sound proofing in the walls is very weak and I could hear everything happening in the hotel around my room. But after I fell asleep that no longer mattered. 

Oh, and did I mention that it's super cheap?",2015-03-19T19:06:52Z,73
2517,Hotel Belmont,3.6,"I am not particularly picky about hotels. I got a chance to travel Europe and stay in tome pretty interesting hostels. So overall, I think this hotel was everything you can expect from a hotel in the downtown area in Vancouver.

The staff was incredibly helpful. I needed help learning how to take the bus system. The front desk attendants let me know where I could get bus passes, and which bus to take out to Kitslano (where my friend lives). Also, they were great when I asked to switch rooms from a single queen to a double double. 

The rooms were clean and the cleaning staff was very respectful of my space. I had to come back to my room during late morning and the cleaning staff was in there. When I showed up, they let me be for a bit rather than hovering over me.

The last great aspect of this hotel is that it is right on the main drag in downtown. There are bars and clubs directly on the block. Also, you get a discount to the two bars in the basement if you show your room key. This aspect is also one of the hotels flaws. I stayed Thursday, Friday and Saturday night and all three nights the night life made the street outside my window noisy. Yelling, screaming and cars were making it hard to get to sleep early in the night. I ended up turning on the cooling/heating system and shutting my windows in order to cancel out some of the noise. However! This is when I found the second flaw to the hotel!!!

So the heating and cooling system is on a motion sensor. At first this seems like a great idea. Go green, right? However, I think the building engineer made a fatal design. If you are sleeping you are not moving. This means that in the middle of your sleep you will wake up cold or hot. To fix this however, all you need to do is wave your arms in the air and it'll go right back on.

Only those small things really bothered me, but I would totally stay there again. It is a great price and you live in relative comfort right in the downtown area.

Bueno!",2015-04-16T01:11:13Z,73
2518,Hotel Belmont,3.6,"Dear Management, 
If you have guests staying in your hotel for a week or more. I would suggest you guys put these folks in the upper level. We weren't happy when we could clearly hear our drunk neighbors talking loud or doing it in the bathroom.

We got a room on the first floor and the club/bar next door is very loud. I'd suggest you bring ear plugs.

We weren't happy when there were young club goers yelling across the hallway in the first floor. They even told older folks who tried to tell to keep it down to shut up. No security? I'm sure the front desk could hear them loud and clear through the stairwell. They did nothing about it. 

On our last day, we spotted a cockroach crawling on our wall. We left disgusted. Good thing, we didn't sleep another night.

Now for the PROS: 

This room was decent. Staff is nice. Comfy bed. Clean shower. The location is convenient. Restaurants, bus stops, shopping are all walking distance. I give this place three stars. However, it should be lowered knowing that there are cockroaches hanging out. Completely unacceptable. When you spot one, there are countless. This place will probably have a pest infestation in the near future.

By the way, I booked this placed based on the reviews here, but I thought I'd weigh in my experience.",2014-11-19T19:49:39Z,73
2519,Hotel Belmont,3.6,I am so happy I stayed here.  The staff was so nice.  They even helped with our suitcases when we arrived up the stairs!  So thoughtful. beth checked us in and was so wonderful.  She really was eager to please us.  Our room was on the 4th floor.  Decor was black and white. I saw the view of the streets from our window.  The bed and room were very comfortable. The best location.  1 mile to Canada Place.  Public Transportation right next to us.  So many food places nearby.  I am very happy I stayed here.  Great staff and room!!!!!!!!,2019-10-03T15:00:22Z,73
2520,Hotel Belmont,3.6,"Great hotel in the area, if not the best, for a very good rate.
Rooms are clean, bed and linen and towels are very cormfy. Big HQ TV. Quiet place. Free wifi is very good. 
The breakfast is located at the Irish Pub next to the hotel and was VERY good with a lot of choise and in large quantities: scones, toasts, cereals, apples, eggs and bacon...
Try to avoid rooms on the 1st floor so as you may ear people partying in the Pub :)",2013-01-02T22:37:15Z,73
2521,Hotel Belmont,3.6,They recently did renovations I guess because we stayed at this hotel last week and it didn't look anything like the pictures now I wish I would've took pictures. The renovations are way to cute. I wish we would've stayed here on our second night in the city because everything was super clean the lobby was warm and cozy. Decor was amazing. We arrived early from our flight and they made sure to get us as well as everyone else who had arrived early into a room as quickly as possible. Which was much appreciated. The staff was very helpful and very friendly. They made our first trip to Vancouver very nice. This will always be our go to hotel if we come here again. Trust me you won't be disappointed the beds are comfortable the decor is nice. Felt so upscale. Staff should update this with recent pictures because the current ones look like many hotels do in the area but this is not what it currently looks like it looks so much better now. Only downside to this was there was a lot of homeless people who were sort of aggressive but not to the point of we were scared we just avoided that street and went the other direction. Really good waffle bar a block away. And very great dining options all around. The rooms are a little small but so are some of the others in the area I thinks that's just how they are here.,2019-09-17T05:16:49Z,73
2522,Hotel Belmont,3.6,"Review is for the nightlife portion of this hotel. The staff that work here are completely entitled. Did not honour a guest list even when we had confirmation from the staff as proof, and instead we were told they ""get a lot of requests everyday"". They made the whole group pay cover and didn't offer any remediation when we pointed out their mistake. Unless you know someone who works here personally, you are pretty much treated like dirt. Once you're actually inside, good luck getting to the club portion - it's always ""at capacity"". So you end up paying cover just to hang out in a lounge. Save your time and money and go somewhere else.",2019-08-25T08:16:25Z,73
2523,Hotel Belmont,3.6,We had a wonderful stay in this hotel. It has been newly renovated and they did a great job on the renovation. The building is a classic structure from the early 1900s so the rooms are small and cozy. Everything was very clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. The downtown area that the hotel is at is safe with lots of tourists. I'd definitely stay here again.,2019-05-11T20:18:59Z,73
2524,Hotel Belmont,3.6,"The cost-benefit relation of this hotel is perfect. It is located in a very convenient area, near Robson (the popular shopping-street). It is true there are homeless people in the area, but for now it hasn´t been an issue for us. It is also true that the hotel is next to an Irish Pub, so maybe the first floor isn´t a good option. We are on the third one and we don´t hear a thing. 
The bedroom is pretty small but comfy. The bed and pillows are awesome, the same with the shower. The only bad thing is that the heat makes A LOT of noise when it's turned on.  There´s free coffee in the lobby and in your own room. Wifi is good and free. There´s a big TV in the bedroom with decent cable service.
The buffet breakfast is very good (American style) and it is served on the Irish Pub.",2014-12-16T08:06:36Z,73

Pub next door has a nice beer and whisky selection.  There's a restaurant in the basement of the property that turns into a nightclub in the evening.  Unless you are coming for the party, I'd highly recommend staying on the upper floors.  Last call in Vancouver isn't until 2:30 AM.  The POUNDING music from the nightclub doesn't stop until 3:00.  Earplugs didn't even help.",2015-11-30T21:31:09Z,73

2531,Hotel Belmont,3.6,"I pretty much never stay at a Comfort Inn type of hotels...just not my speed. This particular trip was booked by my friend at the last minute and we wanted to stay down town without spending $300 a night.

My initial knee-jerk reaction when we pulled up in a cab was ""oh, hell no...where did you bring me girl!"" However, in the course of the next two days I very quickly got over being a hotel snob :-)

Don't get me wrong, this is not the Westin or the W...but, the hotel was clean, rooms were spacious, staff was friendly and for only $130 a night the location was primo! Right in the thick of things off Granville, we were able to walk everywhere and had a fantastic time. Considering that we only used the hotel to sleep...this was the perfect pick.

This is not a place for families with kids or folks looking for some quiet time, since the hotel rooms are located in the middle of busy down town streets and they sit on top of an Irish pub :-) Which for our purposes only added to the overall city experience!",2010-10-11T22:39:08Z,73
2532,Hotel Belmont,3.6,"This is a great hotel if you're going to be spending the whole day out and about and using the room only as a place to sleep/take a shower. 

As another reviewer mentioned, the room is very small. The distance between the end of the bed and the wall is enough for a person to walk through tightly. Despite this, the room is very comfortable. The beds are soft and nice. The bathroom has very good water(shower/sink temperature responds quickly) and it seems as if the cabinet and counter were remodeled. 

In terms of location, it is absolutely superb. There is a parking lot next to the hotel that has free parking for hotel guests, something that other hotels don't offer. Sweet! The hotel is attached to an Irish pub, but I did not hear any noise or partying from my room on the second floor. 
The outside looks kind of run down, but if you step inside, it is cozy and comfortable. I would definitely recommend it. I am happy with my experience, especially at 56USD a night for a room with 2 double beds. 

I did not have the breakfast buffet included in the package(I believe it was an extra 10$ on Expedia), so I can't say anything about it. However, I would advise forgoing the ""free"" breakfast and getting something from Tim horton's across the street for around 3 dollars.",2016-01-05T05:44:37Z,73
2533,Hotel Belmont,3.6,"This was the best price I found downtown and the day of so my hopes weren't high but I was pleasantly surprised.  The rooms are crazy small; we had a room with two queen beds for two people but I would not ever have tried to put more than two people in there.  That being said, I'm always happy when the beds have white duvet covers rather than icky comforters- makes me feel like they get cleaned more often. The sheets and the room in general seemed really clean. 

Big perks: free parking came with the room (which may have just been the expedia deal) ($14 a night otherwise which is pretty cheap by comparison), free wifi, free printing in the lobby, and a free breakfast at the pub next door. The location was great for walking around to a bunch of neighborhoods. The beds were clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was large and clean.  What more do you need?

We parked the car in their lot and left it there until late in the afternoon the day we checked out, which saved us having to try to navigate driving and parking around the city.  We had a few drinks at the pub next door which had live music and a friendly bar staff.",2012-09-22T16:05:59Z,73
2534,Hotel Belmont,3.6,"My friends and I love this place! Book on Hotels.com or online somewhere if you need parking to be included too. When I went to check in, a lady in front of me had to pay $19/day for parking while mine was included and I paid $71/night and that includes taxes and fees. 

Pros:
-Great location! Walking distance to everything. We only used the car to drive out to Lynn Canyon and other parks
-Parking is in the lot right next to the hotel(make sure it's included when you book)
-Clean room, bed, and bathroom
-Friendly staff
-Great value and that's without bidding on Priceline
-Great view of downtown (we were on the 4th floor)

-Room was a bit small
-No fridge or microwave",2013-10-20T18:02:18Z,73

We decided to extend our stay for additional night. The staff was very helpful in letting us do that. We had to switch our room because all king size bed rooms were booked for that additional night. We left all our staff in the room and they took care of moving them while we went out sightseeing. 

The down side was that the second room with two beds that we moved to for the additional night had a paper thin wall. I could hear the conversation in the neighboring room. I think this particular room was a suite converted into regular rooms by adding a wall. 

It sucks cuz I loved my first room.",2010-10-12T07:39:49Z,73

Rooms very small with old rugs and metal framework. The bathroom had mold at the top of the window. The tub was high and could be dangerous for some people.

2539,Hotel Belmont,3.6,"The Comfort Inn may not look like much from the outside -- it is in that area of Granville after all -- but the inside will surprise you. After last year's stay at the Ramada, I was prepared for the worst, and this place was a pleasant surprise. Our room was very clean and well-decorated (take the leopard print curtains with a grain of salt), and even had a little HDTV. If I had brought my laptop, I would've loved the free WiFi, but even so, there was a computer in the lobby, which we used to its fullest. The staff was very friendly and helpful with figuring out bus schedules and making restaurant reservations. One star off only for the room size, which left very little floor space around the two beds. 

Maybe this speaks to the quality of the hotels I usually relegate myself to as a poor student, but this was literally one of the nicest places I've ever stayed.",2009-03-23T17:47:39Z,73

Here's a tip, make sure to join the Choice Privilege before booking, you'll get your member code through your email.  Once you get your member code, you can book your room for a cheaper price.  Our room was the  king bed, with the fireplace (unfortunately, it didn't work), flat screen Toshiba tv with cable.  The bathroom was nice, but no counter space, because all there is a single sink, which wasn't a problem since we just used the desk.  There's a coffee maker in the room, which we didn't use.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  It's a perfect location, because it's on Granville and Nelson.  Free wireless.  Parking is right beside the Inn, which is the parking lot, no valet parking.  Although we stayed on the 5th floor, our view was not desirable, we were looking down to the apartments next door.  The view is not a problem since we only opened the curtains to let the natural light in the room.   
I'm only giving it 3 stars because of their breakfast.  Although what they already offer is great, hard boiled eggs, bagels, fruits, bread, coffee, tea, orange juice, apple juice, cereals, you make your own waffles....what they need are meats and scrambled eggs.

Yes we had a 1st floor room above the rocking bar but we got home at midnight and did not have a problem sleeping despite some of the monotonous bass noise.  They were highly occupied so a room switch could not be acommodated.  Free wifi was helpful.  Parking in open lot next door for about $13.   Very convenient to everything.,2011-12-22T04:24:14Z,73

This is a major party street, so it can get loud at night.  There is an awesome irish restaurant in the basement that doubles as a pub/club at night too. 

Hotel is reasonably priced for being right downtown.  Nice beds and rooms (flat screen TVs and WiFi) with some decent views of downtown on the upper floors.  There is no gym on site, but the front desk provides a day pass to the Steve Nash sports club which is only a few block north.  FYI - parking is an additional $11 (at least) per night.

I've stayed at my share of crappy looking Comfort Inns around California and Las Vegas so my expectations were low. It's located right in downtown near Granville, and it's connected to an Irish bar. When my taxi driver dropped me off to this place, I winced, thinking ""ugh, well it looks like I got what I paid for."" But once I actually got to my room it was a little bit better than I expected. A little flatscreen TV was hooked up to the wall and I had free WiFi in the room! The room was small, and my window view was the adjacent building. The bathroom looked as if it was recently renovated and was so big in there, it felt like it was half the size of the actual bedroom portion of the room. I think the only negative thing I can say about this place is that if you're a light sleeper, you better get to sleep before the music starts up at the Irish bar next door. I could easily hear the loud music and vibrations from that place, and I was on the second floor of the hotel.

Food, malls, imax cinema, ice skating, Watermania.  Highly recommend for central location to stuff. Vancouver isn't that far away so this works well for us as a family of 5.  Go with the suite, kitchen, 2 queens and a pullout sofa.  They do not have cots or rollaways. They use DOVE shampoo and conditioner.  Love it.",2022-12-24T23:48:57Z,43

They have a good complimentary breakfast, and the cinnamon rolls at breakfast were noteworthy. They I suggest staying at an an American Brand hotel (like this location) for comfort, when I stayed at Canadian based hotels the hotels were very good, but the beds were a little smaller.

It's not a big deal, yet it is an important item to me. I sent an email inquiry, and my husband called to ask about it. While I didn't get a response to my email, my husband was able to talk to the front desk. Unfortunately, whoever he spoke to immediately said there wasn't any cap left behind - they said this right away without even bothering to check or at least asking for more information.

My husband went out to grab food and came home with charcuterie, sushi and McDonalds.

2566,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Riverport Richmond,3.9,"We had a nice 2 night stay here recently. 

The location is on the outskirts of town--though conveniently near 99--so there isn't much aside from the plaza immediately adjacent to us (movie theater, ice rink, the Old Spaghetti Factory, and a few other businesses) and local eggs, flowers, and produce off of No. 6 Rd. The hotel itself does have a retail section in the lobby that has food (frozen and instant) and snacks and personal care items. Helps that there's a coffee maker (read: hot water maker) and microwave in the rooms.

I found the hotel lobby to be clean, modern, and inviting when I arrived. Service was professional and accommodating when we requested to switch rooms. I did find two stray coarse hairs on the sheets when I got into bed but chose to ignore as it was late and I was tired. Everything else was satisfactorily clean. 

The AC was on super strong in our section of the hotel on the 4th floor. When we turned on the heat in our room it gave an awful burnt smell for a while so we had to open the window. The smell did eventually go away. 

The complimentary breakfast was a nice perk with many options: ready made egg omelets, hard boiled eggs, turkey and pork sausages, milk and cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, bread and bagels, bananas and apples along with coffee and tea. It was your run of the mill, lower grade continental food fare, but I was able to have peanut butter cinnamon banana toast due to the condiment packs they provided :) 

Worthy to note that the parking spots behind the hotel are small and narrow. There were many spots marked for small cars but even the regular sized spots were smaller than I'm used to--tricky with our SUV. 

The walls are thin so you can hear noise from the hallway but I always bring earplugs so slept well in spite of that. Overall a good value and would stay again!",2017-09-12T19:15:35Z,43
2567,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Riverport Richmond,3.9,"Uhhhg. Had a confirmed reservation. Showed up at 3:21. 
I was told there were no clean rooms so I would have to wait 45min to 1 hour. No worries so I wait. After 2 hours still no room and during that time 10-15 people are able to check in, get keys and leave the lobby to their room. 
It's not been hours so I politely request to cancel because a room for me still wasn't available. They said they have to talk to their manager to cancel and the outcome was wanting to charge me for 1 night because of the cancelation. Sad policy considering the circumstances. After talking to the manager the second time they magically now had a room available but in that time another. 30 minutes goes by and I just book a room at another hotel that has available rooms down the street.

Telling me there are zero rooms clean while others get keys was strange to me. I was very respectful and polite and not acting like an ass. The staff was also very nice. 

Wanting to charge me for one day because I canceled after waiting in their lobby is just bad business practice Holiday Inn. It's not the money but the principle. 

If you guys need money that bad why not work for it?

The breakfast, that was included, wasn't very appetizing.  The eggs were rubbery, the bacon was greasy and the rest of the options were all just bread or bagels or biscuits really.  
The hotel staff were nice but didn't seem very knowledgeable when we had questions.  
Last but not least, the tv itself was nice but the programming seemed to be from the 90's.  Tv listings guide that you have to catch as it flows by and if you miss it you have to wait for it to go all the way through again.  And weird channels like 28-1 and 31-2.  It was very odd.

The location is beyond compare if you are playing in a hockey tournament next door as there is no need to drive and there are several decent restaurants and pubs within walking distance. 

The hotel and furnishings were in excellent condition cosmetically and the room was large and comfortable with large size newer flat screen TV, small fridge and microwave. 

The included breakfast buffet was okay, but could be much better by just including bacon in the offerings. There was an indoor swimming pool on site as well.

2571,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Riverport Richmond,3.9,"After staying at various AirBnBs during the first leg of my Vancouver trip, I spent my final days at this Holiday Inn Express. 

I had a King Suite room, which was located at the ""older side"" of the hotel. The room was great for the fact that the bed was comfortable, the pillows were soft, and the air conditioning was functional. The lobby and hallways leading up to the rooms were clean and orderly. Parking is free. This hotel has everything you need if you're just looking for a pitstop to shower, relax, and rest. 

However, considering the $250/night rate that I was charged after taxes and fees, the value was not nearly as great as renting through AirBnB. For almost half of that price, I was able to stay in swanky one bedroom flats at Metrotown and Richmond, which had just about the same or better facilities/amenities, but with much more personality and complexities. 

By contrast, my King Suite did not feel very homey. Parts of the couches were soiled with stains. I was unable to power up the TV in the bedroom, and the 32"" TV in the living room was tiny considering the size of the living room. Both of these TVs were manufactured in 2008, isn't it time for an update? Some of the furniture just seemed tacky, especially the bench that was way too low to be used with the dining table. I honestly think that this older side of the hotel needs to be refreshed. The design and decor appear to be stuck in the 2000's and do not fit into the contemporary/boutique theme found in the newer wing and lobby.

The overall hotel experience is not just about the accommodation, but hospitality is equally as important. The hallmarks of hospitality are good service and personal touch, which were lacking based on my experience. I found it odd that my AirBnB hosts (not even trained in customer service) were much more warm, savvy, and welcoming than the people who worked at the hotel front desk. When I wanted to check out, the two employees at the front desk couldn't be bothered to look up from their computer screen for a moment to acknowledge me. 

Unless Holiday Inn makes changes, I'll be looking for accommodations through AirBnB instead the next time I'm traveling to Richmond.",2016-07-29T06:12:53Z,43
2572,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Riverport Richmond,3.9,"My family visited Richmond for a weekend this August and although our stay was pleasant, I forgot to Yelp it!
This hotel is about 15 minutes away from downtown Richmond.  You'll pass through a somewhat industrial / business park area, then a narrow residential street, before seeing the hotel (and neighboring movie theater) pop into view.  There was plenty of parking available to the side of hotel.

Checking in (and out) was simple - all the employees were very friendly and helpful.  The interior has a polished look and it was very clean. Our room (two queen beds) was pretty spacious, providing an adequate amount of space for the four of us. 

** Complimentary Breakfast - Being a light nibbler in the morning, I'm always grateful for complimentary breakfast!  I really enjoyed the huge selection of both hot and cold items, both of which were constantly monitored / stocked.  They had sausage, eggs, cereals, yogurt and other common breakfast fare.  It gets pretty busy, but luckily there are two dining rooms that have this breakfast buffet line.

** Pancake Machine: I've never seen one of these before, so I'm giving it a special shout-out. With a push of a button, out comes a pancake!  However, I enjoyed watching it more than eating it.  The pancake was just okay, haha. In addition to having it available for breakfast, they also had a pancake night. TIP: I'm not sure if Pancake Night is a regular event here, but make sure to get there early because it's only served ""until supplies last"".

Since our stay was so short (one night), I didn't have much time to explore the recreational offerings. There is a small gym and indoor pool right next to each other which appeared well-kept. Nearby, there is also an outdoor basketball court.

If you intend to visit Richmond, this is a great hotel to look into as it was affordable, comfortable and convenient!",2016-02-24T02:17:39Z,43

Holiday Inn Express & Suites didn't disappoint on all counts. 

We arrived at the hotel a little after 9:00 p.m., exhausted but optimistic. Check-in was a breeze and the front desk even granted our request for a late check-out. The room was spacious, clean and well-maintained. The bathroom also had a complete spread of toiletries and clean, fluffy towels. We had a peaceful slumber that night. 

The next morning, I decided to give their breakfast buffet a try while my partner-in-dine opted to stay in bed and maximize his snooze-time. There was a good selection of both hot and cold breakfast choices. All the hotel staffers were courteous and helpful.

I really think this is the responsibility of the Yelp Vancouver editors to consolidate & correct the confusions. 

About the hotel itself is as good as it gets and not much complaint about it except for the price fluctuates so much... It can be as low as shy of hundred or up to $200+. That supply & demand system is definitely NOT consumer friendly... I say.",2013-08-22T00:23:10Z,43

The beds were comfortable. They had 2 types of pillows: firm and soft. I preferred firm over soft. 

They also had a microwave and small refrigerator.

Large clean and updated room, friendly staff, welcoming foyer, good assortment of Continental Breakfast options, clean pool, good gym and quiet location with parking.

2579,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Riverport Richmond,3.9,"I really like this Holiday Inn Express (and I've stayed at lots of 'em). 

Yes, this location is a suburb of Vancouver (you will need to drive 20 mins to get downtown) but we were driving in and wanted to find a safe location with free parking, an indoor pool and a good deal. This fit the bill, and then some. All the hotels we priced downtown were at least 30% more expensive, had far less amenities, no/paid parking and were in questionable neighborhoods. I think to stay downtown, you have to be willing to shell out the big bucks to stay in a nicer hotel -- or give up a lot of amenities.

Anyhow--

Upon check in I was pleasantly surprised to find out they had upgraded us into a king suite for free (since I'm a rewards club member, I guess). This greatly elevated the value for the moderate price paid. This room was MASSIVE and the ceiling was insanely high and gorgeous. It was way nicer than any other member of this chain I've ever stayed in. The king size bed was very nice, there were two huge flat-screen tv's, a very nice bathroom (with a large shower and good water pressure - hurrah!), a living room with a pull-out sofa and all decor/fixtures were very updated. This location was only built a couple years ago, so that probably helps.

I was also pretty happy with the indoor pool and spa. Both were open til 11pm, kept warm and there was a changing area and towels right off the entrance. This gets big points from me.

The complimentary breakfast was the best of any hotel we've stayed at recently. It's actual food you'd want to eat at home, and the menu changes daily. My boyfriend was especially impressed with some sort of robotic pancake making machine they have. 

To top it all off, the service was excellent and went above and beyond what was expected. All staff members were very kind and accommodating, the housekeeping did an excellent job every day and we were quite happy with our stay.",2011-10-06T22:47:24Z,43

It's a place to spend the night and a comfortable one at that. It's close to lots of restaurants so you don't need to go far if you are looking for a place for dinner after a long travel day. The staff was very nice and accommodating and the beds are really comfortable. I got a good nights sleep which is really all I cared about.,2016-07-09T07:13:20Z,43
2581,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Riverport Richmond,3.9,"Because I had lost my passport I had to stay an extra day and was fortunate to have a very good friend who was willing to stay with me since I had no money or identification. We stayed one night at this Holiday Inn Express on July 16, thinking that it would be convenient to the airport and that we would not have to rent a car for another day.  But we found that it was in a pretty remote area of Richmond and that the food choices were very limited.  So we ended up renting a car for an extra day.  

The extra cost was not good but what was worse was what happened to my friend who had graciously volunteered to assist me.  She had mentioned to me that the sheets felt funny to her the night before but I did not think much about it.  However, she woke up the next morning with a slight rash on her face which got progressively worse as the day went on.  We were at the US Consulate and I did notice that there were red bumps on her face.  We flew back to Los Angeles that night and she went to her doctor the next morning.  He told her that it was contact dermatitis.  The only contact she had was with the sheets and pillow cases at the hotel.  We did not stay anywhere else before we got home to Los Angeles,

When she called the hotel management, they were unwilling to believe her and only offered her points.  I feel terrible since she has been going to the acupuncturist to relieve the swelling and itch as well as investing in a lot of medicine - all because she helped me out by staying with me. This is not the way a hotel should treat a guest who has an ill effect from his/her stay.  She is still not recovered from the rash and it has been over 10 days.  I still hope the hotel will do the right thing by reimbursing us for the stay - the least they can do.",2017-07-28T22:32:28Z,43

Loved the free parking and the parking lot was pretty big so you normally won't have problems finding a spot.

Extra plus: they have free hot breakfast every morning from 6:30-9:00 on weekdays and 7:00-10:00 on weekends which makes things soo convenient!! They have potatoes, sausages, eggs, toast, bagels, yogurt, fruits, and many more!

The 2nd morning, they offerend cheese omelets and bacon instead of the scrambled eggs and sausage.  Variety was good.

The rooms were modern, clean and comfy.  The room had a mini fridge for our use and microwave.  The shower was large and had a sliding glass door rather than the standard tub with curtain.  The water pressure was just right...not too strong and not too weak.  

The hotel also offered a business center with 2 computers and we used it to do more vacay research online as well as early check in at the airport back in Seattle.  Was very convenient.  Also, the hotel offered a pool, whirlpool and an exercise room with various machines.  It would been nice if they had free weights instead of the weight machine, but it will do.  

The only weak point about the hotel is the location as it seems to be random (next to a movie plex and hockey rink in a residential area).  It is about a block or 2 from the freeway so it is freeway convenient to the 99.  Wish there were more stores around to walk to.",2009-06-03T09:21:09Z,43

2592,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Riverport Richmond,3.9,"Friends and I wanted to check out the night market and decided to spend the night instead of doing a day trip from Seattle. We ended up booking their 2-bedroom King suite room. I booked by calling the front reservation desk and not online. It seems there are quite a few Holiday Inn Express hotels so every time I look them up I have to make sure it had the address of  No. 6 Rd.

I would give this hotel a 5-star rating but I have to remove a star for how they handled our check-in. We were told we can check in at 3pm but upon arriving at 3:30pm we were informed the room was not available and we were told to come back in about an hour. We decided to wait in the lobby instead since we were pretty tired from our trip and didn't feel like getting back in the car to explore. There was a small conference going on so the lobby felt very busy and noisy. We asked for an update and another lady at the counter said ""Don't worry the room won't go anywhere."" which was very off-putting and definitely very poor customer service. When the room was finally ready, they gave us granola bars for the inconvenience. We set aside that bad first impression and finally settled into our room. We did ask for a late check out but we waited for the staff to change at the counter since we really didn't appreciate how we were being treated when we checked in. There was a staff member named Richard, he was really friendly and very nice.  So the 4-star rating is based on cleanliness and bang for the buck if you stay here. 

For the price, the finishings for this 2-king bedroom suite were really nice. Granite counter tops, full size fridge, stove and a stocked utensil and pot/pan kitchen. The place was very comfortable and roomy and we were all very satisfied with how much space we can stretch out. We also used their hot-tub, pool and ate breakfast the next day. Their breakfast had really great options for a Holiday Inn. Fresh pastries, eggs, drinks and pancakes made to order. 

All in all great experience. Would come back here again for a quick over-night trip in the Vancouver/Richmond area. I wouldn't say this place is as grand and luxurious as a 5-star hotel but it definitely offers the BASICS if you are just passing through. Don't expect any turn-down service or paper at your door when staying here. Free wi-fi and parking.",2013-09-09T17:13:46Z,43

2596,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Riverport Richmond,3.9,"Room was nice but for $500 for two nights it should be.   Had to leave a note to get hand lotion as none was in the room.  No biggie but at these prices the hotel should get it right. Towels thin and cheap.  Points off for the only mirror in the place being small and at the sink so as to make dressing not convenient. My main complaint is 1) don't serve day old dried out sweet rolls at breakfast (they vary greatly from day to day so you can tell they are stale sometimes) and 2) don't allow children to play soccer in the hallway for hours on end.  10 kids aged 4-6 had a soccer ball and children's hockey sticks and ran right by an employee screaming at the top of their lungs and the employee just ignored it. Little boys and girls screaming went on for hours. I took out my hearing aids and put the TV on maximum volume to try to drown it out, and I WAS AT THE END OF THE HALL so I can only imagine how those in the middle of the hall were affected. Then again I was located at the ""goal"" area with the soccer ball and hockey sticks striking my door. I finally drove to the shopping mall for some ""peace and quiet"" having been driven from my room. Terrible parenting not to be blamed on the hotel, but screaming and running with a ball and hockey sticks RIGHT PAST A HOTEL EMPLOYEE  with toys all over the hall, and nothing is said by the employee?  Not acceptable.   Yes there must have been a soccer event that weekend and yes it was raining and the poor kids had no dry place to play.  But it's BC for gosh sakes, put on a rain outfit and go outside! Don't ruin the peace of other guests.  Selfish, ignorant parents and indifferent staff.  Stay at the Fairmont for about the same price where they don't put up with this behavior. I should have run up and down the hall and put my TV on high volume with the door propped open at MIDNIGHT when the parents were trying to rest.

No rain today, huge empty parking lot across from both, kids still running and screaming in halls - so o excuse, just bad parenting.I should have walked out of my room naked, that might get the parents to reel in their little dears.",2016-05-29T16:11:18Z,43

No respect ! i was told that there was gonna be an event and there is  going to be some noise below my room, no apologies nothing and they asked if thats ok, i said of course not. I could have gone to a diff hotel but it was already late. The manager then came in and instead of apologizing, she instructed me to go and find a different hotel for the night, unbelievable!!! i then asked for the main no of the costumer service from her, she went inside her office at the back of the front desk and there i waited for more than 5 mins, finally i asked the front desk where was she, the front desk told me that she will call me in my room to give the no. What kind of a manager who doesnt know the no of the company's costumer care or have it at hand. Finally she came out and handed me the no and out of frustration i did not thank her when she  handed me the no., so she said thank you loudly behind my back. I felt so humilated as there were other people around, she was mean! I cant even imagine how she became a manager!

What a crazy scene on Grandville street over the weekend.  Super long lines of people waiting to get in the clubs with Belmont no exception.  2 of the largest bouncers I've ever seen controlling the Belmont club queue.

Restaurant/bar (Living room) opens at 1200 daily, closed Mon/Tue), their club floor opens at 2200 (Fri-Sun only)

Cozy intimate bar/dining area.  Large bar with a humongous variety of drinks.

Amazingly, their ""bar food"" came out quickly, hot, fresh and tasty.  Not even sure if I would call this bar food as it's a step above what I normally eat at bars.

Service staff were friends and efficient despite the standing room only crowd.

We booked a 2 night stay following a cruise, wanting a convenient downtown location at a relatively reasonable price, and Hotel Belmont did not disappoint. The location to some less desirable areas of Vancouver may be a bit distracting, yet when you enter the hotel you are greeted by an exceptional staff, who will make your stay wonderful. The room design was less institutional than most other hotels, offering a calm atmosphere with comfortable beds and a Nespresso machine. When leaving the hotel to see the wonderful city of Vancouver, we learned that going to the right eventually led us to a popular restaurant area.

The theme is all retro and maybe 60s. Reminds me of a Katy Perry or Pink music video, with all the bright colours. So much pink everywhere.

Special mention goes to that cool looking DJ booth. There are also some rather interesting neon signs (profanity) on the walls. Cool to look at but kinda kitschy. Everyone knows these things be all over social media in no time. There are also some old school coin-op arcade machines, and a small area in the corner with a couch and some TV (aka basement style) video games.

Staff were friendly and helpful.

Hotel is really nice, very clean and beautiful Christmas decorations.
Service is okay, they didn't explain everything to us. They inform us about breakfast and WiFi connection. Also, we requested extra towels it took a while for them to send it to us. We had to call them twice.
Parking is $45 for self parking a day and valet $55 a day. For self parking you can park P3-P5 and not reserved area. Parking lot is very narrow.
Breakfast is not free, $37 per person. Breakfast was delicious.
Rooms are bit small and crowded but it's very clean.

2614,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"So to be fair, we stayed at a Four Seasons in another city prior to this hotel  which probably taints my perspective. Plusses- loved the location, lobby, staff. There was live music during happy hour where fellow geriatrics had dinner at 4:30pm. The bellman from Syria was so informative and cool and really made our coming and going fun. The room did have a good coffee system which is always a plus. The handheld shower a blessing. And for some reason we ended up in an accessible room which left me neutral.

The room was just a room. I never unpacked. It was kind of seedy and desperately needs a refresh. The carpet was a bit off putting and i wasn't comfortable barefoot.  i was inexplicably incensed that the beds are not made nor towels refreshed until the third day. I'm all about ecological efforts but that's just plain cheap. 

I felt the place was pricey for mediocre guest rooms since we did not enjoy the lobby or pool or other up to date spaces.",2023-09-08T03:23:17Z,189
2615,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"Recent stay of five nights was over the top with outstanding guest service and quality of the food. The daily price was $185 USD which was very reasonable as I happen to stay during the first week of December which was before Christmas week as well as the fact that Cruise season was over for the year. I had stayed here on several previous occasions with the last time being 5-6 years ago. Want to recognize Dwayne, Lily and Noel who worked the Showcase Restaurant and Bar and the Asian Hostesses who worked the Executive Lounge at night and in the mornings that I was able to get some breakfast.  Other members of management were recognized previously. Minus a half star as the rooms have not been updated and sorely need a modern refresh.",2023-12-12T05:58:14Z,189
2616,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"One of the better Marriott hotels we've stayed at.  Courteous, down to earth and helpful staff made the stay wonderful even though there was construction super early in the morning.  The rooms are quiet enough where the downtown hustle and bustle will not wake you up.

Many restaurants, shops and Timmy's (Tim Hortons) are nearby so if you don't feel like staying around the hotel there are plenty of options within walking distance or a short Uber ride.

This hotel is centrally located from public transit and lightrail to and from the airport (YVR).  The added convenience will give you time to pack as much as you can into your trip.  Would recommend this hotel if you want to be centrally located and run around town!",2023-01-22T07:46:03Z,189
2617,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"Pros:
- Perfect location. Close to everything downtown. Loved being able to walk to the water front and have access to many eateries in the area. (I recommend walking to Robson St!)
- Comfortable beds and rooms. Good size and comfortable.
- Cookies and water in the lobby
- Concierge was helpful!

Cons:
- The price could get really high (I guess there was a conference in town so the rooms were $800+. Luckily I had a company discount so I didn't have to pay that price or else I would've never stayed here.) So it's worth the $250/night but if it hikes up, don't do it. 
- The bathroom was surprisingly small - One of those you have to either keep the door open to access the toilet or close it all the way so your legs can fit situation. It's was sink, toilet, bathtub all smushed together side by side with no extra floor space.",2022-08-18T20:08:32Z,189

The bathroom also had both a standing shower AND bath tub AND a large window. (I find it unusual for a bathroom to have any kind of window, never mind a large size window with blinds that is not high above.)  These three things indicate that it's a good size bathroom.  I also liked the digital scale in the bathroom (I have never seen one in any hotel) and a small shelf for towels. 

Hotel is also very close walking distance to harbor and Standley Park. 

Restaurant located in hotel has pretty good food, albeit we only ordered a child's hamburger meal and dessert.",2022-07-24T01:18:26Z,189
2619,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"Don't bother with this place. There is a funky smell when you take the elevators to the parking. I asked management about this and they said they never noticed it. The room was also outdated and had a weird smell. If you like a cooler room, you will not find that here, as the coldest setting on the thermostat still blows hot air. We switched rooms and that didn't fix the issue. Apparently people don't like cold air in winter. But keep in mind, if everyone is blowing warm to hot air in a hotel, it will start to get a bit warm, and I like to sleep in a cool room.

We had vouchers for complimentary breakfasts. On Sunday, that included waffles from the kitchen and an omelet station.  Monday was scaled back a bit, but still really nice for a hotel breakfast buffet. 
The room was a pretty good size for a city hotel. Clean, comfortable bed. The view was of a building under construction across the street, so if such things are important to you, splurge for a mountain view. We didn't mind.",2022-05-30T16:33:46Z,189

Underground parking available for guests.  Garage elevator to hotel lobby and were warmly and cordially greeted by a professional member of the Concierge staff.  

Check-in was quick and efficient.  Accommodations and facility amenities were as advertised.

Room was clean, organized, and well appointed.  Room lighting was more than adequate for our needs.  Bathroom and shower were clean and spotless.  The usual support items were available and well presented.

Five Stars for the attitude of all the staff members we came into contact with - and observed - during our stay.  We especially appreciate the due diligence of staff to monitor the hotel lobby and adjacent areas.  Their physical presence and oversight was reassuring.

A very good location for waterfront and downtown activities.  Most of the popular sites are just a few blocks away.

The location is excellent, near Coal Harbour and four blocks from Robson street, yes not on the busiest of thoroughfares. The food service is the best I've had at a Marriott. Terrific...the building is a bit dated, built in the early 1990s and they've worked hard at keeping current.

All service top notch, from the front desk, to valet to maid, all good, except that my wife asked for extra coffee in the room and they never showed up. Another knock is the lack of negotiable outlets next to the bed side. Surprising miss. I carry 10' charge cords, so I made it work.

2626,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"The service here is amazing.  From the registration, to the staff supporting the restaurant.  They were very personable and pleasant to be around.  The food for breakfast was phenomenal.  I honestly was blown away by the quality of the food, but that may be because I'm used to the terrible quality of food within the US.  The bacon was crispy, the croissants were buttery, the pancakes were great, they offered unit dosed platters of fruit that tasted fresh.. even their coffee was good.

My only criticism was that it took a while for us to get drinks during breakfast (but we could see they were extremely busy).  And come to think about it, I guess the treatment with the waitstaff could be improved.  During my brief discussions with the servers, we discovered that they were not allowed to have any beverages during their shift.  I saw three individuals who worked until 10-11pm on Valentines Day and saw them early the next morning for their breakfast shift.  How does Marriott expect these employees to go through an 8 hour shift without being dehydrated?  Not really sure if this last paragraph speaks to the quality of your experience at the hotel, but it shouldn't be overlooked.

Also-
It's at a great location- we woke up this morning and ran to Stanley Park.  We are now headed to Robson street to shop.

2630,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"This is my company's preferred hotel in Vancouver.  Even if it weren't, it would be my preferred hotel.

Why?  Mostly for their customer service.  I come here about once a month, and the staff recognize me and that I'm a regular but not in an obsequious way.  

I get great service from everyone, and then spectacular service from the ones who recognize me as a regular.  I know what to expect and am never disappointed.   Love that I can order lunch for the next day when I order dinner in the lounge at night - they always accommodate me in my needs.

I love the variety and selection of their menu - I am a firm fan of the seafood chowder but still always can't finish the generous portion they provide - I've even tried ordering a smaller portion and can't always do it justice!  I guess that's a good thing!

 Just always feel pampered and taken care of when staying here... need an umbrella? Check!  Need directions? Check!  Need recommendations? Check!  Need a car wash extra early in the a.m?  Double check!

On my last visit the valet said he didn't need to see my claim check -he knew the car was mine.  I asked him if it was because it was the dirtiest car he had ever seen... he had to god grace to demur even though we all know the answer was yes!

First off I'm a Marriott gold member (close to platinum) and there were literally NO PERKS to that during this stay.  No gift.  No upgrade.  No free wi fi.  Nothing.

The entire hotel is super dated and in need of a serious update.  

I'd put this hotel at a 3 star level looking at it but they charge a 5 star price. 

2002 called and it wants the 30 inch room television back. 

The room air conditioner is extremely loud.  You literally can't hear the television when it kicks on and it will blow papers off the desk.  Also it kicks on for about 2 minutes EVERY 10 minutes.  Oh, just kicked on again, let me turn the tv back up. 

The maids didn't come until 4 pm. By then we were back from tourist stuff and getting ready for dinner. Guess we won't get the bed made. 

Called the concierge about a hotel shuttle to the suspension bridge.   They just told us there is no shuttle.  Come to find out there is a FREE shuttle from the Hyatt concierge and we got 5 dollar off coupon from that other concierge.  I'm pretty effing sure the free shuttle is common knowledge.  Like seriously wtf.  They also said they'd call us back about something and never did. 

I've stayed in a lot of Marriotts.  Over 28 nights just this year and this is BY FAR the WORST experience.  Skip this one and stay at the Westin.",2023-09-04T18:05:31Z,189

When I got a 3rd room key I was able secure another elevator and realized that the prior one was defunct. I let the front desk know the issue hoping they could fix it for other guests. 

When I got to my room I unceremoniously walked into a used room. I was so shocked this happened generally but doubled with COVID guidelines are still in effect in Canada. I walked downstairs and told the front desk who seemed shocked even when I showed them the picture. I think I got a voicemail from the manager but it was bad audio.

Turns out many cabs don't accept and we waited through 5 cabs before getting a ride a half hour later.  Marriott should have a better system.",2023-06-11T17:22:50Z,189

Service rep were all very friendly and polite. Check in was easy and we enjoyed the high floor Harbor view that  they upgraded us to.

2637,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"We forgot completely prior review warnings about another Pinnacle hotel confusingly right across on Hastings when finding parking; and getting a smaller rental car because of tight turning in hotel's garage! Parking cost $45 per day. Executive Lounge on 25th floor serving breakfast, afternoon snacks, and evening drinks was available for Bonvoy elite members. Paradoxically, members were charged for drinks: e.g. $17 for wine. Happy Hour twice a day at the lobby restaurant was a better deal at half the price! Staff at front desk, Executive Lounge, and restaurant were friendly and helpful. Our unique shape, corner room on 20th floor had a lot of windows, looking at surrounding tall buildings and a glimpse of the harbor. It was quiet with plenty of bathroom counter & closet space, strong shower, and a comfortable king bed. It's a four-block walk to Robson Street for shopping.

2639,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"Stayed here the week before Christmas with friends to have proximity to the Christmas market and all things walkable.  The 3 night stay was quite nice until we went to leave and receive our vehicle back from valet.  They brought it to the turnaround and didn't say a word about the reddish brown paint on the driver side window.  We immediately noticed and asked about this, while simultaneously realizing the paint would not come off and that the window was actually etched with several scrapes impairing use of the window.  It was impossible to imagine what caused this as the door itself was undamaged.  In follow up communications the hotel suggested that a valet sign stand had fallen into the driver side window while the car was in their care.  The hotel referred us to their state mandated insurance (ICBC) but insurance refused coverage.  Meanwhile we obtained estimates that it will cost around $300 US to replace the driver side window and make us whole.  This is below most deductibles anyway and extremely straightforward.  We took this back to Marriott and asked them to pay it directly to the glass shop which they refuse to do despite admitting that this happened on their watch.  We hold out hope that other Canadian Marriott's have better customer service for their Marriott rewards members, but sadly are unable to ever stay at this one again.",2024-01-14T01:15:41Z,189
2640,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"Overall it was a great place to stay, perfect location (very walkable) and I would come back! 

Customer service: Extremely friendly from the moment that we arrived. They even put out hot tea (chai flavored) and an assortment of cookies for everyone. A really nice touch.

Location: Great location and very close to the water and Stanley park should you decide to do that walk. 

Executive lounge: Note that it closes at noon on Fridays and Saturdays...which is too early! No dinner or dessert services on those days unlike other Marriott's in Vancouver. 

Pool/Gym: Pool and hot tub are indoor. It also has a steam room and sauna. The gym is very large with many different machines. 

The room: Our room was a bit small, but very nice and clean. It overlooked the water and had a great view  The bathroom even had a bathtub and shower. The assortment of provided toiletries were very nice and they also provided ample towels.",2020-01-29T02:42:25Z,189

This brings me to the concierge services. We had the pleasure of asking for help to get out hop on hop off (HoHo) tickets and we're helped by Verinda. Verinda was a knowledgeable and enthusiastic support for our having a fun trip. 

She quickly handled our HoHo tickets and told us about the Celebration of Light. The Honda Celebration of Light is an annual musical fireworks competition in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The evening was Croatia  set to bedazzle spectators with a show. We had no idea this was even a thing and after telling us about it, she quickly booked us tickets on a cruise boat, so we could watch from the comfort of the water. 

The rooms were nice, clean, and the location is brilliant. The HoHo stops just across the street from the hotel. And the ease of arriving, getting our rooms, getting an evening plan sorted was lovely. And, I loved the view of the float planes flying in and out of the harbor.",2019-08-04T01:46:10Z,189

Staff is always super friendly at check in. It's quick and painless, and I've usually gotten room upgrades. The decor could use some updating, but it's nothing major. 

The beds are really comfy. Not too firm or soft. Just right for an excellent nights sleep. And when you put a ""Privacy Please"" sign on the room- Housekeeping actually does not interrupt you! Unlike some other places, where staff just comes on in anyway ! 

They have a 24 hour Business Centre just off the lobby by the front desk. Besides computers, it also features comfy couches and a TV. 

On the other side they have their Restaurant / Lounge. They have Happy Hour 3-6 and 9-11.

Staying here to celebrate my Birthday this weekend, I mentioned to the very nice guy ( Greg I believe ) at check in. Today I was surprised to get s call asking if they could bring an amenity to the room.

I was presented with a tray with a large bottle of San Pellegrino sparkling water and a large slice of yummy chocolate cake with some fruit and Happy Birthday in white chocolate. How cool is that ?",2018-12-07T11:58:02Z,189

""give me a couple of days to get this sorted"". May 3 (five months later!) after many emails back and forth, I was informed that the hotel would not be covering anything. It was up to me to go through ICBC and pay The $500 deductible. Would I stay here again?  Not so much. I'm old school I guess, I thought a person's words meant something.

It just depends on who has the best rates which varies. This is the start line for the half-marathon. You roll out of bed and there you are ready to run. 

The lobby is clean and smells nice. They have a fruit-Infused water, and iced tea station by the concierge. We had limited interaction with the staff so, I can't really say much about them. There's a restaurant and a coffee shop. We ordered room service one time we got hungry and didn't feel like moving. Really good garlic fries - loaded with fresh garlic! Yum!

Our room was standard. The only downside was you don't get a good view of the harbor and Stanley Park because of the hotel (we stayed at last year) across the street blocking the view. The bathroom was quite nice.

It is located in Downtown Vancouver where all the action is at. Lots of restaurants, shops, a museum, and businesses nearby. We had every intention to stop by the hotel gym but walking over 10mi per day, we just wanted to rest our tired feet. They have an ice machine on every odd numbered floor.

The breakfast buffet was the shining star of the stay!!! Superb doesn't begin to explain the options and excellence!!  The staff is very helpful and super kind.

There is a stairway from banquet goes down to hotel lobby, they decorated it with flowers, all very beautiful. 

The hotel staff is very helpful, no matter is when you need help to find the ways or you need a hand to carry your bags, they are very proactive and response request very fast. I would choose this place for our company event for future as well.",2019-11-06T05:38:47Z,189

2652,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"Excellent bellman. Excellent service at the bar. 

Here is the issue.
First, the three-person reservation in one room was not recognized until we checked to the front desk at 2 pm despite online reservation was made. The official check-in was 4 pm. But, the room was not ready at 4:30 pm, they tell us that they will call us.  The staff tells us that we only waited for 40 min. Yes, it is true from the official deadline. But, from my perspective, it was already, 2.5 hours. Of course, I am not complaining for about the initial two hours. 

In the end, we wonder the city until 6:30 pm. Of course, nobody calls us. They mention about mobile check-in but, it is just a poor excuse.

There are a multiple communication error and incompetence of the staff is my conclusion. The next problem is that nobody on the front desk apologizes. You get the perception that they do not care. Also, if you know that it is 3 person in the room at 2 pm why can you not start working from 2 pm. Not everybody checks in exactly at 4 pm. There is clearly a poor communication between the front desk and the cleaning people.

They can do much better-personalized care.",2019-07-23T02:30:21Z,189
2653,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"The Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle was a great place to stay.  The room was a bit small and slighty dated.  Nothing too fancy here, but the room was fine.  The check in process was great, they were expecting us since I had done the mobile check in.  The front desk was very hospitable and offered water to us, we must have looked very thirsty too which we were.  We had a great view of the harbour from our room.

The concierge lounge was a great place to stock up on snacks and drinks when it was open.  We were there at the weekend so they were only open for breakfast.  Luckily they were open at 6:30 since we had early morning plans.

This is probably more of a issue for myself.  The self parking downstairs is pretty scary.  I'm used to larger spots and more space to navigate around.  We had a larger car and we all ended up deciding to valet instead after almost not being stressed out finding a suitable parking spot.

We were walking distance to the olympic torch, the cruise docks, and near the marina.  There were also some other locations nearby, but we didn't find much to do in the immediate area.  Gastown is walkable but it's definitely a tad far.",2018-08-23T15:11:28Z,189

Check-in was genuinely pleasant while valet was efficient. We didn't take advantage of the pool, hot tub, sauna, or gym, but probably should have. One thing we did relish was the club lounge with breakfast and snacks. Room service is also available 24/7.

Room isn't the newest, but works well enough. Pool area is great for kids (indoor pool was somewhat heated; also a hot tub).

We asked for a minfridge and microwave ahead of time, and this was graciously set up ahead of time at no additional charge.

Spacious bathroom with both tub (great to kids) and a decently sized shower. Nice views with floor to ceiling windows, especially great for a corner room.

Not sure who's in charge of providing the complimentary apples in the fitness center, but I've never had better hotel apples. There was a light green apple variety (perhaps Mutsu, way better than tart Granny Smith) and a red/yellow apple (perhaps Ambrosia) - always fresh and crisp, we ate a lot of these!

2659,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"I booked the concierge level for my parents to celebrate their anniversary and my mom's birthday. I also booked another room since my aunt is in town.  I must say that I am not impressed at all.  First, when I called in to confirm my reservations, the person couldn't find it in the system. Took a few more minutes for it to be sorted out. Then I requested for a room with 2 doubles and she said that when I made my reservation, I booked 1 double bed.  Actually, the website says 2 doubles or 1 king. If it's just 1 double bed, I wouldn't check in at this hotel.

When we checked in, it was transactional and a bit cold.  There was a promo going on where they give you $100 visa and clearly, the terms say that you can apply it towards your room. But in this case, front desk  wouldn't let me apply it.  I know for a fact that other hotels have no problem applying this.  Then I was rushed through the check in process as there is a lineup. I also found out that the lounge service is not available during weekends. This was not clearly stated.  Why would I pay extra $100+ for breakfast?  We could have just gotten a nice breakfast somewhere else.  

Check in time is at 4pm which was later than other hotels in the area.  Although they did give us our room when we arrived at 3pm.  In room wifi has charge but if you are a Bonvoy member, they said they will reverse it. Hope they stick to their word when I check out tomorrow.

Amenities include pool, hot tub, steam room and sauna.  Gym was spacious and we'll equipped.  

It's nice of them to inform me that parking on weekends is cheaper at $7.50 if you don't move your car.  Other than that, compared to another 4 star hotel with which I recently stayed at, this is way underwhelming.  You don't feel welcomed and it's just a business transaction for them.  I regret staying here.",2019-12-22T05:32:22Z,189

The check-in process was very efficient and the rooms were comfortable but a little smaller and tighter than I expected. In town for a conference, most of my time was spent on the third floor in the conference rooms. They were well-maintained and the sound system worked well. Meals were catered by the hotel and everyone seemed to really enjoy them. 

The wi-fi works great in the lobby, in the hotel rooms, and in the conference rooms. There's a kiosk in the lobby to print boarding passes, which made things very convenient for those who prefer paper copies:

Stanely Park is about a 20 minute walk.  

The meals they were provided were excellent and they accommodated vegan and gluten free dietary restrictions. My meals for the two days included a chickpea avocado salad and a tofu Pad Thai. Both were very generous portions and pretty tasty (better than Catcus Club).  

They also have an okay sized gym for a hotel (it's rare for hotel gyms to have a pull up apparatus and a barbell - though it was a really small one).

The rooms are pretty nice. I was on the 30th floor with a view of the city. The beds were really comfortable and overall the hotel was pretty quiet. You can hear some of the doors closing from the hallway but it's not that bad. The water pressure from the sink and shower are great.

Upon check-in, we were given our king size room (luckily, they had just cleaned the room and there was one ready for us to move our luggage in). 
There's only FREE wi-fi in the downstairs lobby, but if you want wi-fi in your room - there's a charge. Bummer.

There is a lounge on the 25th floor that has some spectular views of the harbor, but unfortunately, it wasn't open during the hours we were there, so we didn't get to enjoy it.

Not to mention that the hotel room& bathroom were spotlessly clean and spacious with a harbor view, the front desk Elaine( not sure if I spell right) and room service staff Jisook made our stay in Pinnacle exceptional. Once Elaine/Jisook knew this trip is for my dad's special birthday treat, they tried their best to make our family stay in Pinnacle special. We felt so welcomed.
Thank you very much Mariott Vancouver Pinnacle again, this stay definitely made me feel good to be a Marriott member :) I will definitely come back and stay here whenever I visit Vancouver.",2017-08-21T23:33:58Z,189
2679,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"Beautiful hotel with great views. We only stayed one night, but had a great experience while there. The hotel had great customer service. We really enjoyed the views from the concierge lounge on the 25th floor. We also ordered room service which was delivered promptly. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because our TV was having volume issues. We did have someone from the staff come and completely switch the TV in our room, but the new tv they gave us was much smaller than the one originally in the room. Service was completed quickly though.",2018-06-06T00:08:04Z,189

Other than that, everything is great.",2017-04-07T23:48:44Z,189
2681,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"Loved this full service Marriott!! Awesome location walking distance to great shopping, restaurants, and the art gallery great. We rented a car and didn't even need it. It was so great to walk everywhere.  

My room had a beautiful view of the harbor. It was quite and clean. The housekeeping staff was great and very efficient. I didn't order room service, my co-worker did and he said it was good. I used the dry cleaning service and it was very quick and they did a great job. Front desk staff was very helpful and accommodating. 

The restaurant in the hotel was also quite good. 

I would definitely stay in this Marriott again!!!",2018-03-15T18:38:23Z,189
2682,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"Stayed here for one night during the weekend to just to have a little staycation and unwind.

Our room was on the 15th floor and an interesting part about this room is that its windows are curved so our room had somewhat of a panoramic view of the city (the TV cabinet was somewhat in the middle, but I didn't particularly mind). We even had a little view of the convention centre and the harbour, I would imagine the views would be spectacular in the rooms at the top of the hotel! 

The bed was definitely the highlight of the room! Normally I'd have to adjust into a new bed the first night when I travel, but I slept like a baby in this Marriott bed! 

The bathroom felt a little dated as it still had the traditional tan wallpaper you'd find in hotels from the 2000s. The space also had a separate shower and tub. However, this made both the tub and shower seem very small and cramped. Hopefully renos will be coming soon to the hotel!

Overall a great stay! Hopefully the hotel decides to make some renovations to spruce it up a little!",2017-03-29T09:36:59Z,189

2689,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"When I travel, 9 times out of 10, I find a hotel using Priceline. And when I use Priceline I always (seriously always) use the ""Name Your Own Price"" tool where you put where you want to stay, how much you want to pay and the star rating of a hotel and it's a gamble as to what hotel you'll get... and every single time I have done this in Vancouver, in the last 3 years, Priceline gives me the Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel! So I guess the Marriott Pinnacle is my YVR home away from home - and I am A-OK with that!! 

With fabulous ocean and city views, a truly spectacular location in the downtown side of Coal Harbour that is blocks from the Olympic Torches, Convention Centre, and Waterfront train station, I honestly love it. The rooms are spacious, clean, and very comfortable. The service is great. And the lobby bar has great happy hours! 

I definitely suggest staying here. Especially for tourists that want close, easy access to Stanley Park.",2016-04-12T04:42:24Z,189

What a wonderful way to experience the complete beauty of Vancouver, all while being fabulously close to the heart of restaurants, bars, shopping & nightlife.  Rooms are nice & comfy, not luxury by any means (bathrooms could def use upgrading) but overall quite nice, 4 stars.

3 stars (barely) for the common areas: concierge lounge, lobby, fitness center, which are well overdue for upgrading. Regardless, people like David at the front desk & Irene in the VIP concierge lounge made my stay awesome and I'll for sure be back!

Hint: ask for a high floor room ending in xx19, xx20 or xx21 for harbour views.  Fabulous.",2009-12-04T22:12:32Z,189
2691,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"With Vancouver being such a beautiful city, and people from all over the world coming to visit, sometimes it is nice to stay in your own city as a tourist and see what standards they live in to enjoy what we call home. Over the weekend I had the chance with my partner to stay an enjoy a night at this place. The 'star' ratings are what rates a place in the hotel industry, and on many sites this place ranks a good 4-Stars. The location is quite nice, down on West Hastings and Thurlow, and being in Vancouver, everything really is in walking distance. Unfortunately on this night we were faced toward the South view (if you get a chance try to get up and facing to the North - mountain/cauldron view!).

I can say I was not too impressed, for where it is located, and who is now the name of the building (as this used to be the Delta Pinnacle). It was a standard run-of-the-mill type room. The washroom itself was not too bad, with a tub, and right beside, a shower, and as a whole, pretty large. The room itself, with the king size bed, the words tight come to mind, as there is not much room to manuever. No fridge in-suite, so if you need anything refrigerated, like we did on this night, go down to the check-in desk and use the valet bag service.

The bed was pretty comfortable, as I had a pretty good sleep. Another thing to note is the a/c-heat unit, it is pretty loud, going on and off throughout the night, which is normal to regulate temperature, but it is noisy, and if you are a light sleeper, I have a feeling you will be waken up by this!

If you have a car, try parking somewhere else, as the lot rates here are upwards of past $20 for the day. The cheaper rate they tell you is one where you would have to drag yourself out of bed real early to move the car! If you are here on the weekend, go up a block or two, you can either find free parking, or parking a fraction of the cost.

Had a brief stroll of the gym, workout facilities, and they did use some money here, where all the equipment is new. A nice little touch here is that they provide fresh apples to hotel guest in the gym, and at the main lobby. Also most of the cardio machines have tv's, and they provide brand new (free of charge) ear phones for your disposal.

I booked through Priceline's ""Name Your Own Price"" and got this for around $90. Worth the price, but if it was the regular rate, I would have to pause on that thought.",2011-11-07T21:57:16Z,189
2692,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"I can't say enough about how much I loved this hotel.  The location is great.  A block or so away from the harbor; walking distance to Pacific Centre; etc.  

I was immediately greeted by the doorman (is that what they are called?).  I'd heard about Canadian hospitality, but wasn't expecting this.  I was helped at the front desk by Matija and Mary (her third day). They were extraordinarily accommodating and offered me a nice room upgrade that gave us a much better view.  The check-in process was quick, and I even got a cookie!  They answered my questions and pointed me in the right directions.  That same day, they sent up chocolate covered strawberries with a thank-you note.  Never had that happen before. 

The room was spectacular.  We had a view of the harbor and the west side of the city.  Our room was clean and there was plenty of room.  The bathroom was roomy and had a nice walk-in shower.  The conference rooms where our conference was were neat and they kept the ice water full (important!)!

The amenities at this hotel are second to none.  Full service bar and restaurant with fabulous employees.  When we come to Vancouver, this is where we're staying.",2017-05-24T01:17:55Z,189
2693,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"Nice hotel, nice location.  Stayed here for a cruise.  The hotel was clean.  Bellmen were super friendly.  We went to them for help since there was a long line at the concierge desk.  We did end up talking to the concierge too who helped us plan our day. 

The only hiccup was during checkin, they didn't have our reservation for the first night.  I showed our booking.com confirmation and they took care of us but gave a bit of a scare that we might not have a room that night. 

Advice: Don't pay extra for a harbor view room.  We made that mistake and our view was mostly city.  A slim sliver of the harbor could be seen if you press your face against the glass.

The restaurant in the lobby was good.",2019-07-14T15:43:00Z,189
2694,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"For the most part you have to go to nice cities to get hotels of this caliber. 
Vancouver is no exception and neither is the Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel. The building is gorgeous and the rooms match.
We stayed in an oversized room with a harbor view on the top floor. 
The bathroom was a good size which is sometimes an issue at Marriotts in the U.S. 

The lounge was a treat as it was open on Sunday for breakfast, as far as lounges go this was probably the best breakfast in a lounge that I have had.  

The hotel is within walking distance to downtown as well as to the cruise harbor and convention center - an excellent location.",2016-05-28T15:05:04Z,189
2695,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"I was staying on points, and the experience was still 4+ star. One reads about all the area hotels, and ""needing"" an upper floor, to get the 'best' views.  Well, really, is it that important?  Perhaps because I'm platinum, Michelle (most friendly and helpful) at the front desk upgraded me to a fantastic room (2519) which is both on the concierge level, and has a great view of the harbor.  So, yes, a view is a big plus in Vancouver.

The hotel staff was most helpful and friendly.  We utilized concierge services, restaurant, club level lounge, and business center. Caitlin in the Showcase restaurant/bar was teriffic.  Once she realized it was my wife's birthday, she sent up a card with chocolates and strawberries to our room, which were waiting for us following dinner at a nearby restaurant.  How sweet!!

The club level breakfasts were outstanding: eggs, salmon, pastries, fruit, yoghurt, etc., etc. And the staff were excellent!!

Concierge services from Malia and Josh are certainly adequate, but not very proactive or assertive on customer requests.  I don't know if it's the 'Canadian culture' or what.  But, if you are needing limo services, make sure you get the terms and contract in writing beforehand.  We had a major and unneccessary hassle following our limo experience, relative to the hours and billing!!!  Concierge should take heed for other patrons.

However, despite this ""blemish"" by the concierge, I give the hotel high marks, and would stay here again.",2012-09-03T19:34:26Z,189
2696,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"What a beautiful hotel!  We used ""name your own price"" on Priceline and snagged a king room on the 31st floor for just over $80.  The hotel is modern and gorgeous, and the staff were friendly and accommodating.  The room was fully appointed, with a luxurious king bed, nice sized flat screen TV, mini bar, large bathroom, sitting area, and a coffee maker.  There was also a very convenient charging station for phones and laptops.  The location is in the heart of downtown, just a couple of blocks to the waterfront, a 5-minute walk to shopping and dining on Robson street, and within a couple of blocks buses and the Skytrain.  There are also cabs ready and waiting in the front of the hotel.

What really made this hotel worth 5 stars, though, was the staff.  From the friendly doorman to the helpful and accommodating front desk staff, to the housekeeper who  brought us extra blankets after our chilly day in the rain...everyone just seemed to bend over backwards to make us feel like important guests.  We were sad that we could only stay one night.",2012-01-08T07:10:16Z,189
2697,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"This hotel is overall good in the busy expensive business area of Vancouver.
It's situated right next to many other high rise hotels and condos near the north harbor a few blocks from Canada Place.

why 2 stars? well, unless you get a good deal or priceline it the hotel is pretty expensive for what it is + they like to nickel and dime you.

hotel parking is absurdly expensive and they want $13 for in room internet access (there's a trick around it - log on to the net in the lobby and you can use the guest access # in your room for up to an hour).

also, their front desk did a big annoying mistake by not transferring a call to my room.

The room itself was good sized with proper amenities.

I called and they refused to book me for 2 nights saying they were ""sold out"" the following night. However when I looked online to find alternate arrangements I saw that there were many rooms available - they were just double my rate ($600+ per night). When I politely asked for the second night at my current rate they told me that was impossible because they were ""sold out"". But not for $600? Gouging and lying to your patrons. Nice.",2018-10-01T18:16:11Z,189

2701,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"Stayed here during the month of April.

Service is outstanding! From check in, to calling for service to the room... Everyone was absolutely pleasant, professional, and helpful... Even with stupid questions that an American like I had.

Very clean lobby, and nice rooms, where we had an awesome view on the 23rd floor. Weird, but I Base a lot of my opinion on a hotel room by judging the restroom. In this case, very mediocre, yet clean nonetheless. 

Free wifi in the lobby and restaurant, but you have to pay about $15/day for wifi in the room. 

The location is very central in the downtown financial district, easy to get taxi's and take a short  ride anywhere. It was approximately $40 for 4 people to get here from the airport. 

Oh, and a convenient, clean, classy bar/restaurant right in the lobby.

Definitely recommended.",2012-04-12T04:57:04Z,189
2702,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"A fantastic business hotel. The location at the harbour is perfect for any conference at the convention center and also very close to the attractions in the commercial area downtown. One thing I really liked about this hotel was that it was central but not chaotic. There wasn't a huge traffic jam outside everyday. The surrounding streets afforded the excitement of being in a metropolis without the frustration of being cramped and hustled. 

We upgraded to a harbour view room and I'm SO GRATEFUL we did. The room was not particularly large, but the views from the floor-to-ceiling windows were stunning. I spent a whole rainy afternoon in there myself, reading a book and listening to some music as I occasionally drank in the mountains of North Vancouver and the activity down at the harbour. Seaplanes coming in and out, huge Alaskan-bound cruiseships bellowing their sirens, the leaves changing colors just over the way at Stanley Park. It was breath-taking. The room itself was pretty flawless for a business traveler with a nice bathroom/shower, comfortable bed, large flatscreen TV and an ipod dock. 

Other positives to the hotel: with 28 floors you may think the elevator would be arduous. It wasn't! It was literally the most efficient elevator system I've experienced. Hooray. The fitness room was excellent and the pool area/hot tub/sauna were also nice touches. We used the fitness center the three days we were there and had no complaints, although watch out for the treadmills -- some of them clock distances in km, so you may think you're a superstar if you don't change it over to miles ;)

Negatives: sauna and steam room not working properly while we were there, the lobby's not very spacious and sort of backs up directly into the bar area, $15 a day for internet in rooms and no complimentary tea/coffee downstairs for guests. Otherwise, a lovely stay!",2013-10-07T17:25:03Z,189
2703,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"Overall great hotel and would come here again for next visit to Vancouver. 

From the beginning the valet was fantastic, making me and the wife feel comfortable and at home even despite the hotel being booked and chocked full of people. There was some Canadian festival or special holiday going on and the hotel was booked solid and busy. 

The lady who checked us in took the time to make us feel welcome and didn't make us feel rushed. That's what is missing from many other hotel chains where they rush to get you checked in and on to the next customer. The concierge lounge was closed cause it was Saturday but we were able to get a nice room upgrade due to our Marriott rewards status. (If you don't have a Marriott rewards membership, recommend you get one) 

Our room had a great view of the water and city. The bed is HEAVENLY. It was so soft... One of the better hotel beds around. 

Had breakfast in the hotel the next morning. Good was actually very good. They also had a buffet going on but we opted to order off the menu. Portions were huge and the omelette was very good. 

This place was only 2 blocks away from the waterfront and an extra block away from Canada Place.

Loved having the Keurig in the room, and the bathroom had a shower and a bath!! We did not have to wait long to check in, and our check-out we did via the express way via phone which made it very easy. Nice, large lobby as well, free wifi in the lobby...

Only issue is that the room wasn't ready at check-in...which is a little ridiculous for the price we paid. The service at the hotel made up for it, though.  I'd stay again.",2012-05-16T05:24:05Z,189
2710,Vancouver Marriott Pinnacle Downtown Hotel,4.1,"It is always a nice touch to receive some complimentary food and beverage amenity when staying along with a nice personal note from the manager. It says that they know how to treat their customers!

The rooms were on the smaller side, but that is pricey land values for you. Rooms had an awesome view of Burrard inlet and West/North Van, if it weren't for the low cloud ceiling. 

My room bug would be the closet that was so small that it wasn't too practical to hang stuff but I was here for only 2 nights. Keeping the closet door and bathroom door open meant opening both at the same time. Marriage made in Vancouver...

Breakfast were great between the omelet station to the cold and hot buffet items. Smoked salmon was a plus especially since we are in the  Pacific NW. It made for a nice respite from the cold outside and slight jet lag.",2013-12-12T00:36:33Z,189

The rooms are nice, but not over the top. It's definitely nice to have a good fridge in the room, and we used it. 

I am personally not a fan of these rooms with the completely clear bathroom. Don't worry, in the picture he was just sitting there to make a point, not doing anything that would be weird to photograph. . Luckily there is a shade, but I just don't need to see the bathroom that much, nor do I care to. Personal preference. 

The location is awesome! We were able to walk all around the area and there are some great restaurants and shops around. 

It's a little pricey in my opinion for what it is, and we didn't have the best view (we looked at another hotel, and an alleyway) but it might also be the time of year we were there.

The room had a King size bed, an awesome stand alone glass shower with rain shower head and hand held attachment. They have shampoo, conditioner and shower gel in large pump sizes.

2717,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"Booked this place after doing weeks of research and finding it at a great price. 

Was a little less than a 10 minute walk away from the Vancouver City Centre Skytrain stop. We were greeted by who I believe was the concierge and the manager, Min. Min was super friendly and accommodating and probably the best part of our hotel stay because of how helpful she was for us. She helped us get around, called a cab for us, and overall the nicest person we met.

The room we were assigned was what appeared to be a queen bed suite. The room was super nice and spacious. The hardwood floors are nice and there was also a terrace with a great view of BC Place. 

The bed was sort of uncomfortable and we got a little back pain after a few nights sleep. Another thing that wasn't so great was the shower since there was no tub for the shower a lot of water was able to get onto the bathroom floor. This may have been a handicap accessible room though so it's understandable. One of the least favorite parts of our stay was the breakfast. Not because the food was bad but we did not know that we would be charged or how much it was until after leaving the room. We were honestly just looking to check it out at first.

Overall, the hotel was beautiful and the staff was wonderful but there was something things that could improve. Definitely can see why it is a top hotel downtown.",2019-10-23T01:53:56Z,80
2718,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"This has become my go-to place in Vancouver.

Location is extremely convenient, just close enough to downtown businesses and restaurants to be able to walk everywhere, but just far enough that you feel a bit isolated from the worst of the city noise. The neighborhood can be busy when there's an event at BC Place.

All the rooms are well appointed. the balcony rooms and suites are especially nice in good weather. Beds are comfortable and all the right bits are there: refrigerator, microwave, decent bathroom amenities. Most rooms do not have a tub, but this has never been a issue for me. Bathrooms are glassed-in, but a curtain provides privacy. I'd characterize this place as better for adults than families.

The upper levels of the building are condos, and access to the hotel floors is controlled with key-card access from the elevator, so you will need to go downstairs to admit guests and/or receive food delivery.

The pool is nice, and covered in winter so it's always usable. Breakfast (additional cost) is good and can save you the trouble of going out on rainy days.

One of the major benefits to me is that if you have premium status on HotelsDotCom and ExpediaDotCom you get free parking and free room upgrades when available. As I'm usually driving from Seattle saving the normal Vancouver parking cost is worth at least $30 a night and the inconvenience of parking offsite. The free room upgrades have often found me in a 2-level suite or balcony room.",2021-07-16T18:51:35Z,80

Hotels can be super expensive in certain areas of Vancouver.  Luckily, I found Hotel BLU and had a great rate.  True, it's not ""central"" to a lot of locations.  However, it's not a far walk to get around to many great shops and restaurants.  The hotel itself is very modern.  While the lobby had some construction going on, it was very clean.  The parking is underground (and gated) and can be accessed with your hotel key.  The room itself is very nice, spacious, and has all the amenities you could possible need.  There is a pool and gym on the 2nd floor and both were kept in good condition.  Speaking of gyms, does anybody find it weird that I watch Food Network while on the treadmill or elliptical machine?!?  I mean, you gotta put the calories back somehow!

As for service, top notch.  I already love going to Canada, but this place makes it even better.  My kids love it, too, because they gave them some snacks for the road!  Thanks, Hotel BLU!",2019-07-11T00:49:34Z,80

The bed is incredibly comfortable. The showers are a bit interesting as you can see through them from the bed to the bathroom. There's an optional shade you can pull down. Not all rooms are like this but just a heads up! Haha

They also have complimentary yoga classes in the mornings you just have to ask which day because it varies.

The staff is super friendly and accommodating. Plus they have a virtual assistant named Roxy in each room and you can ask her for things like directions, general hotel questions, the weather, to call your car from valet... It's super cool! I used the last request quite a bit :)",2019-02-09T16:39:00Z,80
2722,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"FancyPants! Wonderful stay!

After spending a week in the Canadian Rockies, we headed to Vancouver for a little pampering and city life.  We splurged slightly and stayed at the Hotel Blu Vancouver.  The hotel did not disappoint!

Another review mentioned the USB next to the bed didn't work, which we also experienced.  I had thought we missed a switch somewhere, but there were plenty of outlets and other USB options for charging our devices in the room, just slightly less convenient.  

The location is excellent, great spot to walk almost anywhere.  We even walked to the beach from the hotel (it's about a mile, but fun to stroll through the neighborhoods).  It's located right next to the stadium on Robson, which makes it easy to locate from almost anywhere.   

Staff were super friendly, helpful, and nice.  The technology in the hotel is really great too - they have a 'virtual assistant' similar to Alexa/Siri whom you can ask the weather, dining suggestions, etc - but who is also hooked into the Hotels system, and you're able to get things like towels sent up, or your car pulled around from the garage.  They also have a texting number, you can text the front desk for any of these issues. Finally a hotel in the #21stcentury!

The room, hallways, and lobby are all very swanky. Plush carpets, thick doors, nice soaps in the bathroom, high quality bedding, etc.  It was a delight to spend 3 nights here, we loved it!  There were plenty of in-room amenities including an Nespresso machine (which I LOVE). Normally, we don't ever touch coffee machines in hotels, but we felt comfortable using this one. They dutifully replaced our dirty cups and gave us more pods each time they cleaned our room.  There's a gym and an indoor pool; we didn't use either but checked them out, and they looked nice. The hotel also doubles as a residence, which I would personally dislike as a resident - but as a hotel guest, doesn't really make a difference. 

We had free parking, as part of our reservation, we were able to grab our car, and have it parked for us many times during the three nights we stayed here.

Overall a great stay, and for the I quality of the hotel, I think the price was a pretty great!",2018-09-22T11:47:39Z,80
2723,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"This is a great place to sat when you wanna watch a game. The stadium is close, within walking distance of the main gate. There are plenty of excellent restaurants nearby. 

They have valet or regular parking but do charge a parking fee of around 30$ per day. This was expected as we have stayed in Vancouver before and was charged a similar rate. 

There is a nice sized gym with well running machines. The pool is very nice, with a hot tub and a sauna. 

I would highly recommend paying for the hotel breakfast as we missed out on this but walked by and was absolutely shocked at the spread. It looked delicious. However there is a very quaint little breakfast place not far up the street that has AMaZing waffles.

Only downer was our mattress in our room. It did need to be changed out. It had two nice sized valleys that were unpleasant. The rest of our family did not report the same issue, so I assume our room was due for an updated mattress.

It's so central! The walk to gastown, chinatown, and downtown was pleasant (minus the rain), and it's so close to the skytrain! 

Guys... they had an organic bin in the room!! I loved this! Usually at a hotel I collect my organics in the fridge and toss them when I get home, but this was SO NICE! AND!! They had large bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash instead of the small, take-home, single-use bottles! Yay!

Free, fast wifi, and free bike rental and hotel shuttle! Although, I only found out about these from another review, I was NOT told about them from the hotel staff.

I wish I'd known about asking for better pillows... the ones on the bed were very difficult for me to sleep on, but I won't fault the hotel since I found out on the day I checked out that there are softer pillows in the closet, and you can ask for more at the desk. 

Pricey but worth it. A very luxurious hotel",2019-11-18T08:52:12Z,80
2728,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"I loved my stay here. Top notch friendly, professional staff always responsive to questions, requests, whatever you need whether it is an umbrella, hotel shuttle about town, chocolates, or free oyster coupons (thank you Min!). Clean, quiet rooms, design is very urban contemporary cool with nice attention to detail. Rooms are on the small side with a big, comfy bed. High quality HD TV, Nespresso coffeemaker, fridge, microwave. Wonderful hot tub, pool, sauna and fitness center too. Location is excellent, close to everything hip and cool in fabulous Vancouver.

No complaints but a word of warning to anyone whose travel partner might be a prankster. The bathroom design is a little weird. I'm posting a photo to illustrate, but there is a huge transparent glass window separating the bathroom and bedroom. The shower is big and very cool, but both it and the toilet are like a fishbowl in full view of the bedroom. Yes, there's an opaque shade that can be pulled to block the window but the shade is outside the bathroom! So the person on the toilet or in the shower has no control over their own privacy if they're on the throne. That plus the light switch is also outside the bathroom door. If you travel with a practical joker or a teenage boy, do not stay here! But if you travel alone or with a respectful adult partner, you will love it here. I do wish they'd change that odd design quirk though. 

Regardless, I hope to be back soon! Great hotel stay, thank you!",2017-01-21T05:14:55Z,80

You have the option of self or valet parking (both $30 CAD/day) but with valet, you should factor in tip. Parking was plentiful and there are elevators that go directly from the garage to your floor.

The room was clean and the shower is hilarious. It's glass all around with an optional pull-down curtain. 

The only problem we had was with the key cards. They would randomly deactivate so we'd have to go to the front desk to get it reactivated in order to access the elevators and the parking garage.

2730,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"4.25 Stars

I was very pleased with my stay at HotelBlu.  It is in Yaletown, which felt like a very new part of the city with glass skyscrapers.  Step outside the main door and blocks of restaurants are right there, any type of food you fancy.  You can easily walk to the water taxis that take you to Granville Island.

Our room was huge.  (We had just gotten off a cruise and lived in a 214s.f. room).  It felt luxurious to have space.  My family used the Nespresso machine like crazy.  House keeping gave us extra pods for our stay.  (Housekeeping was very friendly with big smiles.)  We also utilized the refrigerator to store snacks, cheese and yogurt.  This saved us the hassle and expense of running out for breakfast first thing in the morning when our 3 year old wakes up at the crack of dawn.

I used the gym each day.  It is a mediocre gym.  The equipment is adequate, but certainly not the quality of high end gyms.  For instance, the elliptical machine did not have the upper body function.  My main gripe about the gym is that they only had cleaning wipes on my 1st day here.  They were out both my 2nd and 3rd stay here despite me going to the front desk specifically to address this issue.

We used the pool daily.  It is tiny and really only meant for one family.  Luckily for us, we were the one family.  We had the pool to ourselves each time.

The beds were very comfortable.  I slept well.  I echo several of the reviewers that mention the completely see through bathroom wall that requires the roll down shade for any privacy.  

The main reason this is NOT a 5 star review is that the noise from the hallway comes right in through the flimsy front door.  I heard nothing above, below, or to my sides, but if anyone was in the hallway I could hear everything.  If someone is loud in the middle of the night, they could definitely wake you up.  This was my main gripe with this hotel.  In stark contrast my cruise ship room was almost sound tight.

The font desk was superbly courteous and professional.  They also provided a free shuttle which my family utilized twice.  

Bottom Line:  I would stay here again since I sleep with ear plugs and bring a sound machine when I travel.  I love the location and the hotel room was very nice.",2016-06-09T03:05:34Z,80

2732,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"This place was amazing in every way. Location, rooms, amenities, service. 

Location:
It is a 10min drive to Granville island, Stanley park and Gastown. Want to shop or go grab a quick bite, just walk down Robson street. 

Rooms: 
Such a stylish room! Wood floors, chic decor, pretty view. 

Amenities: 
Man oh man, where do I start? Fancy espresso machine with bomb coffee. Hit water kettle to make tea. Makeup wipes incase you forgot your makeup remover. Nice big bottles of shampoo, conditioner and bath wash. Umbrellas in each room incase you didn't look up the weather and forgot yours at home. Spa robes and slippers. Free rental bikes to ride to Stanley park. Free parking. Refrigerator where you can actually put your food in as opposed to those useless fridges with alcohol and chocolates that are on a sensor. Microwave to heat up your leftovers. 
Decent pool, hot tub, sauna and exercise room. 


Service: 
They were so friendly at the front desk. When we called housekeeping a couple times to help us out with the espresso machine and bring up some plates, they were there within 5 minutes. 

In the end:
I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Vancouver. Wish hotels in Los Angeles and Las Vegas took a class from Hotel Blu on service and amenities.",2016-01-30T18:39:01Z,80

2735,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"We had an extended stay recently in Vancouver and stayed at this boutique hotel on Robson by the stadium, on the cusp of Yaletown and downtown. Super convenient location to walk anywhere: Yaletown, downtown, waterfront, Gastown, even Coal Harbour. And the hotel itself was terrific - so much so that we plan to stay here again! But it was not without its (minor) downfalls:

-as others have mentioned, both my husband and I had issues with our room keys deactivating. It happened almost daily, to his or my keycard, or both. These cards activate the elevators and the parking garage door gate, as well as our hotel room door, so this regularly-occurring ""quirk"" was super inconvenient.
-wow, there is no insulation at all between the hallways and one's room. We heard other doors closing (sounded like slamming!) and people talking loudly (even if they weren't loud, it sounded like they were!). Luckily we are early wakers in the morning, but we were surprised how loud sounds from the hallway were. 
-we had a few little issues upon check-in (all were resolved, but still, we were surprised they occurred): we were early and our room wasn't ready. Front desk told us to return by 3pm when room would be ready (that's the usual check-in time) but they'd call us if it was ready before then. We didn't get a call but returned by 4:30pm and still, front desk had to make a few calls to housekeeping to see if our room was ready. We had to wait about 10-15 minutes, all luggage and coats in tow, at the front desk, while waiting to see if the room was ready. Finally we were told the room WAS ready and up we went. There we discovered that the door's deadbolt didn't lock (the deadbolt ""hole"" in the door frame didn't align with the actual deadbolt in the door!). After a call downstairs and another 40 minute wait, we were re-located to another room. Yikes.
-a big deal is made online about this hotel's techie bonuses like the in-room iPad and alarm clock/Bluetooth music dock stand and more. Well, the iPad in our room didn't work (kept freezing), and the alarm clock didn't work. The room's Nespresso coffee machine worked for my kid but stopped working for me (insert sad face here!). So... tech stuff is spotty.

The good stuff:
-the room/s were spotless and well-apportioned, the shower was the best hotel shower all of us have ever experienced, we loved the bathrooms, the towels and bathrobes were really plush, they provide slippers and umbrellas in the room, and the beds were super comfortable.
-loved the fact they had a safe in the room. So many hotels nowadays don't.
-we loved the lobby with the hanging blue ball lights and the hotel façade with the blue-lit trees. Front desk staff are friendly and there's a big basket of apples for the taking, if you want.
-Nice but small work-out room and pool. Clean.
-The parking garage was the best hotel parking garage we've used in Vancouver: well-lit, large spots, easy to navigate. Felt very safe and secure and was super clean. Really nice!
-we got a good deal on Expedia for this hotel and because I use Expedia a lot, parking was included. Bonus!
-check-out was smooth and easy and surprise-free. I even was allowed an extended late check-out if I needed it. Bonus again!

All in all, despite the quirks, this hotel was lovely. We definitely will stay here again.",2017-03-04T04:58:19Z,80
2736,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"MMM, Not sure how this hotel has 4 stars on yelp. It's really not that great of a hotel. We got stuck on the 3rd floor room 313. Our floor smelled like chlorine, probably because the pool is on the second floor or something, but it was REALLY bad.

When we got to our room it looked clean, but then I pulled the blankets to see if it was clean and there was hair, everywhere. IT WAS REALLY GROSS. Like super gross. There was hair on our pillow, comforter, just everywhere.

I called front desk and they changed the sheets for us, no sorry no nothing. I def will NOT be back here.",2018-01-12T20:32:48Z,80
2737,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"It's a nice hotel in Downtown Vancouver and walking distance to many restaurants. The room itself was nice, we stayed at the ""loft"" room which is a little peculiar as it has only the bed on a second story that you can access via a narrow staircase in the room. No closet space on the second story or really any room, only a bed and tv.

While the room I would say is above average, the most infuriating and frustrating part of the stay here were the room keys and elevator system. Because part of the hotel is condos with residents, everything needs a key: doors, elevators, parking garage, etc. 

The keys seem to stop working after a couple of hours and while you could get into your room, you couldn't use the elevator. You could call for it (without a key), get in, the door will close behind you, but then you'd be stuck in the elevator. The elevator would randomly shoot up and down as you furiously tap the key reader with your key and scream obscenities at it while this metal box held you hostage while going to different floors.

At first we thought it was us, but no the front desk staff told us ""it happens"" and gave us a new key. Still the same issue happens with the new key. As a traveler you're tired, and the last thing you want to do is fight with an elevator and have even trouble getting in or leaving the place. The problem became so intolerable that an employee gave us their key at the third key exchange, and this is all in a one night stay! Even their parking garage, the front desk staff helpfully told us the keys only scan in once and then afterwards it won't scan again and they don't know how to fix it. We were even talking amongst ourselves counting the number of keys we had and how many times we could re-entry to the parking garage because of this.

In all, it was a nice place, but management is terrible to let guests deal with a faulty key system when all I want to do is sleep. Other reviews also kind of allude to the key problem as well. 

On another note, I left an item in the room and called the hotel 3 times over 3 days to ask about it as we'd be passing by Vancouver on the way back to the airport and I could pick it up. They finally called me back on the fourth day when I was at the airport, and by then I had already dismissed this hotel as I knew I'd never go back.",2017-01-23T04:14:46Z,80

The bathroom had a life of its own since it's the main attraction to the room but once you pull the curtain down you got use to it. The only draw back was that the shower didn't have anywhere to hold onto so it made things a little tricky. The staff was all very helpful and very friendly checking in and out was very easy and fast. Really liked the fact that they always offered cold lemon cucumber water and green apples in the lobby and they also rent bikes to the guest at no charge (while supplies last of course) This hotel made my stay in beautiful Canda that much more special!",2017-01-23T22:45:47Z,80

2740,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"Was surprised with a return trip home after being away for 2 years. I was excited to stay at this hotel because of it's green claims. 

There was nothing extrinsically green about the hotel. 

The room was fine - we stayed in #203 a loft suite. The washroom has a glass wall in the shower with an outside control for a shade. Kind of weird but it worked for privacy. 

The patio area was prison cell-like with no decor/greenery on it and a couple of sad chairs and a table. 

Furnishings of the room were new (the hotel is new), power curtains etc...washroom located on main floor, bedroom in loft. Kind of a dicey walk when you are 1/2 asleep in a new place however there is a lighted floor area (which will keep you up all night if you are sensitive to light). Also, the phone beside the bed stays lit up with a giant LED panel or something - had to unplug it after the first night to get some actual sleep. 

Gym, pool, laundry and breakfast area located on the same floor as the loft suites - weird layout to have the expensive suites in a high-traffic area but you couldn't hear any hallway noises while we were there anyway. 

Gym was fine. 2 treadmills, 2 bikes (low quality) 2 benches, a mash of free weights and some mats/weighted balls. All were clean and in ok condition but the universal machine was dedicated to too many functions so it was really janky to work read: if you lift, you'll be frustrated. 

Breakfast was just ok, felt like they didn't have enough food out and the way the portions were doled out on the banquet table made you feel like you shouldn't eat too much, that was $40 pp. 

Central location, stones throw to both stadiums. 

We rented bikes (free) and toured the city one day - that was a plus for sure.

2742,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"I love this hotel! We stayed here for a week and it's safe to say that we will be staying here in the future.

Pros:
- Incredibly out-of-this-world friendly, accommodating staff that feel like friends and family and will always help you with anything you might need, or directions anywhere!
- Spacious, clean rooms with a nice view.
- Modern amenities and a nice in-room version of Alexa who helps you with all kinds of hotel and trip-related things (we asked her, ""what's for dinner?"" and she had great recs).
- Free bike rental! This is amazing, I can't say enough about this. They let us borrow bikes to ride around the entire city all day. You can reserve them in advance.
- A shuttle will take you anywhere downtown if you let them know (sooner the better). (One way trip.)
- Free in-room Nespresso pods!
- Free fast wi-fi! 
- Convenient location, close to delicious food, convenient markets, right across the street from Rogers Stadium.
- Just some really small lovely touches like incense, free apples, and fruit/mint infused water in the lobby.

Things I would love to see improved:
- There is an awkward curtain separating the clear glass shower wall from the rest of the room but it's operated from the outside! I wonder if kids stay here and they prank each other by raising it. That would suck and be embarrassing
- The hotel body wash gave me a fairly bad rash everywhere, I had to buy a bar of soap from H-Mart. I do like that they are refillable bottles rather than single-use plastic, however.
- I would love a small rack or shelf inside the shower to hold things like a shower cap, razor, non-rashy soap, etc. There was nowhere to put those things.

The shower was great the waterfall felling was great and the window glass shower was interesting. The Wood floor in the room wasn't comfortable but they also supplied slippers. But bed was so comfortable you can lose yourself

2744,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"Hotel Blu was a great hotel to stay at. The rooms were nice, the staff was incredibly polite and the location was perfectly situated in the heart of many restaurants and sights, but not in the middle of the busiest part of the city. There were some days I was bummed we were so far from the other side of the city, but it's not THAT far of a walk and it's fairly close to the trains. (We were able to walk to and from the trains to the airport with our luggage and everything).

I was quite impressed by the hard floors in the rooms. As a mild germophobe I was put at ease with the cleanliness of the flooring. The downside of this was that parts of the hallway were also hard flooring and although there was carpet through the center of the hall, people's voices carried as they walked through, making the hallway a little noisy.

The only thing I wasn't totally impressed with was breakfast. The spread felt small because they try to put out only what they need to at the time to make sure everything stays fresh, but it made me feel like there were fewer options than I really had. That being said, the staff monitoring the hotel breakfast was FANTASTIC. The lady working the buffet knew ALL of the returning guests' breakfast drinks when they waked through the door. She was a gem!

Overall I really liked the hotel and the value of what they offer to their customers. I would totally stay here again.",2014-10-23T23:01:04Z,80
2745,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"Had a very nice two night stay at HotelBLU, the location and amenities at the price could not be beat in YVR. With the CAD = USD conversation rate in my favor, it was luxe hotel on a minimal budget.

Front desk staff was young and fun, yet helpful and competent. The US to Canada phone situation is sometimes tricky and they were always willing to call a cab or provide the Wifi code one more time. 

My room was pretty large with a King sized bed and, quite possibly, the softest sheets I've slept on in awhile. Had I not been visiting Vancouver for work, it would've been a special treat to sleep in and enjoy a few extra hours of slumber. But hey, more reason to return!

Though I don't love the in-room ""sexy shower"" (you know, the kind where it's clear glass facing the bedroom?) it's fine when traveling alone. This could get awkward if you were traveling with your parents or a non-significant other. Note: there is a shade on the room facing side of the shower so you could have a little privacy... but not much.

Would definitely recommend HotelBLU to other travelers looking for a reputable hotel centrally located and affordable. And you never know, I might be back sometime soon?",2016-02-02T22:53:53Z,80
2746,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"Don't stay here unless you want all your money tied up for 3-5 business days. The hotel pre-authorized our Visa card that my husband used to book the room online with the cost of our full stay plus about $300(US) more as a security deposit for each day of our 3 night stay. Then when we gave them a different card for incidentals at check in, they charged our other card for the full amount of our stay as a pre-authorization as well. Our front desk clerk indicated that it would be 3-5 business days before one of those charges dropped off, meaning the hotel has tied up over $900 for several days of our vacation for no reason. If you've already authorized that the funds were available on one card, why would it be necessary to pre-authorize our entire stay on a card that was only intended for incidentals?

The staff simply responded by thanking us for understanding (we don't) and telling us that sometimes this happens if you give a different card at check in. This is the only hotel I've ever stayed in in Canada, the US or any other country that has ever required a security deposit for each day of stay and that cannot accommodate the simple task of using a different credit card for incidentals. Additionally, if this is a known problem, it should have been made clear to us when we attempted to use a different card at check in. 

The room was nice. The staff was underwhelming. They didn't seem particularly knowledgeable about the area.  We checked out bikes from the hotel and asked for information about the best way to get to the sea wall for a ride.  The clerk simply printed out google maps and pointed at it incorrectly while trying to tell me where to go. While that route may have been the fastest, it was certainly not the safest or best, as it had us riding on very busy streets downtown. 

While the room is trendy and pretty, I'd move along and stay somewhere with better service if you're coming to Vancouver.",2016-05-13T16:23:47Z,80
2747,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"This place was FANTASTIC in many ways.. 

*I like that it was on a street that was walking distance to lots of restaurants.
**I LOVE that the floors were wood, or faux wood, NOT carpet. Carpet in a hotel room is just disgusting. I mean, what is on that carpet, anyway??
***What are the PERKS of the room? 
1- A Nespresso machine w/ pods. Can you say ""Deliscious Espresso"" anytime yopu want it?? I asked for some extra pods and I got them without question.
2- Fridge.
3- Microwave.
4- A robe and slippers.
5- A nice pool, Jacuzzi, sauna and small basic gym.
6- A tablet in the room, and a business center with a printer.
7- Cool bed lights with a tiny little reader light. 
*It was next to the soccer stadium, something to think about if you are going to go to a game.

2751,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"Excellent hotel for service and staff. Everyone was helpful and friendly. I gave the hotel 3 stars for a number of reasons.  

For one thing, the heating system in our loft could have been better - while the downstairs portion kept a cool 67 degrees, the upstairs felt like a sauna and it was hard to sleep comfortably in the hot night. 

The other reason is because the room wasn't very sound proof. At some point, it sounded like there were people sitting on our terrace - every word and laughter could be heard at 1:00 in the morning; every door being opened and shut could be heard. 

The other strange part of the room was that there were roll up shades that covered the bathroom floor to ceiling window and the shades were controlled on the outside of the bathroom. Weird. Which meant that at anytime, any of your traveling mates could roll up or move the shades and peer into the bathroom whilst you're in there. Again, I say ""weird!"" Seriously, why do I want someone to peek in while I'm doing a #2?

Did I mention though that the staff was very cordial and helpful? For that reason, I would consider staying here again. The hotel was close to a lot of good shopping and it was sort of ""out of the way"" of heavy traffic. It was also in good proximity to different modes of transportation. And it had a great shuttle service that took you to various interest points in the city - it just didn't pick you up from there.",2016-04-05T01:45:42Z,80
2752,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"Normally when we travel we'll stay at the Marriott or some other known place. You know what to expect, right? Well, the bf made an excellent call and chose to stay at a boutique hotel during our trip to Vancouver. As soon as we walked in I was immediately impressed. The lobby was very sleek with clean lines and as soon as we walked in we were immediately greeted with fresh squeezed orange juice. Whaaaaat?! The girl that checked us in was super cool and nice which made a great first impression. 

We walked to the elevator and the bf told me that Hotel Blu is comprised of a hotel and residences. Man, if I could live here I certainly would. I can only imagine how the residences look.

When we walked in our room I was super impressed by how clean it was and how it didn't have that dank hotel smell. One thing that we didn't know was that you can see inside the bathroom from the bedroom. So hopefully you're super comfortable with the person you're staying with. If not, you're about to get comfortable:) Just kidding, there's a shade that you can pull down for privacy. The bed was beyond comfy. Let's just say I almost said, ""Ehhh we don't need to see the city. We can just lay here all day"". On top of all that there was an iPad in the room which came in handy to search Yelp for great restaurants and bars. AND, you're able to take the iPad outside of the room as if it's your own. I KNOW, RIGHT?! Just don't lose it. You will have to pay to replace it. The last part for me which assured me I'll stay here again if I ever return to Vancouver was that they provided makeup remover in the bathroom. I was so excited about this because I was way too *ahem* unavailable to dig through my luggage and fish for my makeup remover. Right on, Hotel Blu. Lastly, I have to mention the spa water in the lobby. Seriously, they thought of everything. I would suggest or recommend you stay here but if you haven't decided to after reading this review I don't know what else to tell you.",2015-06-10T04:41:49Z,80
2753,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,Nice hotel. Clean room and comfortable bed. Every morning by 8 AM we were awake from the people in the hall including the maids. Don't come here for the pool or hot tub-not too impressive.,2018-08-02T22:19:55Z,80
2754,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"Staff is awesome! 
Hopefully you will be waited on by Min or Julie. The room was nice. The only draw back was you can hear people slamming doors. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom was nice. Overall, our stay was great. I tried the breakfast buffet at the azure on the 2 floor. It wasn't really a buffet. The food was ok but for $21.00 your better off going to the pub around the corner. 
There is a coffee house across the street if you want something other than Starbucks. If you want a good steak The Keg is the place to go. Very nice atmosphere. Ask for the rooftop and Gemma as your server! She was great. All and all out stay was wonderful. We will be coming back to see more of Vancouver. Thank Hotel Blu for a wonderful experience. On the way to Whistler.",2016-07-03T18:54:54Z,80
2755,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"Hard to say whether or not I would stay here again. I absolutely LOVED the modern look of the room - whoever they hired as an interior designer did a terrific job. I also felt super posh in the incredibly cozy, high quality King sized bed. Also, the location is great and I found a few good restaurants in walking distance.

Here are my major beefs though, and why I probably won't come back:

1. You could hear everything through the door. I had a hard time falling asleep one night when some raucous partiers came back to the hotel around midnight, and was woken up early the next day by the cleaning staff, who sounded like they were inside my room. The door also had a ton of light coming through, which was distracting.

2. No room service! Boo!!! When I travel for work, sometimes I like to get room service in the morning so I can power through my work before heading out for meetings. Although grabbing a quick bite at Starbucks isn't that hard, it robbed me of 20 extra minutes I could have spent working.

So, all in all, I feel ambivalent about HotelBLU. I will probably keep trying to find Vancouver's best hotel.",2015-05-27T21:45:41Z,80
2756,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"This is my new favourite place to stay in Vancouver! The rooms were tasteful decorated and a good size. Comfortable beds. Gorgeous rain shower. Courteous and helpful staff. Well equipped gym. Decent pool, hot tub and sauna. It's obviously well cared. The breakfast buffet is outstanding! It's very close to lots of good restaurants, yaletown and the theatre. 
The only downside for me is it's about 10 minutes from the sky train. So tiny inconvenience.
I will definitely stay here next time I'm in town.",2018-05-09T15:34:46Z,80
2757,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"It was such a lovely weekend staying at this hotel. It has this modern & classy feel to it. The room was absoutely gorgeous, with a balcony. I loved how the room had a microwave & empty refrigerator. I would definitely come back again.

My boyfriend booked this through this app called hotel tonight.

We spent a little time in the hot tub, the pool is small so it's not possible to swim laps. We didn't get a chance to use the fitness room, but it looked clean and equipped.

It's walking distance to Robson Street and there's plenty of restaurants and places to eat nearby.",2014-10-07T00:30:47Z,80
2758,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,Fatantastic breakfasts. Very unique and healthful choices with great service. Breakfasts alone are good reason to stay at this hotel.,2016-10-11T13:47:55Z,80
2759,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"Pleasant rooms & fair amenities, but the service needs work.

Like other reviewers I was intrigued by this new hotel, and my wife and I decided to try it out for a recent 2-night visit to Vancouver.   My highest scores go to the room's *very* comfortable bed and stylish appointments.   (Although that display screen on the phone really is absurdly bright - we needed to cover it to sleep.)  I enjoyed the sauna and hot tub, although the latter would have been better had the water jets been working.   Since our room was near the end of a hall it was quiet (but note - be sure to ask for a room away from the ice machine, which is noisy and not in a closed room).

As is often the case with newer hotels, though, most of the staff doesn't seem to grasp that service is what separates the better establishments from the also-rans.   A few cases in point:

1.  ""Hi.  Has anyone left a message for me today?""   ""Let me look... no... oh, well except for this note on your reservation.   Your friend called so say they're delayed by 2 hours and won't be here to meet you.""   ""I see... any idea why I wasn't given that message when I checked in?   Before I wasted a couple of taxi fares trying to find them?""   (Desk clerk shrugs.)

2.  ""Hi, we need a drink, where's the hotel's bar?""   ""We don't have a bar.""   ""Oh...  (surprised silence...)  Well, what would you recommend that's nearby?""   ""Uh, just walk up Robson, there are lots of bars and restaurants.""   ""Gee, thanks for the tip.""

3.  ""Hi, we're looking for a recommendation for dinner.""  ""Well, if you just walk up Robson there are lots of restaurants...""  ""OK, never mind.""  

I won't go into detail about the taxi fiasco that ensued later... suffice to say that the place is nice enough, but next time I'll go to a hotel that I know has a better service orientation.",2015-08-18T22:34:42Z,80
2760,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"We stayed here for MLK day weekend on a Living Social deal. We loved the modern feel to the hotel, the concierge was helpful, and overall we really enjoyed our stay! 

The room is very modern with wood floors and all new furnishings. The bathroom with the glass window proved interesting, and a unique feature I haven't seen in other hotels. I'm glad they installed a curtain that can be closed for privacy. We noticed on our second night that we could hear a lot of noise from the hallway, and would not recommend this hotel for light sleepers. Hotel Blu did contact me to let me know that they are installing door sweepers to help reduce the noise level.

The breakfast was pretty decent for a hotel breakfast. Their Green Genius smoothie by far was the best thing there. 

We used the pool our second night, and found that we had it all to ourselves! We really enjoyed rotating through the hot tub, sauna, and pool. Careful with the sauna door though: if you grasp the handle from the inside and push forward, it will smash your fingers between the handle and the door frame. Ouch! 

With another living social deal, we would probably give Hotel Blu another try.",2015-01-23T22:53:55Z,80

I thought the glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom was odd at first but there is a curtain there that can be pulled down for privacy.  The hotel also has a pool, a spa, a sauna, a fitness room, and a sun deck.  Their premium breakfast buffet was delicious.  The location of the hotel is ideal.  It's within walking distance of the stadium, the casino, Chinatown, Gastown, and the bars/clubs of Yaletown.   There is a water taxi stop by the casino that took us to Granville Island and Vanier Park.   The hotel even provided us with complimentary bikes, locks, and helmets, to use for the day.

They did provide a Samsung Galaxy Pad, which I was able to USB plug into the TV, log into Netflix, and then with some time investment, found how to mirror the Galaxy onto the TV.

The bathroom was amazing with a deep soaker tub. The bedroom up the stairs was huge and comfy. Extremely nice finishes right down to the electric controls for the curtains a on the two story high windows. There was even a little patio surrounded by plants that made you feel like you weren't in a bustling city. Service was excellent and I would highly recommend this hotel. We had one little issue (not even worth mentioning) and they took our parking fee off the bill. I was so surprised out how keen they were to provide an excellent experience. Although we didn't use it there was a well equipped gym and a lovely large swimming pool area. I will book there again for sure.   The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because they don't have a restaurant on site for room service. But given what's in the neighbourhood that's not an issue.,2017-10-30T04:30:53Z,80

2783,Hotel BLU Vancouver,4.2,"We flew in from Phoenix, AZ, USA and as we were driving to the hotel we called to let them know we were coming.  The girl on the phone said that she was going to call me because the room I was guaranted that was a one level handicap room was not available and she was going to offer me a two level suite.  Well I told her that was not accessible as I rented a handicap accessible room with a balcony and that was promised over 2 months ago.  With the internet I could see how cute the chairs were, the patio, etc.  They told me there was only one room like it.  So I rented it as we were on vacation.  Well when we got to the hotel the gal said they had another handicap room.  It looked smaller, had no balcony, the mattress was so awful I could not sleep all night.  I was in pain all night.  It seemed to me as if this was a bait and switch.  They show a great room.  The price is over $350. per night but then somehow you end up with not the room you were promised.  However, they did not offer a discount for the room that we ended up with.  That was wrong.  When I brought it up at the front desk they gave me the parking off.  I felt that was very minimal.  The food for breakfast was great.  The staff were nice.  But the ability to sleep due to a bad mattress and also the lowness of the toilet were totally unacceptable to someone who is handicap.

On top of all of this, the location is the bee's knees!  Google where it's at!  I would totally reccomend this place to a friend.  And I would totally stay here again if given the opportunity.  Everyone was super friendly and helpful.  They have valet parking and are more than happy to help bring your bags up to your room.  Final verdict:  This place is the Bee's Knee's!!!",2014-12-28T15:31:10Z,80

The downside the food ; it was more on the bland side. The fish stew (2 patrons choice) had very tiny unidentifiable pieces of white fish was lukewarm and lacking flavor. The steak topping could have been on the side to be added by the diner.The duck and lentils were enjoyed by the diner. That's one out of 4. the evening was wet and cold outside the temperature in the dining room was also below comfort level.",2024-02-12T21:32:27Z,55
2793,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"A perfectly nice mid-range hotel, but I am somewhat mystified why I was paying $500/night (an unusually low rate) for what felt more like a $200/night experience (because, sir--the hotel might respond tartly--you were tired and all the other hotels in the area were full!).

This is not a Grand Hotel.  The hotel is set in an industrial area.  There are no porters; no flunkies handing out chocolates and champagne; no doorman:  you summon your own taxi.  The desk is not manned all the time.  There are no magnificent public rooms (hardly any lobby at all).  The restaurant/bar is fine but no better than several others on Granville Island (although my breakfast was tasty--if over-priced).  There is no sense of occasion.  The guests are slovenly and badly dressed (did I detect tour groups?).  My small room was overwhelmed by the bed in it.  It had a ""balcony"" but once that was equipped with two chairs and a table there was no room for me.

At 9:00 AM I received an automatic Email asking me to choose a time to check out.  The only choices it offered were ""I already have"" and ""now"" (checkout is actually at a very civilized noon).  I pointed out how strange this was to the desk.  The desk shrugged.  So do I.",2023-09-03T03:39:07Z,55

2800,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"Excellent, and a 5 star review July 6th ( but also a 1 star review on our second visit on August 1st)

July 6th. Had a great lunch in the restaurant. Excellent food, service etc. Stayed in a corner room overlooking the water. Absolutely beautiful experience. Couldn't fault it!

August 1st. Wow!! What a different reception. How could a place change so dramatically. I would say PEOPLE.....shame on you !
We were biking on a beautiful sunny day and after such a nice experience on July 6 decided to pay the patio visit. We pulled the bikes up outside by the hedge and there were many tables available with only just one customer having a meal. I asked my partner to wait at the table while I went to check with the restaurant manager that it was OK to sit at the table, incase it was reserved. As I passed into the restaurant, I was abruptly told "" you can't sit there. You have to go up front first"". I politely explained that's exactly that's what i was doing...

I spoke with the restaurant manager and she called a server over who took me back over, confirmed it was available, and said she would get some menus. 

Within a couple of minutes another server ran over while holding a water jug and said "" you can't sit there"". I explained that I had spoken to the restaurant manager and asked for some water. ""I can't serve you until you have permission to sit here"" she replied. She hovered over my partners empty water glass, hesitant to fill it, then reluctantly poured it when I asked her to pour. 

She disappeared and ANOTHER server approached us and said ""you can't sit there "". Frustrated now, I said firmly that we were  not moving and demanded some decent service, explaining the situation again. Her reply was "" that's not what they are saying happened in there"". I said ""are you calling me a lier "" and she said ""let's not go there""
!! I explained we are there, don't call me a lier and she argues that she wasn't. Anyway, my partner backed me up and we got up to leave. No one came out. They ( three girls) just stared at us from inside the restaurant. I called them out and when they finally came, I told them politely but firmly that they were the most obnoxious, rude individuals I'd ever met at a restaurant. Her reply ... ""good by ! "" 
Laugh is on the hotel and their reputation. After spending $3000 there on our first fantastic visit, guess what...no more !
We went to Bridges and had a fantastic meal and great service. We've been back to Bridges - Tap and Barrel more than 5 times this past month.  

We had planned to put our family up in the same hotel, but after our second visit which we would rate as a minus 5, decided not to give them any more money or referrals. Shame on you guys !",2022-08-22T15:58:44Z,55
2801,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"After YEARS of visiting Granville Island and hoping I could someday stay in the one and only hotel on the isle, my wish recently came true on a biz trip to Vancouver.  I was more than impressed!

The hotel is located at the end of the island, within walking distance of the main market and shops, but far enough away that it wasn't noisy.  On the water side of the hotel are sweeping views across False Creek back toward the city.  Simply breathtaking.

My room was located at the front of the hotel, overlooking the bulk of the island.  It had a huge (and super comfy) king bed and all of the usual appointments: in-room coffee, a mini bar, and toiletries.  There were plenty of great features, such as multiple places to plug in my phone and laptop chargers, a HUGE wrap-around deck (with table and chairs so I could work outside), and blackout curtains that would probably have resulted in me sleeping for three days if I hadn't set my alarm.

In the morning I ordered a pot of coffee via room service, which was just over $5 so a great deal if you know anything about room service!  We also enjoyed happy hour in their creek-side bar.  The next morning I quickly used their business center to print out my train ticket for the ride home.  And every staff member I encountered was professional, helpful, and friendly.  I would definitely stay here again!",2018-05-08T19:46:58Z,55
2802,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"We chose this hotel because of the great reviews at tripadvisor. We were quite disappointed when we first checked in into the hotel. It's actually a very small building and nothing like the pictures posted online. Housekeeping could improve cause the room wasn't very clean. Obviously, the balcony was never cleaned and quite dirty. Good thing about this hotel is the location. Walking distance to the Granville island market and wonderful views.",2022-07-09T03:45:16Z,55
2803,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"Very nice hotel in a great location.  Lots to do within walking distance.  It easy to get into the center of town but staying there makes everything else very easy to get to.  
The hotel staff is GREAT.  Our child became very ill in the middle of the night and we had to change hotel rooms.  The night manager (AJ) helped us and he was so great.  The next day we were scheduled to leave and day manager let us stay late (no charge) and was so helpful.  I'd go back in a second.",2020-05-13T18:28:36Z,55

Pros
- Rooms have a nice layout.  
- Beds are comfy.  
- Staff is very kind.
- Easy check in and check out.    
- Small workout room and sauna. 

Cons
- The wallpaper was peeling off the wall in the bathroom.
- A few dings and scratches around the walls and furniture in the room.  - Looks like some drywall was fixed, but they didn't bother to paint over it.
- Loud kids and dog running up and down the hallway.  
- Lack of privacy on the first floor near the walking trails outside.  We should have moved to a higher floor.
- Not so impressed with the Dockside Restaurant.",2018-02-18T04:37:06Z,55
2805,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"I booked a room on Hotwire for Vancouver in July which turned out to be the Granville Island Hotel.  I was able to get a good rate as I booked on Hotwire and used a Hotwire coupon.  I was quite excited because I have always wanted to stay at this hotel.

I was a bit lucky because the weekend I was looking for a hotel fell on the same weekend as the ""Celebration of Light"" and GLBT Pride.  Was a busy weekend to be sure!

I flew up from Seattle, took the light rail from the airport to Yaletown.  I walked to the Aquabus water taxi and hopped on over to Granville Island.  A bit of journey... but certainly fun and interesting!  The Aquabus was so adorable with friendly staff.

Upon arriving on Granville Island, I walked to the hotel from the docks.  It was short and easy.  As expected, the hotel is quaint and adorable positioned just off the water on the edge of the island.  The front desk was friendly and had my room ready for me.  

The room was well appointed, clean, and well decorated.  I had a view of Yaletown, the hotel's outdoor patio restaurant area, and of False Creek.  Be ready for a small bathroom and a bit of compact room.  If none of that bothers you, you'll be fine as the room has everything you need from an ironing board to a minibar!  The climate control worked well which I liked.  No strange odors in the hotel either lol... sometimes that can be an issue!

Check out time is scheduled for 11am which probably should be moved to noon.  I felt a bit rushed getting a bite to eat and packing up the morning of my departure!  Maybe you can ask for a late check out... I guessed not because the hotel was sold out from what I heard.

Upon check out I took the water taxi to the Amtrak station as I was taking a train to return to Seattle.  The water taxi got me within a few blocks from the station... piece of cake!

I didn't use the hotel's amenities...  restaurant, bar, fitness center, business center, etc. as I was mostly away from the room/hotel.  I took some time to explore Granville Island.  The market is full of fresh food and the island is dotted with restaurants, shops, etc.  

I really liked sitting on the patio of GI Gelato having coffee and a pastry.  I had been to the Sandbar Restaurant before which is a favorite!  Instead of the fitness center, I hopped on the False Creek jogging path which begins just behind the hotel.  For more recreation.... kayak, bike, and boat rentals are all found on the island!  I think I saw tennis courts, but I could be wrong.  You could spend two days exploring the island, but I was focused on Pride events which were happening on the mainland.  It was charming to see a Pride flag here and there on the island though.  I also liked how excited the front desk staff got when I mentioned I was in town for Pride.  The sincerely wished me a fun weekend!

I definitely want to stay here again.  I loved being a bit removed from the mainland but still having it at my fingertips via the water taxi.  I suggest booking a balcony room on the upper floor, which I plan to do next time!

For the water taxi, purchase a day pass if you plan on going back and forth to the mainland a few times.  It will save you money!  I was out late one evening and took a taxi back to the hotel as the water taxis generally stop service around 11pm.  The cab fare was about $10.",2016-08-04T22:11:12Z,55
2806,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,We absolutely loved our stay here! We were new to Canada and Granville Island.

2807,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"It was my birthday and my hubby took me to Canada since I have never been there before. 
-Hotel location: it's a good location because there's a public market which is a famous market, it's walking distance from the hotel. 
-service: the front desk people were very friendly and nice. They were able to provide us a lot of information about what to do in Canada. They were just so kind and always ready to help. 
-environment: it's by the harbor, we saw our first snow here. It was so beautiful. The hotel room was decent, it's clean. We had what we need as a hotel room could provide, so cannot complain more. 
-parking: it seems parking lot was so limited, we got a warning notice the next day morning. Hope they could provide more parking space and some tools for swiping the snow. 
We will still come back next time because of the good location and frie",2017-02-27T08:40:46Z,55
2808,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"We've visited Vancouver quite a few times in the past 4-5 months, each time staying at a different hotel so as to explore different areas. This past visited, we stayed at this hotel situated right on the water in Granville Island. What a lovely place!

We love Granville Island, with it's artisan studios, eclectic shops in the Loft, cute galleries, mom-and-pop boutiques, and of course the famous public market, with all its amazing produce (straight from the farm) and foodie/homemade gourmet foods, and more. So it was decided to stay in a hotel in this midst of all this awesomeness! The Granville Island Hotel did not let us down!

Super nice staff at the front desk to answer all our questions. Easy-as-pie check-in and check-out. Lovely room (we were given an available room when we arrived even though we were hours early and, technically, we were there way before check-in time). The room was spotless and we noticed the high ceilings right away, making the room feel large. Knock-out view, being on the water and all. Nice room amenities (safe in closet, all the lotions and potions and hair care items one needs in the bathroom, stocked mini-fridge, etc). Heater worked great. There was a problem with the tv but it was fixed right away (issue with the cable, apparently). Fabulous water pressure in the shower. Complimentary umbrellas (which were much needed during our trip, unfortunately) and daily newspapers, too. No surprises with charges upon check out. Bikes to rent weather permitting (nice idea! But unfortunately we couldn't take advantage of this feather as it poured the entire duration of our trip). Attached to the Dockside restaurant which is fabulous (I will review this restaurant separately). 

My only gripe is a subjective one: the beds are very firm. VERY firm. I was okay with them, but my husband was not, and our daughter also found them uncomfortable. Other than this, our stay here was great! Would definitely return to stay here again. Just lovely!",2017-03-29T07:57:44Z,55
2809,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"We visit Vancouver on a regular basis and when we do, we like to stay at the Granville Island Hotel. We mostly visit during the winter season so prices aren't as high. During our most recent stay, we were upgraded to one of their suites for no extra charge. The suite was spacious with a super nice water view. The suite was on the 1st floor and on NYE there was a party at the Dockside restaurant which the front desk warned us and advised that the party would end at 1am but when we got to the room, we didn't hear a sound at all. I would say the suite had generous amenities that you would find in any high end hotel, including an honor bar, complimentary water bottle, plus bathrobes and slippers. Hospitality is always warm when we visit as well. The hotel is also clean without any funny smells.",2017-01-02T03:37:22Z,55

2811,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"Rooms are clean if you don't have a dog room. You will know it if you do since they are ""tiled."" The bathrooms designed to accommodate dogs, smell like wet fur which is dreadful, and I have to question the overall cleanliness of these rooms. I have no problem with dogs, just not if I don't have one or if I'm paying to stay in a room without a dog smell. I also don't appreciate a maid spraying air freshener in the bathroom and denying the presence of dog, even if that's exactly why the rooms smells ""off"" in the first place. 

If you get a regular room, you are fine, but having to request that afterwards is not cool in my books. 

Most staff are quite friendly and nice. Bathrooms in lobby ok. 

Shower head amazing, but no bath in these aforementioned rooms. TVs way too huge for the room.

Skip the extremely disappointing continental breakfast.

A fine hotel for conferences, however. 

Sadly, the drive leaving GI after an event on a w/end makes this place not worthwhile in the least. Parking is at a premium, too, even for hotel guests. Not a great way to end a stay. 

View is quite pretty, but as a visitor, I would still prefer to stay somewhere comparable dt--without dog rooms. Still, the rooms are quiet overall, and the beds are comfortable, albeit, with huge neck-straining pillows.",2011-10-16T23:43:22Z,55
2812,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"The Granville Island Hotel is basically your only option if you plan to stay in Granville Island. It's a bit pricey and their gym facility is pretty terrible and difficult to find. They don't have a pool, but they do have a whirlpool and sauna to melt your tensions away. 

The rooms are pretty standard with a lovely view of the ocean from one side. They also have a brewery on site that makes delicious beer and a large restaurant, patio and bar space for conventions and guests. Their conference rooms are also very roomy with lots of light and great catering. The service I've received from staff has always been very pleasant. 

I should warn the hotel isn't quite as beautiful as the website suggests, but it's still a great place to stay.",2008-12-10T21:45:35Z,55
2813,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"Out-of-town guests may be overwhelmed by the locale, scenery etc etc. . . .  all that is Vancouver,  but that should not cloud the fact that this place is in fact horrible:  the most pretentious public place we gave ever been to.

I have never been bothered writing a review of anything, unless specifically requested to do so.  Obviously,nobody asked me to write this review.

We, my family,  live in Vancouver, very near the hotel.  So we would like to frequent its truly fabulous terrace.  However, the restaurant policy to demand unreasonable tips, arrogant waiting staff and just  average food are such that we will never go there again.  

Last time we were there, a few weeks ago, when I offered a minimal tip as an expression of my displeasure with the service, we were abused by staff and management as if tipping is an obligation rather than customer prerogative.   They even bothered to tell us to leave the place after we already had gotten up and paid out bill.   Laughable!!!!!!!!",2015-09-26T16:18:35Z,55
2814,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"I wrote a recent review of the Granville Island Hotel in my frustration with Expedia and HotelOne for not helping me with a problem there. We have had very pleasant stays at this hotel, although I hear that it is overpriced due to aging.  My real complaint is with their booking agents, but there is apparently no way to YELP against the two guilty parties... who should not be able to book here anymore. Please do not patronize either one of them.  My money and time are gone... but at least, I got to YELP.

2815,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"The Granville Island Hotel seems to emanate a calm, friendly vibe. I've never stayed here, so I can't comment much about the rooms, but I've always enjoyed coming here for events. 

It's very small, for one thing, which makes it easy to find where you're supposed to be upon arriving. The conference rooms are all on the ground floor, and they have lots of windows to let in the light and let you gaze a little on the scene outside. (Gauzy curtains provide shade, and are so much nicer than Venetian blinds - who invented those atrocities?) I never get that ""trapped in a conference room in Hotel Nowhere"" feeling. 

And I guess this will depend on your organizer/host, but they serve a strong cuppa coffee here, and pitchers of water come sensibly garnished with lemons. 

There's a decent restaurant/pub out back - a little touristy feeling with the nautical theme, but a fine place to sit back with a pint of microbrew.",2008-11-03T05:14:48Z,55

Washrooms are discrete and hang a left front the entrance, which fortunately the front desk is hidden on the right side so no one will ever see you from the lobby.

2822,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"Spent a nice evening at the GIH celebrating our anniversary - did the Aqua Bus over to Yaletown for dinner and then, as part of the package, picked up a show at the Arts Club theatre, a 5 minute walk away. This is a lovely hotel with jaw-dropping views of False Creek and the boats. The weather was sunny and warm so it couldn't have been much better. The room was small but had a cozy King bed and a nice flat screen TV so the amenities were OK. Bathroom was nice - nothing bad, nothing good. Service at the front desk was fun and courteous - they even asked whether or not we enjoyed the show. Nice touch! Andrew and Kim were really nice contact points in my calls there to firm up our stay and they were flexible and helpful with putting together a package for us. 

As part of our stay - room, theatre tickets - we also got vouchers for breakfast. The breakfast was really quite average as my partner and I both ordered omelettes (shrimp for me and one regular omelette for her). These were really quite dry and disappointing but the coffee was good the view was spectacular. 

Would we come back again? Not sure actually with so many other great spots in Vancouver but it's definitely worth the experience. Make sure you get a room with a view and do explore the dining spots in Yaletown.

I struggle to give this anymore than an average because of the cost and the meh breakfast... still, the room was nice (small though) and the front desk gang were awesome.",2010-05-09T18:18:58Z,55

2824,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"If you MUST stay on Granville  - then you really need to stay here.  Kinda average.  Rooms are cruise-ship small, bathrooms are mediocre and the hotel overall is hard to peg as any type of ""star.""  In terms of gym, I wound up forgoing the hotel gym (ahem - more like a room with a bike) and walked half a block to the Granville Island Community Centre, where I paid $5.00 and worked out in above hotel grade facilities.
Again, if you MUST stay on Granville Island then your options are limited.
Drink alot in the bar - pass out with your feet hanging over the bed, wake up at 530 and go the the Community Centre to work out.",2009-04-30T01:11:11Z,55
2825,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,I'm writing this from my too hard mattress at the Granville. We came to stay here after three nights at the Magnolia Hotel in Victoria - what a huge difference. At this price point Granville is providing low quality of service. There is no greeter at the entry or anyone to offer help with luggage. There were also flies swarming in the entry and lobby. Front desk check-in was poor with attendant staring into computer screen. No introduction to hotel or explanation of amenities or concierge. Also a woman at the desk proposed an offer of an upgrade to an executive suite with king bed and queen sofa since they were short on double queen rooms but it would be $50 more instead of regular $80 - really? I'm helping you but I still have to pay? We said no to that offer and then she said that's ok I have 6 more people I can ask. How rude. She walked away and that was our introduction to what Granville had to offer. Room is small and glasses needed to be cleaned before using - one had something dark stuck on the rim. We requested more towels and the gentleman who brought them was helpful and cheerful - the only person we encountered all day who acted like he cared. The mattresses are hard and you'll only get two pillows. Food and service at restaurant were good though there are many options nearby. Hotel location is great but everything else big disappointment.,2018-07-20T05:22:41Z,55
2826,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"They have free wifi and walking distance to the Market.  The self parking is $15/day.  
They have an iHome and bring your HDMI connectors for your media player.  I am happy that they didn't disable the connector.  I really don't have any complaints.  It is a good value overall.  One of my minor gripes was that the hotel was under some remodeling.  Gym was not in service and they gave this an older smaller room with popcorn ceiling.  I complained and they gave me an upgraded one with a balcony.  Check out my photo!  Also, they have a restaurant that didn't match the value of the room.  If I could theoretically afford to eat at the hotel's restaurant often, I would have stayed at a higher-end hotel in downtown Vancouver.  In my case, I ate at the Market (which is perfectly fine) and just had drinks in their patio.  Oh and the patio does not close late because noise restrictions.  I suppose that is a Canada thing.

Oh and check out my minibar photos.",2013-06-03T07:09:55Z,55
2827,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"What a great experience.  We stayed only a few nights but would love to go back.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  The restaurant is wonderful.  The food is well above average and the view of the marina and the city across the water is amazing and peaceful.  I highly recommend their breakfast.  
The Hotel itself is hidden on a great artisan community island but only minutes from downtown by car or water taxi.  It is right there with some wonderful shops and the Market just across the island.  
Well worth the stay!",2013-08-10T13:08:22Z,55
2828,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"On our mother-daughter trip when I was moving back to Vancouver, we were lucky enough to get to stay at the Granville Island Hotel. What a pleasant time, and stunning location right by marinas with some rooms even overlooking the water! From the friendly front desk man, to the cleanliness of the room, and not to mention  the free hotel bars of soap and bottles of lotion that I collect, everything factored into a superbly enjoyable stay. I really like, especially in hotels, when the front desk people are legitimately friendly, and not super fake and over-the-top formal.

The room was set up with two queen-sized beds, a sleek TV, mini fridge, big window, dresser drawers, and a pristine bathroom with a rainshower!

They offer parking spots to guests, and the hotel is in close on-foot proximity to the market and several bars and a handful of performance venues. 

Whether you are a tourist, local Vancouverite needing a place to stay until you move, or looking for accommodation for your family visiting town, definitely check out GIH.",2012-10-07T20:51:04Z,55

2830,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"My family has traveled to Granville Island and stayed at the Granville Island Hotel for as long as I can remember, probably over 10 years now, for Thanksgiving. The hotel recently went through some remodels and the new side of the hotel is really nice. The service has always been excellent, clean rooms, great views of the water, the location is superb as it is in walking distance to great restaurants and the market, and the dining room is excellent. The only downside is over the last couple years we have noticed that elements we enjoy about our stay at the hotel have not been offered. This year they had closed the restaurant for a private event and our family was pushed into a corner with no view for breakfast. It is understandable to hold events, but when the room prices stay pricey and you're not getting the full use what the hotel says they offer, it is very disappointing.",2015-12-01T20:26:55Z,55

The girl who checked us in was amazing...she had long dark hair....I'm sorry I did not get her name!  We had a romantic dinner at the Dockside restaurant and it was fabulous! Great table right by the window, scrumptious food and wine. The weekend could not have gone better. All the sunshine was pretty awesome too! I would highly recommend this hotel and restaurant!

2835,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,Our friends Sheri & Michael chose the Granville Island Hotel for the location of their wedding ceremony and reception.  We enjoyed staying at the hotel (the rooms and bathrooms are gorgeous) and attending the special event.  The hotel is a great venue for weddings.  And being so close to the public market was a perk as well.,2010-11-04T00:34:15Z,55

2837,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"Comfortable, clean, spacious hotel in a great location.  Plenty of reserved hotel parking in the lot right next to the hotel (they charge a daily rate to your room).  Easy walking to all parts of Granville Island.  Great view of downtown.

The room:  we had a standard room on the 2nd floor.  Updated interior.  Comfortable king-sized bed.  Approx. 42"" flat panel TV on a dresser right in front of the bed with a decent enough channel selection.  It bugged me though that the inaccessible channels were not hidden from view, so when you flip through the stations you keep coming across stations that aren't part of the hotel's channel lineup.  Also many channels are just the standard definition version of its HD version (??).  Basically the TV stations that are accessible to hotel visitors could use a lot of cleanup to make channel browsing less of an annoyance.  Standard desk and desk chair.  Additional sitting chair near the window.  Refrigerated mini-bar with selection of those tiny liquor bottles, soft drinks, water, wine and beer, chips, candy and other snacks.  The mini-bar is small and crammed full of stuff but with some rearranging you should be able to fit some small personal items in it that need refrigeration (like we did).  Our view was of the restaurant/lounge's outdoor seating area (that was empty and not used this time of year), and beyond we could see a couple moored boats, False Creek and the highrises of Yaletown...was a great view.  Two of our windows opened (no screens) and we had them open quite a bit while we were in our room.  The room does have an A/C but we found it didn't keep the room as cool as we would have liked...so having the windows open helped.  There is a small safe in the closet.  It was very quiet both during the day and at night, with occasional noise coming from (I think) seaplanes or boats.  Included are both wi-fi for wireless Internet and an ethernet cable for wired connections.

Bathroom:  decent size.  Modern toilet that flushes well.  Glass-enclosed large shower-only stall with both a large regular shower head and a separate handheld low-pressure shower wand.  Towels are nice and comfortable enough.  Typical selection of soap, shampoo, conditioner and other items are included.

Staff:  all of the various front desk staff we encountered (I think three different people) were friendly and nice.

One afternoon we ate at the Dockside restaurant inside the hotel.  We ate from the still-extensive lounge menu as it was in-between lunch and dinner.  The food and beer (beer made on-site) were tasty and the view of False Creek, Yaletown and beyond could not be beat.  Room service from Dockside is available to the hotel rooms.

I would recommend staying at this hotel.  The market, shops and restaurants on the island will keep you busy, and all are within walking distance of the hotel.  And being near downtown the rest of Vancouver is within easy reach.",2013-03-29T22:29:59Z,55

2840,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"I have to be honest; I'm disappointed. Our experience just wasn't very good.

We'd called to ask if we could check in early, and the guy who answered checked, said ""sure, we have your room ready"", and told us to come on in. He didn't say anything about it being dependent on other check-ins or anything; we understood that OUR room was ready. So, we drove a half hour, lugged our stuff in, and went to check in. The guy we spoke to on the phone - Jason - was also the guy who checked us in, and right away, he just couldn't have seemed less interested that we were customers. It was busy, so perhaps he was stressed/frazzled, but we got an indifferent vibe from him. We said who we were, and he pulled up our reservation, studied the computer for a few minutes, then said ""we've had a lot of early check-ins, so the ready rooms went to them. You can wait until two, if you like, then try again?"" It was 12:15 at this point, and we had other plans/things to do - we were only in Vancouver for 40 hours or so. He then said ""I do realize you called ahead, but we weren't anticipating so many early arrivals."" 

I said ""We've just driven a half hour; it would have been great if you'd mentioned on the phone that our check-in wasn't guaranteed. We were told our room was ready.""

And he replied ""As I've just *explained*, there was no way for us to expect so many early check-ins, and the rooms went to them.""

No ""sorry,"" no ""let me see what I can do,"", no ""sorry for the delay/inconvenience"", no ""shoot, sorry to hear you drove a while to reach us"" - nothing. 

So, rather than driving all the way back, we brought both of our bags, and our cooler, into the lobby and sat and waited. And then he called housekeeping and checked on the room, and then our room was ready in 15 minutes. I guess they didn't like us sitting there. 

The room was small. Very. very. small. Granted, it had a king-sized bed in it, but the addition of a chair squeezed next to the bed on one side meant we had a choice of operating the window curtains OR pulling the bedclothes up and down as needed, not both. The window didn't quite close properly (nor quite open properly), and so much moisture had leaked in that the wallpaper around the window was mildewed/moldy and warped. Our view consisted of a slanted roof, a bunch of suites we could see into (and vice versa, I'm sure), with a wedge of ocean/sky visible between them, which was pretty.

There was no breakfast included, though we did have a room service menu provided with standard breakfast fare like $14.00 omelettes. 

The shower took ages to warm up, and once in the shower, the pipes made enormously loud rumbling, groaning and roaring noises, during which times the water would stutter and stop for a moment.

The parking was $12.00. I know it's common, but I really feel like...if someone is paying to stay at your hotel, just let them park their car. Really. It just seems so tacky.

That said, here are the good bits:

-the king-sized bed was very clean and very comfortable. We slept well.

-It was quiet

-the back of the hotel has a lovely view

-the tv in the room was big (though actually too large for a room so small)

-the shower in the bathroom, despite the warming-up and pipes issues, was very cool - clear glass door, with a handheld/mounted head option or an overhead waterfall option, which was lovely.

-the toilet has a watersave flush option (half flush), which I like to see.

-...the ice machine worked fine...

seriously, the price isn't bad, considering it's such a touristy area, but from the get-go we were a little soured with our reception, which was somewhere between rude and indifferent, and just really not what we were hoping for on our mini-vacation. We had a good sleep, but given the overall experience, and how little they seem interested in their customers' happiness, I wouldn't recommend staying here, and I myself can't see going back.",2010-02-01T06:31:11Z,55

2843,Granville Island Hotel,3.6,"We stayed here Spring 2017.  Loved the location and options on the island. Beware that the pictures of water view rooms DO NOT represent all the water view rooms but instead rooms that have been remodeled and have the best water views and large bathrooms; some are a sideways view, and some are on the 1st floor bordering the sidewalk with pedestrians able to see very easily into the room. Also, the noise from private events is quite loud. When I complained they kept promising it would end at a certain point and then it would continue on.  The first floor suite we had was an awkward set-up with no night stand for one side of the bed, but instead had a large wardrobe next to it. The bathroom was quite small and old for the cost of the room. We also had loud people above us (where they went when the wedding ended) and were loud even when asked by the hotel staff to keep it down. This hotel runs private events in the restaurant and these go late and then the party can continue in rooms.  Consider yourself warned.",2017-11-04T01:09:39Z,55

After hours of hanging out on the patio inspite of arriving at 6 pm there was no tables available for dinner, no blankets even though it was offered to several other guests..we never got our water glasses refilled even though we asked.  The meal arrived in drips and drabes...had to ask several time for cutlery.   Finally at the end of the evening after waiting 45 min for coffee we got 1 and 1/2 cups because they ""ran out"".

The room was kind of small, but the worst part it was dirty!  Hair on the blanket, sink dirty, some brown stuff on top of the blanket.  Floor was sticky.  We were shocked, we didn't think the room got cleaned at all.  We were glad we were so close to Canada Place, 2.1 miles.  It was $12 by Uber or Lyft or Taxi.  They were kind enough to hold our luggage while we checked out and went to the Suspension Bridge.  We came back to pick the luggage up and left to catch the cruise ship.  The people/workers were very kind, and went way out of their way.  One gentleman pushed our luggage to the cab a kind of far distance.

If you are a tourist and have high hotel standards this place is not for you!  It's a good trek from most desirable tourist attractions and located in a less desirable neighborhood.  

I read all of the previous posts AFTER I booked and it was too late to cancel/change my reservations without monetary penalties...so we stuck it out and stayed. 

All of the unsavory details were true:  sketchy neighborhood, old, out dated furnishings, unpleasant odors and loud club music late into the night.  You get what you paid for!  We should have sprung for a better hotel.  Every local we talked to sarcastically asked, ""why the heck did you chose to stay here?"" Hahaha!!

IF YOU ARE A YOUNG PARTY-GOER ON A BUDGET....THIS HOTEL IS A JEWEL!!!!!

-reasonably priced
-liquor store adjacent to lobby entrance 
-restaurant on site
-Tiki Bar and club are located just downstairs 
-being loud is not a problem 

Drink, party and stumble back to your room without worrying about transportation or breaking the bank.  The Tiki Bar has very cool themed parties that attracts hundreds of patrons on weekend nights.  Check the schedule before you come so you can be appropriately dressed for the party theme.

2850,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"This place is awful.  I was here on a family vacation, 2 rooms booked for 2 nights.  We couldn't even stay another night and we ended up booking rooms at the Metropolitan.  

Right when we walked into our room the smell hits your face like a ton of bricks.  It smells like a struggling alcoholic lived here for years, years of built up spilled liquor soaked into the carpet.  That and BO.  Then that person recovered, moved out and the hotel just tidied up.  Not even some Febreez.  I can't get over the smell.

The lobby looks nice when you walk in but when you walk upstairs to you're room, well that's a different story.  Everything is so outdated.  But other than the smell and looks of the place, good luck trying to sleep.  The attached Tiki Room is more than just loud-- the rooms SHAKE with the bass.  The DJ wasn't bad at all, it's just that when you come to a hotel you expect that you'll be able to sleep.  

I would not recommend this place to anyone.",2019-05-17T16:22:11Z,66

Not only was the room filthy when we arrived, but the ""tiki bar"" downstairs turned out to be a dance club playing the loudest bass I've ever heard in my life. Our room was actually shaking! It would be impossible to sleep here. They need massive disclaimers before accepting bookings through any and all platforms as well as signs in the lobby to warn you of what's to come so you don't wind up coming back to a nasty surprise after your evening plans, leaving you to make a late night change. The Atrium down the street was luckily able to accommodate us and was lovely.",2019-05-29T01:54:04Z,66
2853,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"Even though the bar is located on East Hastings and close to Commercial Drive, this is the kind of place you picture yourself going to in the suburbs. It's a large amazing space, with a huge stage, pool table and even a cigarette machine at the back. The walls are covered with posters of rock/movie stars, and the dim lighting is aided by a few neon lit beer advertisements. 

Somehow host to an eclectic mix of cover bands, hip hop artists, reggae DUB DJs and punk rockers, the Waldorf still doesn't get a lot of respect, and is not the preferred drinking establishment of record producers. It's classic though, and great for bands and their friends to take over and let loose. 

The huge picture of the palm tree attached to the front of the building is a reference to the tiki room, a smaller space located to the left after entering the front doors. It's more for birthday parties, but there is a bar and a relaxed Caribbean theme. Perfect for bands with smaller entourages.",2008-11-29T02:29:01Z,66
2854,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"I was recently lucky enough to attend an event held in the fabulous Tiki Room in the Waldorf Hotel. This has got to be the best room in the city to throw a swank party. They've got a restored ceiling painted blue and studded with twinkly lights, vintage Hawaiian paintings, giant fake palm trees, and the piece de resistance, the coolest semicircular tiki bar. Behind the stage (or DJ booth if that's how it's set up) there's a fake waterfall mirage.

The bathroom doors are hidden in the walls, and are not so swank, but they do the job. 

The only thing that could make this place better was if they carried the retro/Hawaii theme right into the drinks with some paper umbrellas or some fruit on those little plastic swords of yore. I'm picturing maraschino cherries, cubes of pineapple... Better yet, a pretty coconut for a glass. And crazy straws! C'mon, presentation! 

They did make a decent mai tai, and then an eyecatching Blue Hawaiian. Unfortunately, they seemed to forget the alcohol. If I, a pretty cheap date, can still feel sober after four drinks, then the barkeep needs to tip the bottle a couple seconds longer.",2008-11-10T04:30:40Z,66

The moment you walk in the room you could smell the mold and the restroom was even worse. The room service maids re-used dirty sheet and would just flip them around. After walking around and showering barefoot i developed a rash on my feet. The place overall was very unsanitary. I do not recommend anyone ever staying here! Ever!,2018-11-29T09:09:08Z,66

Najib's Special (Nuba's signature cauliflower dish) is a favourite (surprise, surprise) but if you like Lebanese food, their other items will treat you well. I warn you though, their cocktails are MIGHTY strong. If you're a fan of girly drinks, these may be too intense for you, but you can appreciate that the staff are generous with their liquor at least!

If you're lucky, you'll see an all ages crowd at around 9pm. It's a real highlight to see older couples taking the dance floor to bust a move to old classics. Totally rad. I love seeing older folks having a good time",2010-12-28T10:10:23Z,66
2857,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"Mixing the old and new, this place has a certain unique atmosphere that I really like. 

We came here for their Halloween Party, the line ups were long, but we braved the rain, and finally got in. 

Enter the place. To the left, a funky Tiki room, with a royal blue light tint, with faux palm trees throughout. It's one cool space. 

We also got to tour some of the hotel's 30 newly renovated rooms, each with a different scene, and a 'live' show was going on in each one. They all had a 'tiki' theme in the rooms. I was impressed by some of them, with flat screen tvs, clean white duvets, and the washrooms- a bit of the classic, vintage decor. 

There's also a larger cafe/ lounge on the main floor (run by Nuba's Ernesto Gomez and chef Ned Bell of Le Crocodile & Lumiere), and a small hair salon (run by Barbarella Hair). 

Downstairs is where all the action happens. 2 rooms, one with a large circular dance floor and tables and seats around, and the other-a long room, with a rectangular dance floor. In between the 2 spaces-one large bar, all decorated with the Tiki theme. There are only 2 bathrooms on this floor, teeny tiny sized though. 

Very cool makeover indeed. Great to see old spaces mixing with new design to create a one of a kind space. Can't wait to try out the restaurant here!!",2010-11-02T05:47:55Z,66

Definitely can't walk a block past the hotel without entering sketchy area. The hotel parking lot is a frequent hang out for men who work next door and it was nerve racking for two young women to walk out to our car even in the day light. The room was about as nice as you would expect for the price. Dust around all corners of the room, no shower curtain, mold in the shower, something nasty on the bathroom wall, dirty fridge, etc. Wouldn't go back- not worth being frugal.",2019-06-22T20:07:09Z,66
2859,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"You get what you pay for,sure it's old,kinda shoddy, near the worst part of town but the front desk is very helpful, there is a market and Starbucks across the street. For only $48 USD it's as cheap as a hostel and lots of character. Not the place to bring a lover but fine for a one night stand date. Close to public transportation, train station,ferry,cruise ports,and hip areas.Can be noisy as there is a band most weekends,but the hotel offers ear plugs lol.

2860,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"This review is for the hotel, because guess what, this is a hotel! But I guess everyone wants to go to the party and not actually spend the night. 

Anyhow, I chose to book a night here after reading about it in a Bon Appetit article (http://www.bonappetit.com/magazine/2011/09/art-the-coast-with-the-most).  I'm not sure if any of the hipsters who frequent the Waldorf for their nightlife ever read Bon Appetit, but there might be a foodie or two in the mix, as the hotel restaurant was quite busy. 

So, this place is like one-stop shopping for the party enthusiast. (Maybe it's a Walmart spinoff. Get it? Wal-dorf. Wal-mart. Eh? Eh? Never mind.) 
There are 2 restaurants and a Tiki-themed bar, as well as a music space downstairs. The hotel rooms are clean and simple, with a fun retro vibe. Bathrooms are tiled pink and go with that retro vibe. Bed was comfy, I was in a standard queen at the end of the hall. You can hear the crowds outside and a bit of the music, but it was not overly loud. Unfortunately, I was awakened at 5 in the morning to the incredibly loud garbage truck. That was far worse than the music and crowds. Plus my room was missing the bottled water and the mixed tape, plus the old stereo was not working, and I was told it was not just for show. The girl up front was sweet but not very helpful at all. 

If you're coming in sort of late, this hotel is a good spot, since you can check in, grab a drink and not worry about getting around anywhere. The area itself seems a bit sketchy at night, but the parking lot is well lit. The price is affordable, would not recommend at all for families, but instead for a group of friends or the solo traveler.",2011-09-28T15:42:00Z,66
2861,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"I always like to start with the Tiki Bar. It's almost too hip and trendy for its own good. It's such a cool place to sit back and enjoy a cocktail.

I had to grab another fresh coconut and rum drink. It's a struggle to describe how tasty the coconut milk is with your choice of rum or tequila.

I had a blast hopping from room to room, mingling about and soaking in the retro classic yet timeless vibe of the hotel.

The sangrias were dynamite. I absolutely adore the Waldorf Hotel and its new incarnation. It's definitely worth the trek out deep into East Van on Hastings Street.

Because of the cool vibe, offbeat locale, and blast from the past feel, the Waldorf attracts a special kind of hipster. These ones are particularly trendy and beyond irony. The Leeteg Room is a great spacious lounge-type dining room providing an excellent atmosphere.

The food was so delicious. The Spanish eats were delightful and tasty with a special portion of sauces and cheeses. The Waldorf is a great, cultural and entertainment hub in strong contrast to the hub downtown. The great food only add to its appeal and unique cultural atmosphere.",2011-03-31T04:56:18Z,66
2862,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"We stayed here for a couple of days before getting on a cruise to Alaska. This place was nothing special really. If you are looking to travel on a budget (as we were) this place is affordable. The pictures of rooms on here do not reflect the room we stayed in. Our room was tiny, but clean, and served its purpose. My only complaint was that on the last day we took the sheets off the bed before leaving and the mattress was pretty stained. Gross. Also, they don't have electric locks on the doors yet, so make sure you lock your room going in and out. The hallway lighting and carpeting could really use redoing too.. 

The front desk staff and nice and helpful. The location is within walking distance to multiple breweries, which is why I think my husband decided to book our room here. 

Don't waste your time at the restaurant. Though the service was good, the pizza we ordered was nothing more than bread and sauce with a few pieces of mozzarella that was barely cooked. It wasn't worth what we paid for it. We basically paid for convenience that night.",2015-08-12T13:38:38Z,66
2863,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"I hadn't been to the Waldorf for quite a while (years) and my lady wanted to go check out a 90s trivia night they were hosting in their bar. 

I could go on at length about this evening, but instead I'll keep it short. WORST experience I have had in a long time. 

Our food never actually arrived, in despite us being some of the earliest patrons and ordering first (we were starving) only to eventually watch practically the entire rest of the place get their food served to them. When we questioned the waitress on staff she actually had the audacity to say to us ""Well, who orders food at a bar anyway?"".. 

Yes, this was her stance. 

I won't ever come back here. Gave it a shot, this was our experience. We walked out of there hungry and upset and needing to go eat somewhere else. 

Oh, and the trivia night was absolutely pathetic. No organization, and was really lame.

2864,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,A charming boutique hotel. Excellent location right next to major transit bus route.  Across from a grocery store and a Starbucks. Has a very good restaurant attached. The only con is the area is transitionary on the way to becoming gentrified. But not yet done.

2865,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"[Insert swirling time travel music] and then a piece from the Rocky Horror Picture Show....

The new space is astounding, 
Like when you jump to the left (and there's a tiki bar in full swing)
Or then take a step to the right (and a cafe with kick ass food is being served)
You march your knees downstairs (and there's a cabaret)
But it's the DJ lounge, with another bar that really drives you insane,
Yeah, Let's do the Time Warp again!

""It's so dreamy, oh fantasy free me
So you can't see me, no not at all (Halloween Party after all)
In another dimension, with voyeuristic intention
Well-secluded, I see all
With a bit of a mind flip
You're there in the time slip
And nothing can ever be the same
You're spaced out on sensation, like you're under sedation
Let's do the Time Warp again!""

Welcome back Waldorf!! You're my new favourite multi-space: a hair salon (Barbarella), 3 bars, 2 restaurants - serving Spanish inspired eats, a cabaret space with live music, and of course the tiki bar. The time and care that the new staff at Waldorf took to restoring the space has left me awestruck. The speakers cranking tunes are revamped originals; the bamboo and artwork are throwbacks from generations past, even the images projected in the DJ lounge (is there a real name for space?) reflect the Waldorf's affection and attention for the history of it all. 

Sitting in the cafe, listening to tunes from the 60s, at last night's Halloween grand opening I wondered if my grandparents sipped on Pina Coladas or just a scotch on the rocks from the tiki bar back in the day.",2010-10-31T17:39:40Z,66

I was introduced to the Waldorf years ago.  Driving by you may think.. meh.. another sorta out dated run down hotel, with an unassuming sign and a say nothing bar in the lobby.  However the real gem is located in the basement.  A PERFECTLY IN TACK TEAKY LOUNGE!! (see picture above)..I know!  Complete with black velvet paintings, a bamboo bar, and mood lighting as far as the eye can see!

2867,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"For a place where my mom used to hang out when she was young, the Waldorf is pretty darn rad. I hadn't been to the Waldorf in a few years, so when I visited on Saturday I was thrilled about just how, well, ""cool"" it had become. On Fridays and Saturdays the cover is $10, but it gains you entrance into not one but THREE (or more) events going on in the hotel. There's something totally different going on in every room, so if you're coming with friends there's bound to be something they'll all enjoy.

I would go so far as to say the Waldorf is THE best venue in the city. Some reasons this is true:

-the bouncers aren't douchebags, and they don't make you wait when there's room available inside
-there's always something interesting going on. My friend summed it up best when she said ""Where do they get all their ideas from?"" Sad clowns handing out sour kids = awesome (true story)
-the drinks in the tiki bar, though pricey, are STRONG. Prepare to be knocked on your ass after a couple.
-FREE 80's night on Thursdays
-hilarious staff. Where else can you go where staff members will give patrons a hug?
-it's walking distance from my house. For those who need to commute, there are bus stops right outside the door
-it has an awesome retro-Vegas vibe
-the patrons are generally pretty rad. Is it weird to want to be friends with the strangers dancing beside you?
-the name ""Waldorf"" makes me think of Wharf from Star Trek - The Next Generation (I just outed myself as a nerd, didn't I?)

If you want to go somewhere totally unique, with random and hilarious events going on, hit up the Waldorf. Oh yeah, you can even have your hangover brunch here the next day too.",2011-08-10T00:39:30Z,66
2868,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"We visited the Waldorf the night before their official Halloween Grand Opening to check out the Black Wizard show (note: best band in Vancouver right now!) and I had a rip-roaring good time. 

Things I loved: 

* Huge space with lots of different areas to hang in like the band room and the other down stairs room opposite the coat-check with the dance floor, the upstairs bar/tiki lounge....lots of places to go on little missions to! 

* Outside smoking area! I don't smoke but I do like to hang around outside bars and shoot the shit without leaving the premises. 

* Happy, friendly staff! 

* Free Food! They brought out a crazy amount of free Mexican-inspired nibbles so that we could try the menu. Free snacks! I heart you Waldorf!! 

I also visited The Waldorf this weekend for brunch with a girlfriend and to check out their vintage clothing sale, The Chosen Ones. Great selection of clothing from about 10 vendors, good prices and well displayed. They are having this monthly so check it out! 

Brunch was nice. Mimosas and espresso were both a thumbs up. I had ""The Waldorf"", which was poached eggs, fresh avocado/tomato, and a potato galette with crispy proscuitto/ham. All was delicious, except the galette was kind of grey and a weird texture and flavor (it was kind of like sticky rice or something and tasted strange) but we got some fries with homemade aioli instead and our belly's were happy. It was only their second brunch since opening, so I can't be too hard on these guys! 

Overall - YES. Go there. Check it out. Give them some love.",2010-11-16T00:01:58Z,66
2869,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"This review is for the hotel only:

First, I want to commend the staff for being so accommodating, kind and quick to apologize for our horrible experience. Second, I want to take responsibility for my part in having such a horrible stay: I am not from Vancouver, and I did not know that the hotel and night club were literally on top of one another.

That said, I would have liked to know that I'd be trying to sleep in a room that shook with bass until the early morning, and that I'd be sharing a floor with rowdy, screaming neighbors who were probably just taking advantage of discounted rates after 12am. I mean, if I were partying in East Van and needed a super inexpensive place after the bars closed to sleep off the impending hangover, I would totally choose the Waldorf.

I really wanted to love this place. I imagined it would be similar to the cheap & chic boutique hotels of Portland and Seattle, and at first it certainly appeared to be turning out that way. 

Pros: simple but tasteful decor, great (Co. Bigelow!) toiletries, nice view of the mountains, welcoming lobby, a vintage clothing sale in the hallway, fantastically-reviewed food waiting the next morning at Mexican brunch. 

Cons: There's a night club underneath you. It was like trying to fall asleep in a speaker cabinet. The walls rattled. The bass was inescapable, and when the club finally closed after 2am, the neighbors took over. By 5am we were sore from tossing and turning and ready to check out.

When we let the front desk know (did I mention how nice they were?) that we would be checking out instead of staying another night as planned, they offered us a ""quieter"" room, but when pressed admitted that it wouldn't be ""completely quiet."" This may be my mistake, thinking I could stay at a hotel with a nightlife and not be disturbed (although I have to admit that Portland's Ace served as my example here - Clyde Commons stays awake pretty late and I've never noticed. And I've logged about a month solid in that hotel on business trips).

The staff graciously discounted our room, apologized profusely, and steered us in the direction of good coffee.

Moral of the story: don't stay at the Waldorf if you need to get some sleep, unless you plan on staying up until 2 drinking with the rest of the patrons.",2011-02-20T01:35:42Z,66
2870,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"The other night my friends held a catered event at the Waldorf. From the moment they were booking the event, to the time we all arrived, ate, danced, drank and celebrated the staff, food, venue were amazing. First the venue is fantastic, wonderfully preserved 60's Vegas kitsch. They provided amazing support for the musicians who were coming to play, and the A/V support went above and beyond the call of duty. One staff member even drove home to get the part we needed to get it all going.

 The Food was fabulous, if you do not know Nuba does the catering at the Waldorf and the food they provided was as spectacular as their resto in gastown.   You know the food was great because almost 150 people from all ages dove on it and talked about it all night.

 You can say that many places offer good food and a room for the event, but the Staff at the Waldorf is it's real standout. They worked hard to make sure the event was  a success, they were friendly, and helpful all night. 

 If you are looking to host any event or party, give this gem a serious look. They will treat you great and will I am sure make it an event that people will talk about for a long time.",2011-03-05T21:51:50Z,66
2871,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"Kuddo's to the Waldorf for revamping itself from a ghetto crack-house into a pretty swanky hipster haven. The restaurant (Nuba) feels like a natural fit for the place, and turns out some pretty good food. 

That being said, the people running Friday nights here need a lesson in hospitality. Was here for a large party (30+ people) that included dinner at Nuba, and after party in the downstairs bar. That was the plan anyways....

I have NEVER been to an establishment that expects you to re-exit the establishment after dinner to pay for cover to get into the bar. That's right, after spending in the region of $2000-2500 on dinner/drinks all of us were told to go back outside, line up in the guest list line, and pay a $15 cover to get into the bar downstairs. 

Nevermind the fact that when the reservations were originally made, we were told that if you had dinner at Nuba the bar cover would be comped. Now that makes perfectly good sense, and has been my experience at every other hotel restaurant/bar I've ever been to IN THE WORLD. 

Seriously, Waldorf...don't you think you're taking this whole ""non-conformist"" thing a bit to far?",2012-07-23T19:01:16Z,66
2872,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"On my first visit here, I was definitely impressed. 
Had a great time dancing, affordable drinks and rooms for everyone's liking. 

The only advice I have  - keep an eye on your stuff. And I know it applies to any place, but I was quite shocked when a security guard passed by our table (we were dancing 2 feet away and it was my mistake - I forgot my cell on the table), took my phone, TURNED IT OFF (he wouldn't want anyone to be able to retrieve it obviously) and slipped in his pocket. Thankfully, my friend noticed and we quickly approached this security guard and asked for the phone back. He actually hesitated! 

I 100% understand that I shouldn't have left the phone - but things happen, you forget. I just did not expect such a blatant act of theft.",2012-08-27T19:28:26Z,66
2873,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"Man, this place definitely deserves more than five stars.

Just to be up front, I popped two hits of mdma right before I left the house.

It was a Monday night and I wanted to get my party on so a friend referred me to the Waldorf for something called Icecream Social. The vibe there was super different. I've been to many dj nights in my time - trust me - from Andy Tokyo to Erlend Oye. What's new about this place is these guys spin vinyl but play the music that my parents listened to. I can just imagine people thrifting for the newest retro find to play at this night. They dug up some amazing oldies but goodies, that one Rolling Stone song is awesome.

The dancefloor was jam packed with pretty girls, a couple not as pretty ones, but their dancing really sparked up their appeal too. Everyone was dancing and looked just as happy as I felt, was everyone else here high too? I'm not sure if there's a dress code but some of the bartenders were wearing those old-fashioned caps which I felt added to the whole retro ambience.

As far as the drinks go, I got two delicious whiskey colas but I set both them down at different times and couldn't find them when I went back for them later. Fair enough. My one complaint was that the bar had a really long line so it took a while of waiting to get my glass of water refilled. That and some dude was kind of a dick when he walked into me getting loose and spilled some of his coconut thing. Everything else was definitely amazing though.

I felt like I had been time-warped back to the 60s. Especially because my wind phone didn't have service in there. I guess the tiki's threw off the signal, haha!

I will definitely be coming back here on mdma not that I'm easing into this whole swing thing!",2012-05-16T06:21:40Z,66

2875,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"What's not to love about The Waldorf? My girlfriend is so into this place - she will take any excuse she can find to go for a drink after work (it's the closest restaurant/bar).

Service is impeccable. I haven't been there when it's been busy but I've always found the servers to be friendly, attentive, and interested in what I have to say. Maybe because I am fascinating, but maybe because they are good at their jobs.
The drink list is so appealing that I have a hard time figuring out what to get. They offer delicious wines for a reasonable by-the-glass price (try the Santa Ana white) and their cocktails are fresh and tropical, going along with the tiki theme.
I haven't really eaten there yet - I had a salad (marinated oyster mushrooms) that was actually incredible, but that's it. Really, though, I never order salads (I'm vegan - but that doesn't mean I subsist on greens and vinegar) but that salad was something. It was a lot of food for the price ($8) and the oyster mushrooms were tender and perfectly marinated.

There's now a Cafe Nuba in the tiki lounge next to the restaurant, on the main floor. It's hard to go wrong with Nuba; anyone who hasn't eaten there is seriously missing out.

The decor in the restaurant is great. Pastel chairs, bamboo walls, low but not inadequate lighting. It's a fantastic place for a date or a business meeting - and I've never felt rushed or disapproved of for getting a little wine drunk rowdy with my friends.

2877,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"I find the Waldorf hot and cold. It's best avoided during their big multi-room parties, like Hallowe'en and New Years, which tend to have overpriced cover, and get so crowded that it takes 10 minutes to move to the next room. The food is only so-so, and the staff are inconsistent - some are cool, some are clueless, and some (especially during those multi-room parties) are horribly rude. I bought a four-day pass to their Hallowe'en ""weekend"" last year, and the first night I went, the staff at the door snapped ""NO IN-OUTS ALLOWED"" when I dared to open the front door for a second. Um, yeah, it's a four-day pass, so unless you're giving me a free hotel room for the weekend, I'm gonna come and go as I please.

On the other hand, the Waldorf is wonderfully supportive of the arts in Vancouver, which is something of a rarity in this culture-phobic city. They host some pretty good dance parties in their downstairs rooms, they screen art house movies occasionally, and one of their hotel rooms has been converted into a cool art gallery space. When the Waldorf is great, it's really great. I just wish it were more consistent.",2012-04-16T16:58:31Z,66

2880,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"Nighttime review:

SENSORY OVERLOADDD!!!  

Disco balls.
Loud music.
Unexplainable decorations.
Carpeted floors.
Sinky chairs.

Well sir, you had me at DISCO BALLS.  

ROOMS
The Waldorf has rooms.  No, I'm not talking about the hotel rooms, but rooms with different themed music; intimate rooms.  Since it's set in a hotel, I felt like I was at a conference (or someone's house) so it's eclectically homey.  Definitely unlike other clubs/venues in Vancouver.

SOUND
I came on a Saturday night for some live band action.  As a live band venue, it's great for indie.  Space is small.  Sound a tad too loud but less muffled than other places I've been to - I can actually hear the lyrics!  

CROWD
It's not super crowded.  It's one of those places people go to if there's a special event or it's 12:05am and you happen to find yourself strolling the streets of Hastings and think to yourself ""wow, i need to dance asap"".  As the night wears on, the place quickly gets emptier and emptier...to a point where you could hug every person in the room in 3 minutes or less.  Or lightly high five them.  This could also be because the Waldorf is not easily transitable and the carriage turns into a pumpkin after midnight.  

DRINK
It appears most people mingle around the carpeted bar area.  Thus, it gets kinda crowded and difficult to quench one's thirst.  So drink early or wait often.  OR drink early AND wait often.

Waldorf is off the transit path but it's worth a looksee for those who like catching local bands or always dreamed of entering a room and be royally confused....in a good way.",2011-03-29T01:16:58Z,66

The streets are lined with homeless, drug addicts and dirty all over.  The parking is next to the hotel where  construction workers and  who knows what else hang around and space is limited. Needless to say, we ended up not staying at the hotel. We didn't care anymore about what we paid for the room, we just wanted to get away from there.

2885,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"Really you get what you pay for, so lower your expectations. I changed rooms twice because the A/C was working - but there was a loud audible whine associated with it. Anyway, once in the new room, there was a fridge, kettle, microwave and TV, free local calls and the WIFI worked good too - so I was all set.. Great value for money. I stayed 2 weeks at the Waldorf in Sept 2015, because I needed to be close to downtown Vancouver and Commercial Drive. Just the basics, but friendly staff, restaurant (try the Waldorf Pizza), Tiki bar and DJ nightclub on site. The niteclub has DJ's on Saturdays in the Tiki Room and no matter where you are staying in the hotel  - you will hear a low level bass thumping to 2 am in the morning. Also, if you you have a room on Mclean street (view of Post Office and Liquor store side), you'll hear truck and car noise all nite. A Starbucks just opened kitty-corner to the hotel, there's a discount grocery store across the street and a bus stop right outside to downtown Vancouver in 10 minutes. This hotel is NOT in downtown Vancouver - it's in East Vancouver... you'll have to go through the poorest neighbourhood in Canada to get to the hotel, but they keep the junkies (walking dead) out of the hotel.

2886,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"I came across the Waldorf Hotel when I was looking to see if any bands I knew of would be playing in town; coincidentally, Faust was to be playing at some point in October, I think it was, and Cult of Youth (one of my favorite bands) was performing the following week. Getting to Waldorf looked like it was going to be creepy (it just had a general air of danger to it), but once you actually talked to people, it was a little more comforting.

The drinks were pretty decent; cocktails were boozier than most other places I'd been to and were fairly priced (downstairs). Upstairs at the Tiki bar, the drinks were decent, but more expensive than downstairs. Probably due to the exotic theme. 

The actual concert-area is pretty small; if I recall correctly, it holds about 80-100 people if you're really pushing it. 

The first concert we went to (Faust), it was packed, and it honestly looked like I'd just stepped into an 80s horror movie. Most of the people were zombie-like, and the lead singer actually waved a chainsaw in my face at one point.

I didn't think anyone was going to show up to the second concert we went to as we were the only people there for the first hour or so. It did fill up eventually, but being the only two people there for so long, we were noticed by the band and hung out with them for most of the night. 

I haven't gone to any of their events (like the Ice Cream Social), but I'm planning on going to more of them--including the Halloween zombie thing they have going on in October.",2013-02-17T21:19:11Z,66

Had been here a couple times but never when the whole venue was open and had about 4 rooms going simultaneously. It was really busy but i never really felt to squished in anywhere. They had places to sit everywhere. The music was awesome and i found the staff to be nice also.

Incredibly noisy even on the ""quiet"" side of the hotel with not just music and bass from the club, but also constant street noise and pedestrians talking/yelling all night. There are no real shades in the room, so after a terrible night's sleep, we were awoken with sunlight pouring in. Front staff though is good and helpful. I paid about 200CAD for a Friday and Saturday night. Definite hygiene, health and cleanliness issues.

The staff was extremely helpful and accommodating, even helping us work through a couple of last minute changes to the night.   With no buy-out or rental fees for a group of 25 people it was also a fantastic deal!

One of the best parts about the venue is all the different spaces you can party in.  Dinner at Nuba is really amazing and the set menu they provided for us was excellent and more than enough food for everyone.  We were then able to use one of their rooms downstairs for a private video showing, and then move up to the Tiki bar for the rest of the party.  Everyone in our group had a blast and I'd highly recommend the venue to anyone planning a big night out with a bunch of friends, really for any occasion.",2011-08-27T16:34:37Z,66

(3) I also asked if there was a problem with their WiFi because it wouldn't connect while I was in the room, only in the hallway. I was told that they had never had any complaints of this and that if I had a contract with Shaw, that the signal would be overridden by that company. I do not have a contract with Shaw.

Comfortable bed, shower was okay, television got almost no channels. The room was right on the street and it was noisy. Traffic, crossing signal noise, people fighting - we barely got any sleep. If you're going to Vancouver to do the tourist thing then this is not the place to stay. Nothing around except a discount grocery store and a Tiki bar.

2898,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"Dinner and drinks at the Leeteg room followed by more drinks in the Tiki bar.

For a friend's birthday we had a pretty large group.  The service was quite excellent from our one waitress, however the auto-gratuity was 18%.  I totally understand auto grat for a large group, such as ours, but that's if the bill is all as one.  The lovely waitress separated our bills anyhow, so I'm not sure why restaurants think the auto grat is necessary in this case.  Despite that, 18% is a little steep.  If service is great, they get roughly 20%, but don't assume the service will be as such.  15% is a more reasonable amount for an auto gratuity, and if I want to leave more than that, I will.  In this case, I thought she did a great job, so I left a little more, but I was still not pleased with the establishment's assumptions.

On to the food...

Drinks in the Leeteg room were good, and prices not bad.  Food was okay on average.  I had the bean gazpacho, which was actually excellent.  I really enjoyed that, with it's garlic taste and creamy texture.  But the grilled veg on crispy bread was not as stellar.  The crispy bread failed to be crispy by the time it arrived since the veggies were quite moist.  The flavour was nice, but nothing amazing.  The prices for food are definitely not cheap.  I would have liked to have eaten more, but I wasn't about to pay more.

Drinks in the Tiki Bar were interesting...  

Super nice bartender, so plus point there.  However my bourbon sour was rather watery tasting, so minus points for that.  And other than some of the decor there really isn't anything Polynesian about the place.  It's kind of an odd space.  I sat with some friends to have my drink and after I got up to leave a waitress accosted me and said I needed to pay for my two drinks before I left.  I told her I had ordered at the bar, and she basically told me I was lying and was being very rude.  When she named the drink I had to point out my friend who indeed did order those.  She just said, ""oh, well you two look the same from the front.""  Nope, other than being white with dark hair.  Her hair being exceptionally curly and short, and mine long and straightish.  I understand being concerned that a patron may being trying to leave without paying, but she was very abrasive and rude about it, and didn't even offer an apology.  So minus points for her attitude.",2011-06-14T22:56:07Z,66
2899,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"Weird to be sure... Hadn't been since the 70s. Same sky on the ceiling possibly. Tiki Bar was in name only. They had NO DRAUGHT beer. Reason was the premises were original ie; old, and they didn't bother to change things apparently. Blue Buck by Philips was good. Must buy at beer store. But the menu was Lebanese of all things!! And the piped in music was Brasilian or summat. Good mix of appetizers. No mains offered. Gotta go next door for that. Was a Thursday and only a few other patrons on hand a couple of hours in (opens at 1800)... But we had to leave just prior to the tunes from 'Kevin', a delightful young man who knows his vinyl and 70s and 80s music, local and otherwise.

I've never seen anything quite like it.  Definitely a must do when in Vancouver.",2011-04-26T22:09:42Z,66
2901,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"It was my first time to the Waldorf since the renos.  I would say - cool place to check out.    We had a group of 8.  Cover was $15 on a Saturday night, but entry was disrupted between our group because they let in the VIP guests, so 4 of us were in, and the rest got in later.

The variety of music is great, so whomever you come with should enjoy themselves somewhere.  There was top 80s & hip hop, sock hop, rock in the 3 rooms when I went.  

The only problem we had was with the bartending in the tiki room.  My boyfriend and I were 2nd in line, and some girls went to the gap in between people milling around, and the male bartender automatically took their order first, being girls, I assume.  My boyfriend complained and got our drinks served at the same time, but they were made wrong.  We don't know if it was done purposely or not, but we were not impressed.  We got more drinks downstairs and there was not that problem.  It really dampens the night when you can't get a drink in a fair manner.  

The place is poorly light, which is normal, but we couldn't find our friends for most of the night.

2908,Hotel at the Waldorf,3.2,"So glad that the Waldorf has opened up again and is a lively destination in an otherwise dead stretch of Hastings. I'd been hearing much hoopla about Nuba but had never managed to make it to any of the locations. Finally a couple of friends and I were heading out for a girl's night and decided to give it a try. 

A cool retro room and an interesting mix of people. Main Street Hipsters in all their glory to normal folk just having a night out. And some chick who thought she was Lady Gaga. We had made reservations and would love to have had one of the booths on the edge of the room but instead were seated at a very badly placed table, right at the bottom of the stairs to the raised seating area and in the middle of the pathway from the kitchen/bar to the rest of the restaurant. it was like someone had moved the table their temporarily and forgotten to move it back. My friend sitting closest to the stairs was constantly bumped and knocked throughout the evening but customers and staff. We would have asked for a different table except they looked pretty full.  

Our first greeting by the bus person was not much of a greeting. No ""hello"" or any other words for that matter. Literally slammed three glasses down on the table, splooshed water into them, and walked away. We were all a bit stunned by this. His behaviour was pretty much the same when he came back for refills and to bus the table. We were definitely putting him out by being there. 

The restaurant was fairly busy as it was 8:00 on a Friday night. It took a while to get menus and drink orders taken but the server was pleasant, if not a bit rushed, and answered our questions well. 

We shared a couple of appies: the baba ghanooj and the crispy cauliflower. SO YUMMY. I dream about both of them. Very flavourful and fresh tasting. So we had high hopes for our mains. I ordered the Chicken Shish Tawook and my friends both ordered the Beef Tenderloin Kebabs. My chicken was very tender but very bland. The menu said it was marinated but I didn't taste any marinade at all and no spice either. Plus, no salt and pepper on the table. My friends both said the same thing about their beef, although theirs wasn't as tender. All three entrees were served with potatoes and a salad. The salad was standard and fine but the potatoes were greasy, cold and tough and seemed suspiciously like leftover breakfast homefries. 

For dessert we shared a rice pudding and a chocolate lava cake with mango ice cream. Both were quite good. The rice pudding had a creme brulee type hard sugar shell on top (yum!) and the chocolate lava cake was hot and gooey with lots of rich chocolate flavour and not too much sugar. 

Overall, I'll definitely give it another shot but probably won't go back to this location. The too-cool-for-school attitude was just a bit much to take. But it's also sort of what we expected. As for the menu, next time I think we would just order a variety of appies and do dinner that way since they were so tasty.

2911,Hilton Vancouver Airport,3.4,"Good things:

1. Room was clean and in good condition, just about what we'd expect as a brand at this level.

2. Parking was reasonably priced. A little bit over $20 CAD or about $15 USD.

However there're several issues during our one-night stay:

1. The room 1618 was registered as two queen beds in the system, and we selected the room because of this. Turned out that it was just two double beds. The front desk also confirmed that the room should be two queen beds. Either they have wrong info in the system, or their ""queen"" is just as small as a regular double. So we paid for a two-queen room but ended up getting two-double.

2. The bottled water in the room tastes almost toxic. It has a very stale taste, just like contaminated water being left for a few weeks. Tap water tasted better than that.

3. The so-called ""heated pool"" is barely heated. It is hotter than no heating at all, but not heated enough to stay in comfortably. The pool was also not staffed at all and there was no towel. (There was supposed to be towel but when it was out, no one replenishes.)",2024-02-28T20:12:25Z,68
2912,Hilton Vancouver Airport,3.4,"Horrible customer service at front desk. Asian guy at the front desk essentially ignored me the entire time as I waited in line. I finally walked up to him to see if he was free but he told me to get back in line and went to help the couple behind me, who had arrived AFTER me. The couple was nice enough to tell him I was before them. No apologies or anything from him. I hope he stubs his toe every morning for the rest of his life henceforth. 

The parking structure is designed horribly. We couldn't find an elevator in the garage, only saw stairs. The other front desk person explained it to us after we walked around confused for a while how to get around. I'm still confused honestly. Saw another person also walking around confused. 

The rooms are tiny unless you're getting a suite. Don't believe the pictures online. Nice use of the wide angle lens because rooms are way smaller in person. 

The elevators take forever to go up or down. We waited close to 7-8 mins on the 18th floor. When we finally got on the person already in the elevator asked if we had been waiting long. Apparently he waited 10 mins or so to get 
on. 

The hotel room had a broken handle for the closet door. 

No microwave in the room fyi 

Just throw the whole hotel away. Including that front desk agent. 

The only upside to this hotel is the location. It's surrounded by walkable restaurants and shops.

2925,Hilton Vancouver Airport,3.4,"After a delayed flight and missed connection resulted in an overnight layover in Vancouver, I made a last-minute, same-day reservation at this hotel in early May 2018. There's a free shuttle service to and from the Vancouver Airport to the hotel, which was really convenient. I was able to use the HiltonHonors points that I'd accrued in the States to purchase the room. Upon check-in, I was upgraded to a very comfortable suite on the 18th floor, which included 2 TVs, a sitting room with a desk and sofa, a large bed, and a well-appointed bathroom. The wi-fi worked fine for me.

I arrived at the hotel just before 10 pm and was able to order room service from the full dining menu right before it closed. I ordered a chicken breast dinner with veggies and fries; with delivery, tip, and no extras/drinks/desserts, it cost about $30. The chicken was a bit bland and dry, but it was filling and basically what I expected from a hotel restaurant. There is a late-night menu starting at 10 pm that is available all night, but it seems to be limited to more snack-type foods. The in-room TV seemed to have a lot of channels, including a couple of French-language ones. 

The 24-hour free shuttle service to the Vancouver Airport was really handy. The shuttle ran every 30 minutes and took maybe 15-20 minutes to get to the airport. All the staff I encountered were friendly and polite. The room and amenities were what I'd come to expect from the brand and were consistent with those that I'd seen in the States; the familiarity was really welcome after a hectic and exhausting day of delayed/missed flights and various timezone changes.",2018-06-10T16:00:54Z,68

I was happy with the breakfast at first especially the made to order omelettes. Very nice addition to a continental breakfast. It all went south when I ate some granola and yogurt. The granola was rancid--VERY RANCID. You could smell it. We alerted the gentleman who seated us (not sure if he was a manager). Instead of being horrified and apologizing, he got defensive and said the granola was house made. That's when the man seated next to us piped in to agree with us. He also found the granola to be rancid. I didn't see them immediately pull it off the line which is what they should have done. 

I wouldn't come back here. I can still taste that granola.",2019-07-17T11:19:04Z,68
2929,Hilton Vancouver Airport,3.4,"I really enjoyed this hotel while we were in Richmond as it was close to number 3 road which is the main drive through town and was within walking distance to many restaurants if you didn't feel like driving. The hotel was very nice and modern looking throughout from the lobby and to the rooms.

As I was recognized from the front desk when I checked in as a HH member, they gave us free breakfast for me and my wife plus also free parking for the one night we were staying there. This was totally unexpected and just made we felt grateful for being an honors member. What a nice gesture to start out our vacation. 

Our room was nice and wasn't too small for the two of us. It had a mini fridge and microwave plus a coffee maker. The big tv was a little too big for the room as it cover most of a whole wall. The bathroom was a little small, but ok for just getting in and out. The bedroom was very nice with nice linens and the bed itself was comfy. Even though they said it was close to the airport I couldn't here much of any airplane noise and was able to sleep soundly through the night. Other amenities we were able to try out were the workout room and jacuzzi. Both were very good and nicely equipped. They also have an outdoor heated pool which we didn't try as it was just too cold outside.

After staying at quite a few hotels throughout Richmond, this has been the best I've stayed at through the many times I've been here. Great service throughout from check in and out.",2018-11-02T00:02:14Z,68
2930,Hilton Vancouver Airport,3.4,"This is an update from previous review based on 5 nite stay, Dec 2014.

Vancouver Hilton is my preferred stay when in Vancouver

Upper floor rooms now undergoing renovation.

Pluses:
* Complimentary Airport Shuttle 2x hourly. Departs to airport 25 and 55 mins on the hour. Early and late.
* Usual comfy Hilton beds
* Clean hotel
* Friendly, helpful staff
* Buffet breakfast with fruit, juice, and Starbucks coffee included. Can order eggs your way too as part of buffet. Medwin, a breakfast server, will make you smile with his infectious enthusiasm.
* 8-10 mins walk to Canada Line SkyTrain. Then 25-30 mins to Waterfront/downtown
* New Cavu restaurant and bar is refurbished and modern décor
* Several beers on tap including fine Stanley Park Amber Ale. But size seems chintzy at about 10 oz
* Courtesy Starbucks coffee in the lobby.  Early only; removed by about 8:30 am.

Tips:
* From Airport, you don't need to call for shuttle pickup. Shuttle arrives airport about 10 mins after and 40 mins after each hour. Shuttle bus shared with nearby Marriott and Sheraton.
* Upgrades in this hotel are worthwhile with suite, corner unit.
* Request northern view.
* For best value, negotiate your rate to include breakfast, Wi-Fi, and parking if you need it.

Small Gripes:
* Wi-Fi require daily log-in. Annoying with 3 devices. Worked reliably once logged in.
* Still missing is a Hilton Executive Lounge
* Bar bourbon selection is limited...only Jack Daniels and Makers Mark. 
* Balcony on some units is good for a view, but too small for even a small chair. Practically unusable.",2014-12-09T16:55:08Z,68
2931,Hilton Vancouver Airport,3.4,"Stayed here for a little staycation while back to school shopping. It was clean, the roof top pool on the fifth floor was awesome, and it was walking distance to the mall and some restaurants. 

The rooms weren't anything special, nor was the location, but I've stayed in many hotels and what took the cake was the customer service, specifically a young lady named Adrienne (spelling?). I actually called earlier in the day to inquire about an early check in and to see if the pool was open and she was so friendly and thorough. When we got to the hotel, she recognized my voice from the phone call, complimented the kids and gave them some snacks and pop. 

She was so friendly and had exactly the demeanour that every front desk staff at hotels should have.

If we ever do this again, we will for sure choose this hotel.",2020-08-24T02:11:08Z,68
2932,Hilton Vancouver Airport,3.4,"I can't say enough nice things about this Hilton. 
First let me tell you that we had a medical emergency with my son that forced us to stay over an extra night in Canada. We needed a place to rest and they allowed us do check in really early!  That was so great.  Later that day my wife tripped on the messed up sidewalks and Sharon the manager was so kind. She applied first aid and even personally brought us up some ice packs to the room. 
I would definitely recommend this hotel.",2018-07-01T03:34:26Z,68
2933,Hilton Vancouver Airport,3.4,"Friendly front desk, location has good Chinese restaurants nearby and a mall.  The gym is cute, good dumbbells, three cardio machines, jacuzzi and sauna.  The restaurant has a limited menu, mostly empty, breakfast buffet is not exciting.  Considering this rich diverse area, there is plenty of room for improvement.   Update the television monitors on the cardio equipment.   

Room is fantastic; soft pillows, comfortable yet small bathroom, living room is the best.   Bed is comfortable; love the thick curtains.   Room is well furnished.",2016-05-20T20:53:55Z,68
2934,Hilton Vancouver Airport,3.4,"My boyfriend and I spent the night here in a 1 bedroom king bedroom suite with a corner building view and a cute mini balcony. The room is so beautiful!

 The hilton just recently renovated their hotel so everything is almost new. I was so impressed by the decor of the room and the view! Bedding was comfortable and clean!!! Big plus! Bathroom is kind of small but I've realize all hilton bathrooms are small. (Come on Paris! Hook us up with bigger bathrooms lol) other then that, the lighted mirror in the bathroom caught my eye. The room also had two big flat screen tvs; One in the bedroom and one in the living. 

Also, the Hilton is conveniently located literally right across the street from the mall and there are a lot of good restaurants open late a night. If you're feeling a bit lazy, room service is 24/7! 

Cons: the halls reeked! Smells like dirty toilet. Parking garage is kind of scary and seems sketchy.
Pros: comfy, clean and homey feeling. Super duper friendly staff!

This hotel will definitely be in my ""must stay at again"" list!",2015-06-09T06:20:41Z,68
2935,Hilton Vancouver Airport,3.4,"Is not the best,  room service sucks, I stay five night and they change my sheets once, the night before I supposed to leave, very dusty,  I ordered room service and they didn't bring the whole order only half,  their prices for food at their restaurant were to expensive you have to go somewhere else to",2019-03-19T10:03:37Z,68
2936,Hilton Vancouver Airport,3.4,"I can't fully understand the overall mediocre rating for this hotel.  It's located in a moneyed Chinese-heavy and strikingly clean area of Vancouver.  Characteristic of Hiltons everywhere, the shuttles are abundant, regular and efficient though you must wait for the Sheraton and Marriott customers to disembark first.  I couldn't help notice a new Lamborghini parked in the general outdoor lot for visitors driving in that solicited very little attention.   

The lobby contains a Chinese real estate office for some reason that you will pass on your way to the front desk from the parking garage facing sliding glass doors where the shuttle drops you off.  A clean, well-decorated ground floor opens past the elevators and check-in to an on-site restaurant called Cavu.  This Hilton has a pantry as well, where you can pick up a sandwich, salad, candy, chips, a few freezer items or toiletries if you don't feel like venturing out, though the area feels safe and other dining options abound.  

They gave me an amazing 16th floor room facing the mountains with sunlight streaming into the bedroom and down the hall and into the living room / work desk.  This Hilton is notably well-decorated and offers a mini-frig and microwave which is not common at all.  The room comes with two free water bottles and a third that will cost you $4.50 CAD if you remove it.  Wi-fi at Hilton chains comes in complimentary and higher speed flavors which is awesome compared to the days where it cost $12 or nothing.  The bed was heavenly.  I slept so well which I almost never do at home let alone in hotels!  The luxury will cost you, though.  Hilton Vancouver set me back $268 for the night.",2015-06-11T14:35:56Z,68
2937,Hilton Vancouver Airport,3.4,"6 days in Vancouver. 
Got a good rate at the Hilton. 
It was a 3 block walk to the skytrain.
Room was clean and large.
Nice view from the 16th floor.
No 4th or 13th floor, so it really was the 14th floor.
Location was OK, and the rate was just right.
Coffee was available each morning at the lobby.
Cupcakes and water were available each afternoon at the lobby.
Nice shuttle to and from the airport twice each hour at 0:25 and 0:55 was convenient.",2017-07-20T03:34:01Z,68
2938,Hilton Vancouver Airport,3.4,"Hilton always takes care of us. I asked for an upgrade and they were able to accommodate my family. We stayed here for a couple days and the whole time the front desk took care of us. They kept giving us free water no matter how much we asked haha! House keeping was incredible too. She would always make sure we were taken care of every morning. Downstairs is a bar and restaurant. We got free breakfast every morning, which was delicious. The location is near the airport and about 15 mins from downtown Vancouver. The only probably I had was that my digital key on my phone didn't work sometimes, which I don't really care about. Thank you Hilton Vancouver! We will see you guys again!!!",2019-01-09T18:32:15Z,68
2939,Hilton Vancouver Airport,3.4,"This is a top-notch business travelers facility.  I was upgraded to a deluxe suite with two flat screen LCDs, very comfy bed, clean bathroom.

The check-in process was flawless.  I was lost coming from the airport, yes, but I blame google maps.  I called the desk, they gave me flawless directions to the place.  Then on arrival, I'm worried about travel from the hotel to the place where I'll be working in the morning.  The gent at the desk gave me the clearest route, beating google by about 25 turns.

The fitness room is as the earlier reviewer said, very limited.  There is a treadmill, an elliptical and an exercise bike.  There are free weights, but very little room.

The breakfast is pretty good.  My HHonors status gives me a free continental.  The oatmeal, croissant and fruit are all fresh and good.",2009-09-30T20:07:47Z,68
2940,Hilton Vancouver Airport,3.4,"Recently stayed here in a suite for 3 nights as part of a large group of parents and our Atom Rep hockey players in town for the Richmond Spring Classic Tournament. 

Cons
Near non-existent wifi which has resulted in me incurring large data fees. One expects more than this from a brand like Hilton. Really a disgrace. 

The love seat pullout couch in our living room area was absolutely pathetic. Not fit for a frat house or homeless vagrants' tent city camp. This may have been the most uncomfortable piece of furniture that I've ever had the misfortune to experience. Indeed, this love seat would make an excellent addition to any military, police or intelligence organization's interrogation and torture techniques or repertoire. Having a prisoner sit on this torturous piece of ""furniture"" would surely result in him singing like a canary in no time! They may well be employing this type of love seat (aka torture tool) 
already in the gulags of Russia, CIA black sites, ISIS prison camps or narco torture dungeons. I have no doubt that this love seat could be a candidate for being added to the Geneva Convention list of banned weapons it is so uncomfortable! Again, for a Hilton branded hotel to have this in one of their rooms is embarrassing and disgraceful. 

Lighting in the room is inadequate and very dark. Felt cavelike. 

Suite was always very hot/warm even when we turned the temperature down to 62F and opened the windows. Hallways in the building were also very hot and stifling. 

No microwave. We have stayed in many hotels over the years and in our experience, most, particularly suites or Mini-suites have microwaves. Would be very helpful for leftovers from restaurant meals. 

Bartenders in the Cava restaurant and bar, while providing decent order taking and delivery service, are amateurish. It's never a good sign when a bartender has no clue what a negroni is. Both the bartenders we had on different nights also displayed considerable confusion when it came time to provide us with our bills. They seemed to have very little recollection of what each person had ordered. 

Elevators could be slow at times. A building this size when at full capacity should probably have 3 elevators rather than 2. Things got really annoying when 1 of the elevators broke down for a good portion of one of the days we were staying. 

2 double beds in bedroom rather than 2 queens which we had requested. 

Pros
Location is fantastic with a plethora of restaurants and eating options surrounding the building within easy walking distance. The local Chinese food is amazing! There is also a decent sized shopping center/mall within 2 blocks. 

Smaller size rooftop heated pool deck is quite nice and very enjoyable even in March. Gets lots of sun and pool is nicely heated. 

Staff were all polite, helpful and courteous. 

Lots of parking spots in the adjoining parkade that was included in our nightly rate. 

Room rate was reasonable and included a large room provided to the team to store our equipment. 

2 large flatscreens in our suite plus a mini fridge. 

Nightly happy hour 9pm to 12am in the bar in Cava was wonderful. Just don't order a negroni!
Rooms had good chest of drawers to store clothes in during your stay. We also had a great view from our floor to ceiling corner window on the 11th floor! 

Bathroom had nice granite counter tops, but shower and tub were only slightly better than average. 

Given the location and good room rate, Might return in future should we travel to Richmond for hockey again and they make improvements to the wifi and furnishings.",2018-03-21T04:40:26Z,68

This property just reminded me yet again why I'm reducing my Hilton stays.  First, I was a ghost upon check in.  I wasn't acknowledged by anyone at the front desk for at least 15 minutes.  Next? While I was checking in, the front desk guy stops to arrange a taxi for someone else.  Then, get to my room, it's cold, I turn up the heat, head to dinner which was poor food quality at best and even less impressive wait staff.  Then, I return to no heat in my room.  They offered me another room and a meal voucher.  When I brought to their attention I already ate and checking out prior to the next meal, I got a ""oh, ok"".  I won't be back to this place.

Hotel location is meh. I only stayed here because everywhere downtown was completely booked, but I have to say, my stay was pretty good. Self parking was a breeze, just be sure to go slowly in the structure because not everyone does, and those corners can be a you-know-what. Room was comfortable, internet worked great, I didn't get to take advantage of the hotel dining due to my schedule - but I did pick up a grab-and-go wrap, which was good.

Only stayed here for a weekend,  but everything was great and just very stress free. Check-in was a breeze and they let us check in at 11 am, which was awesome because we had to get ready for a wedding.

They gave us a corner suite so it was very spacious.  The bed was really comfortable and the pillows were soft and fluffy.  But what I was really impressed with was how soft the bed sheets and bath towels were - not that rough scratchy material that's usually at hotels.  It actually seemed like they used fabric softener - and who doesn't love fabric softener!! 

At night, I realized I forgot my toothbrush so I called the front desk and they promptly brought me a toothbrush.  I tried to tip the guy, but he wouldn't accept it, which surprised me. So professional and courteous. 

Overall, we had a really pleasant stay.  It was close to the airport and close to the freeways and everyone was very nice and accommodating.  Also, the parking lot elevator goes directly to the hotel's 2nd floor which made things even more convenient.

I ended up in a junior suite, which was nice... but very odd. There was a 3 sq ft porch accessed via a large security door, tight spaces filled with furniture next to open and empty areas, and a ""foyer"" area that required a second door to unlock. The room and hotel felt very odd and out of place. 

Being next to the airport you'd expect some good sound proofing, but this was much louder than other airport hotels I've stayed at.

This one is about 5 mins from the airport - one of the better hotels in the area for business travel.  Location is on Minoru, close to Westminster Hwy and about a 5 min walk from Richmond Centre and the hospital.

Conference rooms are of moderate size but better insulated for sound than the nearby Delta that I had been in recently.  Food service was solid for the conference portion.  Food quality is OK - I'm partial to food at the Fairmont for meetings, but this is fine and may be more reflective of the limited budget by the organization hosting the meeting.

Toiletries are consistent with all Hilton's and rooms have a flat-screen TV.  The rooms do not have wireless, which means one must work sitting at the desk using the wired connection. Seems pretty behind the times for a hotel in Vancouver.  Key entry from parkade, so you will need to checkin before bringing in bags from car. Fitness club far below par.

2971,Hilton Vancouver Airport,3.4,"The Hilton Vancouver Airport is the best place to stay near-by the airport. With a location so close to the airport, the shuttle ride is barely 5-10 minutes long. The shuttle bus is shared between three hotels. (Hilton, Marriott, and Sheraton) The shuttle drivers are very courteous. When the bus is filled up with people, the bus drivers will direct the customers to the Richmond Taxis, and when they arrive at their hotel, the hotel will provide a taxi voucher. This means you basically get a bus ride, but inside a taxi for free. With its central location, the hotel is nearby the Richmond Centre, an Avis and Enterprise, and many other shops. When you need to wrap up the day, the rooms will accommodate your needs. With the rooms newly renovated, the rooms have great curb-appeal. The beds are very soft, the pillows well match the beds, and the rooms also have a couch bed. The bathroom is clean, and all your body essentials are provided. (Be sure to bring your own as back-up) There is a gym, pool, and tennis court on the fifth level. Along with the kind lobby staff, there is also a little shop to get your water or food in the lobby, right across from a misplaced reality shop. In the end, the Hilton Vancouver Airport is a great place to stay either if you need to have your family sleep  the night in beautiful Vancouver.",2015-04-18T04:10:29Z,68

The hotel itself was old and scary.  The location is awful and the rooms are dark.  Super bad lighting, especially in the bathroom where you need the best light.  We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite and the living room was extremely uninviting.  The couches were old and dirty looking.  I only used the desk and that was it.

The staff was very helpful and friendly. The place was well kept and clean for the most part. It was only one morning I noticed the bathroom floor in one of the stalls needed cleaning but I was impressed by how well built the stalls were made. My other complaint is the place really needs a much larger kitchenette with so many people staying there at any given time. I didn't receive a shoe locker because mine had not been fixed yet which was disappointing but the staff apologized. Just an observation the kitchenette could use more supply and varieties of teas and other sweetners for guests to enjoy.,2023-09-29T02:59:59Z,9

The pods were bigger than I thought, and the three lockers + shelf in the pod gives plenty of room for storage. The mattresses and pillows were comfy. The shoeless + free slippers policy was a very nice touch.

Can't beat the price, either.

2982,Panda Pod Hotel,4.1,"I'm lying in my pod writing this review even though I haven't spent a night sleeping here yet. Well the mattress is on the thin side but I'm lying on top of the comforter which gives you some more padding. So far it feels comfy but I'll find out how I slept tomorrow morning. You have all your basic amenities like toilet, showers, soap dispenser, hair dryer, towel/slipper service, kitchen/eating area with microwave & hot water dispenser, cutlery/dishes/cups, snack vending machine but no fridge. Storage wise your shoes & carry on are stored at the front hallway & my large backpack fit snugly in a locker underneath the pod. All the lockers use a fob system which each person is given at check in. And you know they are all about customer service because I asked about checking out early in the morning to catch my flight and the attendant asked if I required a taxi just like at a 5* hotel. Unless something drastically goes wrong overnight I'm definitely recommending this place. Everyone should at least try once sleeping in these pods unless you are claustrophobic then maybe not for you.",2019-09-24T01:25:23Z,9
2983,Panda Pod Hotel,4.1,"I stayed here a few times while visiting Vancouver. It is very clean, quiet, no frill accommodation that I really appreciated.

2984,Panda Pod Hotel,4.1,"Found this place online and am so grateful they were the first and only phonecall i needed to make after missing a flight during a big snowstorm and requiring a place to stay for the night. Super friendly owner on the phone answered all my questions; then, upon my arrival, was so kind & helpful, offering me hot tea, chatting with me, filling me in on the history of her pod /capsule hotel and showing me to my pod with a tour of the place. All this while i waited briefly for the delicious food to be delivered by the Asian restaurant next door.
    The quiet of the place was so appreciated, the natural latex mattress in my pod was so perfect and comfy, i felt like i was sleeping in my own bed at home. 
    3 different size electronically controlled lockers for stashing your things are cool....all triggered open by an electronic key fob given you with the number corresponding to the number of your pod.
   The spaciousness and room inside the capsule is plentiful, never leaving me feeling crowded, tight and claustrophobic..... just a perfect size for one person to feel totally at home.
    The pod/capsule doesnt close...it has 3 walls, a ceiling and then the opening through which you enter ( being as big as the wall behind your head/pillow) has a paper retracting shade down by your feet you can pull down to block out all light or offer more privacy in the even another person is walking past to or from their bed/pod.
    i didnt need to use the little fold out table that comes out of the wall inside each pod ( for writing or computer work, etc.)  but it was nice to see how someone thought of that and used the space within the pod so brilliantly.
    The male and female wings are separate, as are the clean/warm bathrooms, complete with spacious and strong hot showers.
    I feel i just cant say enough about the place. It was a dream to find, not to mention so ultra affordable. There weren't many folks staying on the night i did, but i did get a warm people vibe there, tasting of community as one might find in a youth hostel. That too was a good feeling.
     I took a foto of the pod inside, which i have posted along with this review.  Thanks for reading and thank you to the lovely lady owner/manager Sharon who was so gracious and welcoming :)",2020-03-01T20:41:48Z,9

They had decent prices for my budget that I wasn't intending on spending. They accommodated my needs right away, and was very friendly.

For the hotel, is a bit crowded reception area and the bar on the side has live music so if you arrive on dinner time it will be loud. 
Rooms are clean, nice bed, I meant nice because was a firm type and I loved it. All the amenities where nicely accommodated including the coffee maker.

2990,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"The pros of the hotel - the staff is very friendly, and the location is great. You can walk to many restaurants, Stanley Park, etc. And it's dog friendly!

The cons - only 1 elevator was working the whole time we were there, and looking back at reviews, it's been this way for a while. There was always a long wait for the elevator. We ended up taking the narrow and dark stairs to our 4th floor room most of the time. Other guests were also using the stairs, but they were so narrow, you'd have to step out into the hallway to let people pass. What a pain! 

I don't know who decided to put all the dogs on the 4th floor, but, let me tell you, when your dog is traveling and off their regular schedule, and they start whining to go potty, and your choice is a 15 minute wait for the elevator or climbing flights uo and down a dark and narrow stairway as fast as you can, well, you've gotta make some tough choices. 

I also found the entranceway to always be cramped - we were trying to navigate in and out with luggage, around other people's dogs, around the long line for the elevator, and the automatic doors opening and closing on us constantly, and it was just annoying! 

The room itself was fine, except... there was this weird large hole under the window area. At first, it was uncovered and our dog kept trying to reach something under there. (Who knows? Who wants to know?) We ended up asking the front desk for a solution and they gave us some towels to stuff under there. Which, solved the problem, in a way, but what the heck?",2022-07-10T15:22:42Z,61
2991,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"Regret coming here. Thought it was going to be a nice weekend for us, wrong. My boyfriends frat rented out a few floors for their annual formal and needless to say we had a bad experience. 
Second day in we noticed paw prints on one of the beds (we don't have pets), meaning they didn't change the sheets before we came to stay here. We're also allergic to dogs so we've been suffering all weekend and we're both really grossed out by it. We love dogs but we just don't like sharing sheets with strangers. 
Prime reason of our upset is the fact that I got food poisoning from the pub downstairs. Had a basic breakfast and a smoothie there and something had to have gone bad because the food poisoning set in within hours. Been throwing up every 30 minutes and we can't even enjoy the last day of our trip now because I'm in such bad shape my boyfriend has had to take care of me. When I called the front desk to talk to a manager to A. Let them know that whoever ""cleaned"" our room before we came in doesn't do their job right and B. Let them know I got food poisoning from something in their kitchen (I used to work in food service so I didn't attack them for getting me sick , mostly just telling them they should probably check the expiration dates on their food so nobody else gets sick) there wasn't a manager or supervisor on the premises. You would think that there would be at least somebody in charge here during the weekends, especially since they had 50 couples rent out a huge portion of the rooms. 
Whenever I come back here I will absolutely not be coming back or recommend this place to anyone and will be telling the fraternity to not book here next year. It would be nice if the hotel could try to compensate for them getting me sick but again there's nobody in charge for me to talk to about that so",2023-06-04T02:22:37Z,61

2993,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,The hotel is within walking distance to Stanley Park and Robson street for shopping and restaurants and has convenient amenities.  The hotel room with the garden view is not worth the $400+ price tag if you are a light sleeper.  The music from the restaurant across the water sounds like a night club.  And the patron's conversations is clearly audible from the outdoor dining area below.  It all looks great during the day but when it is time to turn in you can forget about sleeping for several hours.  Apparently I read the wrong reviews.  The hotel room with the garden view isn't worth the high price tag.  If you need peace and quiet this hotel disappointingly cannot provide that to you.  .,2023-09-08T04:04:48Z,61
2994,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,Stayed here for a Just got Laughs comedy festival in February 2023 and I guess the joke was on us.   We had bed bugs.  We only spent the night but that was enough.

Sheldon at the front desk, especially, wouldn't waste a single moment and delivered any request within seconds. The room was also very clean, and basically had everything we needed. However, the one downside was that we needed to request to have body lotion, shampoo, and conditioner in the room. Otherwise, showers would have only consisted of water. Nevertheless, I had requested both an early check-in, and as nice a view as possible. Staff made sure both requests were completed at their finest caliber which I greatly appreciated.",2023-06-12T05:04:19Z,61
2996,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"Stayed there for a few days, the location is great and the rooms look nice. First, we found a bed-bug on a wall, did not know it's a bed bug, we had never seemed them before. We tried to kill it, it didn't want to die‍, took it to the front desk and asked who is it. The front desk wasn't sure, they called maintenance. The maintenance said that it's a bed bug and started to convince us that we brought it with ourselves. Seriously, man?!! Our luggage, which were two backpacks, always kept them under my bed. If it had any bedbugs, they would bite me at home, not in your hotel. So they ended up changing our room, to the one which had broken fridge and the whole night drunk people from downstairs bar were singing, flirting and yelling like crazy. We were with small children, no one could sleep at night. Next day they moved us to a different room, it was another disaster night, our room was joined with someone's else room, and that people were very loud. Most likely they were drunk as well. First they were knocking the door and walls, and then they got tired and started snoring so loud, like grizzly bears. No sleep for two nights in a row. Just FYI no apologies from the stuff, they did change the rooms, but who cares if the new room was worse than previous, bottom line: we couldn't get any sleep at night. At check out they told me that they can waive the parking fee, which was already free for me as a gold members.  I just want to say SERIOUSLY people? I always travel with best western, but this one just sucks. So much work after the stay at this hotel. Already sprayed the backpacks and clothes for bedbugs and now need to deep clean them and heat for 1 hours at high temperature after the stay.

I complained to the front desk and it was cleaned up the next day (I took the liberty of racking the weights myself on the day of).  Cardio machines were not working, but that was corrected as well.

Did laundry my last night there and the washer's spin cycle did not work properly so the clothes were a little damp.  The dryer I used did not dry the clothes properly in 60 min so I had to use the other dryer and within 45 min were dry.

Room was nice and beds were comfy, but was noisy due to our room facing the street, but there was a noise ordinance notification posted in the lobby for customers due to road construction.

3001,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"Best Western motels are just slightly tarted up Motel 6s at double the price and that's being generous, but this review isn't about the motel side of this location, it's about the pub/restaurant.  Let's start with the location, near the corner of Denman and Davie in English Bay, you really can't get a more central spot, lots of shops, lots of people (and not all of them are tourists, but a lot of them are) and just a few steps from English Bay and the beach.  When visiting 'The Sands' as it's known by the locals, you don't even really need to go inside the motel part (except to use the bathroom).  A pretty standard pub/restaurant with all the mandatory TV sets and lots of room inside and a few more tables outside, it doesn't stand out too much in any respect.  

So why the 5 stars?  Well, they have some pretty great daily drink and food specials, like two apps for $12 or beer and highball specials that will make you want to stay just a little longer. Here's the scenario, you take your bike around the Stanley Park seawall, maybe stop on one of the big grassy fields and toss a frisbee for a bit, then make your way along English Bay to see some of the street performers and finally find a seat at The Sands outdoor patio.  Here you sip on a few drink specials and maybe some food as you enjoy the Vancouver sunset, now what could be more 5 stars than that?",2017-06-30T02:08:48Z,61
3002,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"I have to make a high recommendation of the staff at the Sands Best Western in Vancouver, Canada at English Bay. 
We live in Vancouver but it was my 1st time there. Our Tuesday night started mistakenly slow as we arrived an hour and a half before karaoke started. The bar manager, Brad, convinced us to stay by offering my cousin and I each a drink on the house. We ended up staying and singing our hearts out! We had SUCH A GREAT TIME!
We made friends with guests staying at the hotel who were flying out the next morning to Saskatoon and Brisbane, respectively. We danced the night away the DJ was superb but at the end of the night we realized that my cell phone had been taken. It was disheartening. We couldn't imagine any of the people there or around us would do that... the vibe there seemed more mature. Since we had so much fun it was even more of a violation to discover the phone was taken right from under us, possibly while we were on stage singing a duet.
My cousin left her number with the front desk, we informed the bouncer and Brad of the situation and left. 
All day Wednesday I spent locking my device, setting lock mode on Find My iPhone, and feeling betrayed. 
By Thursday, I had a new SIM card and was borrowing my aunt's extra old phone when suddenly my cousin calls to say the hotel manager, Eddie called and to phone him back because someone returned an iPhone but he wasn't sure if it was mine.
I got down there right away and Eddie had my iPhone held strongly in his hand until I entered my password to ensure it was in fact my phone (which I really appreciated) 
He explained that a male patron came there to drop it off and told the front desk he must've brought it home by mistake because he was intoxicated.
Obviously I was thrilled! But it wouldn't have happened unless all the team at the Sands Best Western pulled together to keep their eyes and ears open and contacted us.
Thank you Brad, Eddie, the bouncer, the DJ, the front desk staff and the person who brought back my phone. You're all outstanding. WE'LL BE BACK!",2018-11-16T06:13:17Z,61

3004,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"Staff was excellent, couldn't have been better. Parking was not great. Room didn't even have thermostat controled central air, had to use wall unit air conditioner that was being covered by windowshade. When windowshade was moved for air conditioning, sun comes blazing into room at 6am while sleeping. Not what you would expect for the price.

PS. 
I would REALLY not recommend Vancouver in general. My wife and I sat in hours of ridiculous traffic, during the traffic jam I was cut-off in an intersection and as a result my car was assaulted by a 'maniac cop' who was apparently was upset because I didn't drive into the car that cut me off. So he punched my car and verbally abused me (forget the fact that I clearly had New York license plates and was a tourist on vacation and had no idea where I was and was just trying to get through a crazy traffic jam without breaking any laws). 

The next day we decided to visit Stanley Park, well things didn't go any better there. We drove in and parked in the Native American Totem Pole area at the park's east end. As you can see from my pics, there are no signs anywhere alerting unaware tourists that the parking is payed. We got back to our car and had a parking ticket (in a park).

On our exit from the park we got lost and I had to check my phone for directions. Since I was driving I stopped and pulled over as much as I could to temporarily check my directions, since the road was not busy and I didn't want to drive distracted and kill someone. Withing 30 seconds the park police pulled up behind me and treated me as if I had robbed a bank. He demanded to know why I had stopped and before I could explain told me I needed to start driving and I couldn't stop for any reason whatsoever (by the way this was a double lane road with hardly and traffic on it). 

My wife and I were on a month long road trip this summer. In the last two years we have visited more than 40 different cities in the US and Canada and never had any experience even close to this. In fact we had been on the road for a total of 3 weeks up to this point and never even had any interaction with police and in the span of 24 hours in Vancouver had two extremely negative interactions.

Outside of the obvious problems with police the people here also just seemed unfriendly and weirdly hostile. We didn't get a very friendly vibe from this place at all. In general, I would not recommend Vancouver as a place to visit.",2015-09-14T18:49:20Z,61

3007,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"We very much enjoyed our stay. Staff was very pleasant and accommodating. Daily food specials were a great bargain and quite yummy. Actually, all the food we were served at their restaurant was great and very ample portion sizes too. 

Bathroom was small, but wonderful shower-looks recently updated. Room was very clean and comfortable. 

Very convenient to the beaches and the seawalk. The stroll around Stanley Park took us over an hour with lovely views along the way - a definite must for tourists. Walked in the other direction and found the water taxis and cruised around False Creek - also fun.",2019-09-13T18:33:33Z,61
3008,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"Unfornatuly, in the last year this place has went down hill. We stayed here in 2018 for Seawheeze and it was priced right and great customer service. This year, for Seawheeze, I ended up paying more than a 5 star hotel (friend stayed at Sutton). Our refrigerator was broken, balcony has loose boards and completely unusable, the main door does not shut completely without the help of the chain lock. They updated the bathroom with a shower only, but the door to the bathroom doesn't shut. There was no ice machine on our floor we had to go to the 1st/3rd. The air condition barely worked and is so loud. Also, we are on the side where there is a bar- be fair warned loud live music Friday nights, and loud customers leaving Saturday. Just completely bummed, this was such a nice place last year. Won't be back.",2019-08-18T14:43:20Z,61
3009,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"We got 2 Queen beds overlooking the city and boy was it a view. Hotel wasn't too bad, we got parking and free WiFi. Bed for decently comfortable where you can get a good nights rest and not wake up with back problems. Staff were nice and friendly. Overall experience for the price it was well worth it. We would definitely come back again.",2019-10-11T10:24:35Z,61
3010,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"I travel alot and I must say the location of this hotel is one of the best. Staff is friendly and good at listening and help. Close to the location, you can Hop On and Off the Vancouver Trolley. Very neat visit of the city even under pouring rain.

3011,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"The Best Western Plus Sands is my go- to place when staying in Vancouver. It has it all. Great location, great rooms, easy to find, top notch restaurant (breakfast is my fave!) and above all, the most amazing and friendly staff. It was my first time back here since covid hit, and I'd like to add that they are doing a phenomenal job, given the climate we are currently in. If you want a great place to stay, near a lot of other great places, I highly recommend booking your next room here!",2020-10-28T02:45:51Z,61

3014,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"We stayed here after a cruise. It was a short and inexpensive ride ($10 CAD) from the ship to the hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They stored our luggage before and after our stay, gave us a map and some tips. The room was spacious and comfortable. The bed was great! 
The internet was unavailable for a time in the evening. The location was the best. Very close to lots of dining, bike rental and bus stop across the street. The beach is at the end of the road. We would book this again.",2018-08-05T18:28:18Z,61
3015,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"Had the worst 3 night stay. Broken elevators, 1st room over looking a drug user shooting up, power that went out several times in our room, toilets that were clogged. Most of all the staff could care less. Emailed corporate BW and got zero response. Call BW customer service and got lip service. Local management did ZERO to answer concerns and went out of their way to avoid the issues. 

If you want a run down "" lipstick on a pig "" type hotel. Even this place would be worse.",2018-04-14T04:15:32Z,61
3016,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"I stayed here with my family (4 of us) for a weekend. Everyone I encountered was very friendly and helpful. The rooms look like they were remodeled, and it looks very nice. The beds are comfortable, the bathroom is small, and there's a mini fridge in the room. They do have paid parking in their parking garage. It's a little inconvenient since there are all stairs, so carrying suitcases up and down stairs isn't great, but whatever..you can drop them off at the front door if you want. The price for parking is decent, as it is difficult to find hotels in the area with available parking.

Overall, this place is updated, clean, and in a beautiful location for taking walks along the waterfront, and watching the sunsets.",2015-03-09T18:23:31Z,61
3017,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"I was very disappointed in this hotel for the little things. 

The room was very nice and comfortable. Given I stayed during Grey Cup weekend, the $340 for two nights seemed reasonable. 

Until I tried to shower the first morning of my stay. The water did not even get warm, never mind hot. That made for a very grumpy start to the day. After being out all morning, I came back in the afternoon to see if the water was hot now (maybe everyone in the hotel was showering at the same time) but the water still didn't get hot (although a bit warmer than this morning). 

The wifi in the room was extremely frustrating as it was slow and disconnected very often. 

I would not likely stay here again.",2014-12-01T02:20:05Z,61
3018,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"PROS:
- very close to the ocean, lots of shops and restaurants nearby. Good location
- clean
- friendly + helpful front desk.

CONS:
- $9.99/day for parking. Not even kidding you.
- noisy, from both traffic and other guests, probably because it was an old building.
- tiny bathroom. The fan in ours wasn't working.
- you can barely see the television; the tv hutch doors wouldn't open all the way.
- old elevators that made you wonder if they were going to break down during your stay

Instead of your traditional hotel bar + grill or restaurant on the lobby level, they had a sports bar, which weirded me out for reasons I can't articulate. Altogether, I think if we ever go back to Vancouver we'll be looking for a different place to stay. This was perhaps one of the strangest I've ever experienced. If you're looking to save money, you might as well go to a hostel.",2009-06-20T03:38:48Z,61
3019,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"Positives:
Check in early and got a room immediately.
Good size room for two people.
Located at an area where there are a lot places you can go for food, coffee, drink and entertainment. All walking distance to the hotel.
Close to the beach and Stanley Park.
Hotel has a decent restaurant with friendly staff.
Friendly and attentive staff.

Not so positive:
Shower temperature was difficult to keep warm/hot. This may just be affecting the room we stayed in.

Highly recommend this hotel if you happen to visit Vancouver.",2014-08-04T14:01:29Z,61
3020,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"This hotel has a great location and a pretty good deal on price compared to close by hotels. It is an easy walk to many restaurants, grocery and shopping on Davie, Denman and Robson. English Bay Beach and Stanley Park are one block over.

The front desk staff was very friendly. We were even able to check in early. We had requested for a microwave (to warm our baby's milk) on our online reservation (which I didn't ask about when I checked in), but shortly after we got to the room, they brought one up. 

The room was clean, had a flat screen tv and a refrigerator. We also had a nice view! We had a partial ocean view of English Bay.  The bathroom is a little small. I think it wouldn't appear as small if the door swung the other way. 

We had a very pleasant 3 night stay and would definitely stay here again.",2013-09-24T16:09:31Z,61
3021,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"The hotel is great for the convenient location and the friendly staff!
The beds are comfy, and the restaurant was also quite decent. We ate there for dinner and breakfast one day. If you want to go green, ask for a $10 voucher to go towards the restaurant, instead of getting your room cleaned every day.
There is no central AC in the rooms , so it gets stuffy if you don't keep the window unit turned on at night. That is the only part that was uncomfortable. I would recommend staying here if you're in Vancouver.",2017-01-02T02:22:36Z,61
3022,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"My mother and I traveled to Vancouver and stayed at the Best Western Sands.    The room was pretty good and the location was very close to the ocean (which was great) and pretty close to Stanley Park.   

We went to the restaurant located in the hotel a couple of times.    We were greeted with one of the nicest waitresses we had ever had.   She was engaging and informative about places in the vicinity ..   She greeted her customers with the biggest smile.    Her name was Jessy. And her pleasant demeanour deserves a nod in this review ..    

The front desk staff were also very accommodating and did their best to accommodate a skinny pillow request.    

In fact there was only one employee who was not a pleasure to deal with,  one waitress with chip on her shoulder.    But the rest of the staff in the restaurant were so pleasant that it made up for the bad apple in the bunch.

The reason that I rated this hotel with a 3 was due to the shower.    I got alternately scalded and frozen by fluctuating water temperatures.",2015-10-24T02:04:50Z,61
3023,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"I waited to cool off before writing this review. My Grandson and I stayed here on June 6 for one night Thank God. We came over while visiting Seattle and although the room was nice and comfortable it was not a 3 star hotel. Couldn't enjoy my balcony view because bird droppings on seat cushions, railing etc. I was charged $229.99 for my stay and also a surcharge on a money exchange without being informed when I changed a twenty.
Fortunately there is a bank within a block of the Hotel and I exchanged U.S. dollars for Canadian later. The area the hotel is located is filled with what appears to be homeless people and drug addicts. One fellow was sleeping on the sidewalk, and at the McDonalds a block up and across the street, customers had to go to the counter and ask to be buzzed into the bathroom.
My 13 year old Grandson and I agreed it felt urban. Not interested in visiting again.",2016-07-20T13:29:12Z,61
3024,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"Stayed here last week. It was horrible! our room was facing the main road. It was very noisy, it was hard to sleep. We would wake up every time a bus would come and go.
all the windows are tightly shut but it was still very noisy.
in the morning we could not sleep past 8, as there was a construction half a block away and it was very loud! wifi sucked, it was very slow. parking was limited. small parking stalls, surcharge was definitely overpriced. 
Certain channel on tv would make loud cracking noises, the longer to watch the more cracking noise it makes.
house keeping lady was very nice. place was clean everyday.
we checked out at 5 am on sunday and the guy that was there was very rude. didn't say much. no smile. tossed the credit card on the counter after he was done. 
will never recommend this place to anyone nor come back here ever again.",2012-11-02T05:19:42Z,61
3025,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"I thought this place wasn't too shabby at all. For the price we paid we had two full size beds and a sofa bed to go with it. The TV was actually a flat screen and it was pretty cozy.

The place is a stones throw from English Bay. It's a nice walk on a nice day. You probably could run to Stanley Park if you really wanted to. The rooms are nice and big. They are looking after the environment, and they encourage recycling. The elevators are old and slow. Parking is pretty tight. 

The iPod radio they have doesn't charge your phone. It plays music but what good is it if the music drains your iPhone? Want to microwave your food, you'll need to plug that puppy in. 

What's with the bathrooms in Canada? Why are they so small? The last place my GF and I stayed the door hit the toilet and you had to step onto the toilet to get out. While this bathroom was ""bigger"" it was still small. Hell you can't even make love to your love one in there. And the toilet...they are small, like grade school small.

Free wifi, and a nice room, I would come back to this place again. I think it's worth every penny.",2012-02-10T22:05:03Z,61

English Bay where the Sands is beautiful, lots of restaurants and foot traffic in area. Room was super clean and actually was better than the Vancouver Hilton that we stayed at the night before.

3030,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,My wife and I walk out on the back room patio of the bar tonight and what do we see  but the patio table that was stolen from our back yard several months ago.  I have no proof other than we recognize it. When confronted the manager was not receptive. It is after all a lousy 50 dollar table. I don't want it back .  We have spent thousands of dollars there over the last  twenty years. We won't be back.,2014-08-17T07:18:03Z,61
3031,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"I was here on business and leisure. When i called before booking my reservation I wanted to know how their internet was. Of course, any hotel would say they have great internet to get you to stay there but they said it was ""newly installed"" and great so I took their word for it.

So I ended up booking and regret doing so mainly because of the horrible internet. I couldn't work from the hotel whatsoever as the internet were like 90's speeds. Even had them take a look at my connection, didn't help. 

So my overall opinion is that it is a decent nice,clean hotel near Stanley park and downtown which is great, but if you need internet (which I really needed) go somewhere else.

FYI, they give you $10 credit to use at their cafe for every time you decline housekeeping. Also parking is around $17 a night which is kind of on the low end for downtown hotels.",2015-11-29T22:32:30Z,61
3032,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"Won't stay here again! Paid extra for ""partial ocean view"" it was a sliver between high rise buildings or had to step out on a questionable deck to peer around corner to see water. Room wasn't ready on arrival and we checked in AFTER 4pm check in time. Elevators were old and creaky and when stopping dropped a foot to the floor you were exiting on. Carpet in room was wet from being shampooed and smelled of carpet cleaner. Water pressure in shower was jon existent and water temp was Luke warm at best or so scalding hot that you couldn't stand in the spray...there was no happy in between. Lighting in bathroom was dim, closet really tiny. Best thing about the room was the bed was comfortable which is why they get 2 stars and not one. Parking was cramped and there wasn't much of it and we drive a small car...also expensive parking fees $17/night. Lit backs to an alley and street outside hotel us very busy with bus traffic...lots of homeless people on street. Don't reccomend this place at all!",2015-01-03T16:41:29Z,61

When one of my children clogged the toilet because the plumbing is residential grade at best, I called the front desk and was told someone would come soon to plunge it but they did not come until I called a second time. When my wife answered the door the attendant handed my wife the plunger and walked away. The rooms have a small window AC and a only a very small portion of the window that will open, making it poorly ventilated. Considering we could have paid the same amount for a room at the Park Hyatt, I do not see why anyone would stay here other than the close proximity to the Fireworks show in July/Aug.",2014-08-11T01:37:27Z,61

3035,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,I enjoyed this hotel during a recent trip to Canada. It was in a decent part of town with several bar/resturants close by but shopping was highly lacking. I was a little disturbed by how many homeless people were around but I've heard that's pretty common for the area. The hotel was great other than the terrifying elevators that didn't always go down when you told them to. I highly reccomend the hotels breakfast special as well. Huge portions for a great price.,2014-02-10T00:56:07Z,61
3036,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"So we decided to spend out long weekend in BC at the Best Western Plus - Sands and I won'ts tay there again. The service there was actually pretty friendly, but I do NOT like the housekeeping. Two days in a row, we left the Do Not Disturb sign up before leaving for the day and housekeeping still came in. I don't know what their policy is, but EVERY other hotel I've ever stayed at if we keep the sign on the door, that means we don't need housekeeping and they don't enter. The 3rd day we were there I actually got a call and the housekeeper tried to play coy and ask if we had just checked in and when I said no, she asked if I had shades in there. I'm like what? No. She apologized and hung up. Don't try and be sneaky to see if we're still there. Given, I should have just told her right then and there we don't want any housekeeping, but I figured the Do Not Disturb sign was enough. Apparently it wasn't, because sure enough, when we came back, the bed was made and we had fresh towels. AND for being such an enviormentally friendly hotel, they sure seem kind of wasteful. There are the usual cards stating to leave towels on the floor if they need to be taken away and towels hung up means we'll use them again. We've never left any towels on the floor and low and behold, they always switch them out. Some people may think that's a nice gesture, but I'd take more kindly to it if I actually wanted someone to come in.

And to top it off, it wasn't the cleanest room. There were long, blonde hairs on the bed (I am no blonde), there was hair around the drain in the tub and I swear there was a booger on the wall in the shower. The only bonus that I saw to this hotel was the location, free wi-fi and the staff at the counter, but that's just not enough for me to stay again. Sorry Best Western, the Riviera is a divey hotel, but they were much cleaner and when I say Do Not Disturb, they don't.",2011-04-11T06:35:24Z,61

Trees everywhere, it's green, the water is right there, and the mountains give a beautiful backdrop.  Near a busy street, so can be a bit noisy, but not much.  Had a bad view of the parking area, but we were upgraded to the 5th floor, which is their nicest.  Slippers, robes, great amenities, comfortable bed (pillows are a bit stuffy), and very clean.  Classy.  BUT walls are paper-thin, and a room full of young kids with no parental supervision (because the parents were down the hall and not caring) were VERY noisy and it was annoying.

Not bad overall. Good location within walking distance to a lot of good (and inexpensive) ethnic restaurants. The room is a bit too small. The windows are only single paned, I think - at least it feels that way as we can hear noises outside. Still a good value considering how expensive Vancourver can be.",2013-07-01T06:34:42Z,61
3041,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"My partner and I decided to ""play it by ear"" on our recent road trip to Vancouver and the island! WHAT was I thinking? Even though though there were no big scheduled events on the hot, humid weekend that we arrived there was nary a room to be found in town! 

A friend recommended the SANDS Best Western. So as a last resort we walked into the Best Western SANDS to find our guardian angel named ""trainee - Brittany"". Well I think Brittany has customer service down pat! While the other staff were most helpful, courteous and polite I felt that ""trainee - Brittany"" helped these road weary travelers above and beyond her duties! 

As her colleague disembarked on his break just as we arrived at the desk on the late Friday evening, Brittany stepped up, literally and figuratively, to the plate (desk)! I'm sure we looked like raggedy folks, as it was also hot and humid awaiting the ferry, but Brittany took it upon herself to find us a pillow for our weary bodies to lay on no matter what! Not only did she check all the BEST WESTERNS in downtown Van she checked all OTHER hotels (from an overflow list). She did the dialing while still assisting other (patient) patrons. Eventually another colleague arrived to assist the checked in or checking in guests. 

Brittany did not stop until she found as a different hotel (from another chain!). This young lady gets a 10 out 10 but the hotel only got an 8 out of 10 bringing the average to a nine! 

Good choice Best Western SANDS! Keep hiring enthusiastic individuals with good hearts and you'll be our choice for each stay in Van!",2013-07-19T02:03:20Z,61
3042,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"I booked a room on this supposed 3 star hotel. The room I was assigned was about a third the size of a normal room, right behind the elevator shaft. A bed, a desk, a chair, and mini-fridge and TV stand were all crammed into that small space. Moving around the room was difficult. I asked the staff and the manager why was I assigned this room. I would understand it if I had booked the room at the last minute, and that room was all that was left. But I had booked the room two and a half months earlier. They told me that they had put me in that room because I had booked the room from a third party, such as Expedia, Priceline, Booking.com, etc. So the moral of the story is do not book this hotel with an external provider or you'll risk being put up in a walk in closet. Book another hotel. I called Priceline to complain that they put me in a horrible room simply BECAUSE I booked though them. They just told me that the hotel refused to give me a refund, and they sure as hell were not giving me one either, nor putting me up in appropriate accommodations elsewhere in the area.

As for the rest of my review, I will start with the noise. My room was in the back of the building, overlooking the parking lot. That is supposed to be quieter than the busy street in front of the building. The hotel restaurant is a sports bar. That bar has air exhaust duct that goes out in the parking lot. It makes a noise similar to a big, loud air conditioner all the time. The single-pane window does little to block outside noise. The bed was next to the elevator shaft, which meant also hearing the rattling every time the elevator went by.

On my first trip up on the elevator, I noticed that it shook a lot when it came to a stop. I then decided to take the stairs from the fourth floor for the rest of my stay. On my first trip down the stairs, a staff member threw a door open on me. He apologized, and mentioned that someone was trapped in the elevator, and that he was screaming. That elevator was out-of service for the rest of the weekend. The one that backed into my room was still in service.

The remote for the TV had buttons that did not work. I had to arrange for them to replace it.

On the upside, the bed was pretty comfortable, and the room was reasonably clean.

This is not a thee star hotel. I have stayed in motels that are cleaner, quieter, and far more comfortable. I did not pay an outrageously low fee for this hotel. I wonder if it was the hotel staff who decided to downgrade me, or if Priceline booked me in the cheapest possible option, just to maximize its profit. Either way, I'm not booking though either Priceline nor the Best Western Sands ever again.",2014-05-12T03:20:50Z,61

I read the reviews before staying here, and feel it is being treated a bit unfairly on yelp.  The staff is friendly, and we were treated with that ""can do"" attitude.  If you asked for it... they seemed motivated to make it happen.  Both rooms were clean, and had obviously been renovated in the last 5 years.  For an older downtown hotel it has a great location.  Across the street from the beach, next to a magnificent park, and within walking distance of more restaurants than we could had planned on.  It is a bit away from the true hustle of downtown, and the crazy traffic.  They had a safe place for me to park my SUV while away on the cruise.  Their free wi-fil was very fast... and easy to log into.  I would be more inclined to stay here again instead of on Granville.... just because of the very nice beach.

3047,Best Western Plus Sands,3.1,"This is where I have stayed twice while in Vancouver and I won't change that.  All I need is for it to be clean, near the water, have wifi and a hair dryer.  The bus stops are right in front and across the street and you're right at English Bay and a very short walk to Stanley Park.  The price was the main attraction and when you add in a coffee maker and umbrellas, it's absolutely perfect for my needs.  There are a lot of excellent restaurants in the area, my favourites were The Calling and Acacia Fillo Bar, and there are places where you can rent a bike, coffee shops etc. all around.  The only downside really is that the windows don't have screens and the glass doesn't quiet down the noise outside.  I asked for a room overlooking the parking lot/mountain instead of the street for this reason.  Staff was very friendly, the umbrellas were huge and sturdy and even on the day we checked out, they let us use them until we came back to pick up my luggage.",2011-10-23T22:15:50Z,61

Good drinks n pub grub.

3049,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"This was the perfect place to stay for my short trip to Vancouver. Super friendly stuff, convenient location and connected to a fun pub. It's not brand new, but still well kept and clean. More of a dorm style hotel rather than an actual hotel- would stay here again!!",2019-01-30T04:30:00Z,55
3050,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"Over the past 30 years--I've stayed here four times. I'd stay again after this 2018 stay. Clean and inexpensive--you get what you pay for. 

First time, I was age 32, this time age 62.  Both those times I was in a ""single, NO TV, with shower down the hall"".  I knew what I was getting both times with shared facilities and never minded it as I had traveled Europe when I was 23.  Some may be bothered by sharing facilities. I am not. Each single room has a sink...so morning ablutions can be done in 10-15 min. in the shared area. Then Use your room to primp and preen. --robes and slippers are provided to traverse the hallway to shower are in room (I always bring my own).  

 The other two times- I had an en suite  and did not share with others--and had a TV.  As I said--you get what you pay for.

PROS:
-Free (included) local calls--great in-room wifi (included).
-Single bed was very comfortable. 
-Very safe--you have to ring to get in after 11pm.
-I find this hotel VERY well located to bus/subway (I used both)--easy access to YVR airport and Express bus 257 to Horseshoe Bay Ferry to Nanaimo (only a short 2 block walk).

-The staff is wonderful/informative (very patient and helpful with many who are not primary English speakers). I arrived from a cruise at 9am, was so lucky the clerk kept checking to see if my room was ready at that early time--I had my room by 10am. Great Service.

-All shared bathroom/showers were VERY clean (except when mindless clients left their drek behind [shampoo bottles, leftover soap, etc.] not realizing it was a communal shower. Their discourtesy was the WORST for the next person. CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF!

-The breakfast: a minimal continental- I was very happy with the toasted fresh buttered bagel & cream cheese BUT found the coffee very bitter.  Very simple breakfast: OJ, dry cereal and milk. Great for the price.

CONS:
-VERY Poor ventilation in single room--hot, even when cold outside...the mini-fan provided was what saved me.
PARKING: expensive (30CAD/24hr. day, in-out privileges, but difficult to deal with even though next door--self-park--after 11p must get hotel to open gate to park--HUGE HASSLE)...except at Fairmont Waterfront they charge 49CAD/day--take your pick.",2018-06-20T06:22:53Z,55
3051,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"You are getting what you pay for.  

Each floor has a mens or womens restroom.  In there, there are toilets and a shower. 

There is also a shower in the sauna room (but the sauna is broken).

There is also a ""family bathroom"" on the 2nd floor.

Inside your room, you will be a little cramped with a Queen sized (or double twin?) bed, a small desk, and a sink all in the same room.  They do not have air conditioning in the rooms, so you will have to use the fan provided in the closet.  

The breakfast is bagels with cream cheese and orange juice and fruit slices.  

The best part of this place is the location , as it is smack dab in the middle of vancouver, and the value.  The staff is extremely friendly!  The place is moderately clean but not as comfortable as a room to yourself.",2015-10-03T18:07:17Z,55
3052,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"I am so surprised by this place I am beside myself. I am from the states and this sort of hotel is a little uncommon, and to be honest I was a little worried before getting here. The shared bathroom atmosphere is very European and I was traveling alone. But for the price point I loved the Kingston hotel. 

Checked in on Friday evening and the man working the front desk was fabulous. I wish I caught his name because he gave me all the correct information. They give you the wifi, where the closest ATM is, how to walk to the bus, etc. as a tourist in the area this is exactly what I needed. 

This is no 5 star hotel, the room is tiny but the perfect amount of room if it is just yourself and all you intend to do there is sleep. I came in late January and was so hot - the window didn't open so I shut off the heater in my room and found a little fan. I found the bed comfortable and big enough for myself. 

I stayed on the 3 floor and there was a single bathroom / shower outside my room as well as a men's. The women's was just down a small set of stairs. I had no problem having access to the restroom right outside. They provided plenty of towels and robes for decency in the room. 

Breakfast is bagels and sliced fruit. There was also cereal. I was the first up on a Saturday morning and I think took them by surprise. For someone traveling on a budget this was perfect. 

I would stay again as a solo traveler. This is right in the middle of the city and the guest services were fabulous. There is ice on floor 2 and easy to take the stairs as the elevator is slow. There's also a pub next door that I think guests get a discount at! Thanks Kingston!",2017-01-30T15:38:41Z,55
3053,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"Nice hotel at a decent price in downtown Vancouver.  
Very friendly and helpful staff.  Rooms are rather small but clean and neat.  Rooms do not have AC but it wasn't needed for our stay in late August.  Parking is next door and costs $30/night which seemed fairly expensive.  Easy walk to waterfront and plenty of great restaurants and bars. 
This is not a luxury hotel.  But if you are looking for a good place with a good price it fits the bill and I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in town.",2019-08-27T20:57:50Z,55
3054,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"This hotel, while being a little basic in that I had a room with a shard bathroom, was spotlessly clean, very friendly and in really convenient location right in the heart of downtown and a block from the nearest subway.

Sink and water in the rooms, daily maid service.  Clean and well maintained.  Friendly staff.  WiFi. Bar downstairs and lots of nearby food and shopping.  3 blocks to the tube.  Nice little English-style breakfast (Cereal, toast, bagels) made for you by staff with great coffee.  If you want the BIG breakfast, there is a busy diner just across the street.",2020-01-28T20:47:10Z,55
3056,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"As a few others have mentioned, this is not a traditional hotel. However, the location is excellent, it's clean, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. We took full advantage of the sauna - what a nice perk!",2019-04-19T12:25:47Z,55
3057,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"I stayed here in August just before Fall came. This bed & breakfast is a great value for the price. The staff was very friendly and there is even free breakfast in the morning. The breakfast is simple: bagels, orange juice, coffee.... nothing fancy. There is even an elevator to take you to the top floor (floor 3). When you have heavy luggage, it is a nice luxury to see an elevator. 

The accommodations are very clean, good size and overall very decent. However, what makes this place just decent and not extraordinary was the fact that they do not have A/C. During my stay, the weather was HOTTTTT. For the last few weeks of summer during August, I would avoid a hotel without any A/C.",2016-08-21T02:14:40Z,55
3058,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"Rather surprised there are no reviews ahead of me for The Kingston. I discovered The Kingston via browsing through hotel listings on the Priceline.com site, and through much comparison with other sites (Kayak, hotwire, hotels.com, tripadvisor among others), found this would be the best deal for me. It did indeed turn out that way. It's a cute, clean, basic stay (billed as a boutique hotel)--mostly smaller rooms with shared bathrooms, which spells out the price savings, with a few larger rooms with private bathrooms. I did have a small single room; most of the time, the bathroom was available, especially for my late night showers. Otherwise, the next floor bathroom was not too far away. And the shared bathrooms on both floors I used appeared to be cleaned very regularly.

Although I never took advantage of the continental breakfast provided, the breakfast room/lobby area appeared rather welcoming, and I noticed the service in that area to be quite attentive. Service at the lobby/check-in area was very attentive and friendly, and any questions I had were answered in short order.

Good strong wifi that was always available when I needed it--huge plus for me!

The hotel is right next to the Kingston Taphouse & Grill, which I'm guessing is owned by the same management. I could hear some of the classic/80s/90s rock tunes from the taphouse through my window, but the music quit before 10:30 every night of my visit. 

Great location in Yaletown for this establishment, only a few minutes' walk from the Vancouver City Centre SkyTrain and such attractions as the Vancouver Public Library, The Vancouver Art Gallery, and the Granville entertainment district. I would seriously consider coming back to The Kingston should I find myself visiting Vancouver again, hopefully sooner than later.",2011-07-16T04:26:44Z,55
3059,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"This hotel is in a good location but has several issues. The parking for the hotel is in a building next door, which does not allow access to the parking garage 24/7. I found the hotel building had a musty odor to it. The room was very small and had no AC. We also were asked to drop off the key with the front desk every time we left the hotel. The breakfast was VERY limited. It was included in the hotel price but we ended up going elsewhere.",2019-08-06T02:30:17Z,55
3060,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"Staff sucks. I came up to Vancouver for the weekend with five of my friends. Two of us were staying here while the other three stayed elsewhere. Before going out we would meet together and stay in the room. No issues, staying quite. Yet the staff did not allow us hangout in our room during the day. They told us we either had to leave, cancel or reservation, or get two more rooms. I've never heard of that. One of the dumbest policies I've ever dealt with. Plus the room is the equivalent to a carpeted prison cell.",2018-06-22T19:31:02Z,55
3061,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"I just want to give this hotel all the props for what it is. Yes it has construction all around it however it's a hidden gem! We took the shared bathroom and never had to wait. It's so close to all the shopping and nightlife. We payed to park and walked everywhere we could. I could go on and on but it's worth the $$ and a hidden gem. 

All the reviews that have been written are true and accurate. Construction is noisy, fans are great,wifi is strong and worked great, staff is amazingly friendly. I hope this helps.",2015-08-19T04:43:24Z,55
3062,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"Let's start by stating that this is not a traditional full service hotel. Most rooms have shared baths and rooms don't have TVs. It's like an upscale hostel. Once you understand that, you will be very pleased. The rooms are small but clean and there is a small sink in the room. There are robes, disposable slippers, and amenities. The bathrooms are clean and monitored throughout the day. Rarely did I have to wait for a shower and if I did, I just went to another floor. 

The free breakfast is basic but adequate. It is not a buffet - mostly carbs and beverages. If you don't like it, there is a Starbucks and Tim Horton's around the corner. The breakfast room is a sitting room in the evening and you can watch TV. I believe the staff will allow you to bring in take away to eat since there is limited space in your room to eat. There is onsite laundry. Free wifi which is a blessing for international travelers who have limited data plans. 

The location is perfect. Just off a main street but only 3 (maybe 4) blocks to the SkyTrain (metro) so a short and easy ride to/from the airport. Many dining and shopping options in the area. 

The staff is exceptional. Very friendly and helpful. 

I don't know if I've recommend the hotel if you have children unless you book a room with private bath and TV. I've stayed here many times. It's an international budget crowd but guests seem friendly and I've not hear any load partying. 

The only draw back is there is only one plug in the room so if you have multiple devices that need to be charged, buy (or bring) and extension cord. 

FYI, I've stayed here 3 times and it is my go-to place in downtown Vancouver. Don't expect a full service Marriott and level set your expectations and you will enjoy your stay. Vancouver hotels are painfully expensive so this little gem allows you to stay downtown without breaking the bank.",2018-10-26T22:00:06Z,55
3063,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"Extremely bad experience here. Woken in the night to find bed bugs munching on my arms and legs. Killed about three that I could see but not before getting multiple bites. When I reported the problem in the morning, the guy on reception did not seem to be surprised! Apart from the bedbugs, as if that is not bad enough, the rooms are very small and dated. Breakfast is a joke; choice of two cereals only and a bagel.  No fruit, yoghurts or even juice. Would not recommend this hotel at all.",2019-09-23T22:00:22Z,55
3064,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this little place. It is right in the middle of downtown. It has a 1930s charm to it. It is well maintained, the staff is exceptionally helpful and friendly, and it is right in the middle of everything. The minor annoyance of a shared bathroom can be overcome with planning. Staying on a budget, but a budget that allows you to go above hostel living, this place is perfect. It is especially perfect if you are spending your day exploring Vancouver and you need a bed to lay your head and a shower to wash your booty.",2017-04-19T18:30:38Z,55
3065,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"A quaint and pleasant hotel in an older building centrally located in downtown Vancouver BC.  The rooms are small yet comfy, super for a single night or two,  Breakfast is included just off the lobby, and tea and coffee is available all the time.  The hotel pub looks cool and we will partake in a pint before heading out for dinner later.  Its not the Westin Bayshore or the PanPacific, but for the price its awesome!  You cannot beat the price, location, or convenience!",2019-09-23T20:59:02Z,55
3066,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"I've stayed in the kind of shitty motels where drugs and prostitution were the primary commerce related to the places, yet none of those garbage lodging experiences stick in my mind like this one. This hotel is terrible. First of all the service sucks and they generally seem apathetic. If you bring a car, it's literally cheaper to store your car and any local lot than in the one the provide for you (30 dollars over night). The room we stayed in was like an 8 by 10 unit with a shitty full mattress with very visible stains all over it and the sheets. The actual bedding was uncomfortable and shitty as well. This hotel, a hotel with around 80 rooms, has 4 or 5 toilets and 3 showers for the ENTIRE hotel. It's one thing to install things that would preserve water but the sinks they do give you are hardly functional. You have to hold the handle on the faucet to even get water out which means you are supposed to wash your HAND(S) with ONLY ONE HAND. There is literally not a single positive thing I can say about this place. There are 2 ramadas very near by that I have stayed in that are you can go to at a lower cost and they are bigger, nicer rooms, with in suite showers (somehow, something I need to say). If I could choose between staying here again and walking into the ocean (and not walking out), well, I wouldn't choose staying here again. 1 star",2020-03-08T05:03:06Z,55
3067,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"My boyfriend and I were in town for the Women's World Cup final. We booked a room in this hotel months in advance. When I emailed the hotel for confirmation, I received a prompt response.

The hotel was in a great location in downtown. It was a good walking distance to major restaurants, the BC Place, and one of the Skytrain stops. 

It was indeed a budget hotel. We had a small room with a sink and no bathroom. However, 
there were shared bathroom and showers on our floor, which was not a big deal to us. Every morning, we went downstair for breakfast. The host or hostess would serve us toasts and orange slices. We could get coffee, tea, and orange juice there. Guests seemed relaxed and went about their days.

I also like that the wi-fi service was strong and reliable. Awesome!

Customer service was pretty good. Representatives were friendly; they answered our questions and gave some suggestions as to where to visit in the city. When we came back late, there were always someone who opened the door for us.

One downside is that if you stayed in the hotel during the day, you will hear some construction noises next door. There were also construction going on out in the front. Also note that in the evening, there will be people in the patio, hanging out. However the noises die down in the evening.

If I ever come back to Vancouver, I would consider staying at this place again.",2015-07-11T03:44:18Z,55

3069,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"Bang for your buck this is probably going to be your best bet for Downtown Vancouver. 

Booking on Hotels.com allows you to save money on a double occupancy charge. It works out to be $90 for the night. 

I was so sad I didn't bring my fisheye b/c that's the only way you'd be able to capture the single bed room. Also provided is a sink, desk, fan and free wi-fi!

A huge, unexpected bonus was the robe and slippers for each guest. The robe was a nice, comfortable way to move from the room to the shared bathroom to take a shower. I brought flip flops to also wear into the shower just in case.

The shared bathrooms weren't a problem. The shower area is lockable and I rarely came across another guest at all, much less had to wait for them to finish with the bathroom.

Continental breakfast is choice of bagels or sliced bread with butter or cream cheese. The very friendly host/ waitress toasts and serves the bread for you. Jellies are provided. Coffee, tea and fresh squeezed orange juice are provided. 

The breakfast area had a very intimate atmosphere. People sat down, chatted and took their time. Most continental breakfast places seem cold - with people haphazardly knocking over bagels, spilling sugar all over the place and whatnot.

There really wasn't much to complain about, even with construction next door. Construction sites in Vancouver all seem to have someone there to stop traffic. And maybe the room may have felt a bit damp, but certainly didn't smell musty.

If the pricing stays the same among all the other Downtown Vancouver hotels, I would definitely stay here again.",2013-07-15T23:53:22Z,55

Cons: shared bathroom in the hall, small beds, one electrical outlet in the room, no tv or radio, no closet space or space to unpack and the biggest con: the banging, clanging of construction work right outside our widow that starts at 630am!!! The hotel is between two massive condo developments and the noise level is extremely annoying!!!!

Update: DO NOT STAY HERE AS LONG AS CONSTRUCTION TAKING PLACE! I called the desk about the consistent and annoying noise and asked if any other rooms are better. There are none! They further stated that its posted on their website about the construction. It's not on any I checked out to include yelp! Very disappointed.",2013-09-18T14:53:40Z,55
3071,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"The Kingston is a solid option for those on a budget visiting Vancouver. I paid $75/night for a single room, twin bed, with shower and toilet down the hall. Wifi and continental breakfast are included--I didn't have breakfast, but the wifi is rock solid (my portable radio's batteries quit and I played the BBC World Service on my iPad over wifi overnight with no problem). If you want to eat at the restaurant next door then ask at the front desk for a 15% off coupon.

Location is really important: this place is a short walk to Canada Place and the convention center ... 

The construction of a nearby building is expected to continue into the autumn; since noise doesn't bother me this wasn't a problem, but if noise is an issue for you then you might want to wait until later in the year to book here.

I had to attend a seminar at the nearby Hyatt Regency but this place really helped me save on travel expenses for a 4-night stay, and was within easy walking distance of the seminar location.  I booked a room with its own bathroom, which was very clean and spacious.  The room was at the end of the hall and nice and quiet, so I was very pleased with the experience.  The front desk staff were all very courteous.  The only problem was that I had no way to turn off the heat or control the room temperature other than opening the window, which would then let in too much street noise.  The TV appeared to be from a past century but I did not need to worry about using it.  I did not bother with the breakfast as it looked like the same thing most motels serve - cold cereal, store-bought bread.  It's OK because there are places nearby where you can get a hot breakfast if desired.  There's no beating the value for the price I paid.  I would stay there again.",2018-12-19T04:04:35Z,55

Yes, shared bathrooms for most rooms is the norm here, but I appreciate a more communal feel when traveling, even as a mega introvert.   I had to do some laundry as a bottle of medicine exploded in one of our bags and I was having problems with the machine accepting my loonies.

The breakfast was small but perfect. I had no problem sharing a bathroom for the price. You can't beat this hotel for the price. My plane ticket cost more than staying there 3 nights!

Oh, the room are still teeny and you still have to walk down the hall to the shower, but there seems to be a bit more attention to detail and more effort put into customer service. All of the front-desk personnel were more than helpful and pleasant with the questions we had. Love the parking deal with the Westin across the street, very reasonable fee as well as in-and-out privileges. An unpretentious century-old gem. Long may it reign.",2015-01-02T07:03:21Z,55

THE WORST.
I forgot to bring my new jacket (with a tag) and headed to Victoria, 
and then I suddenly thought up that I put my new jacket in the closet.
I called just right away and they insisted they did double check, nothing in there.
I'm pretty sure the maid took it or they were lying.
How can it be disappeared without any touch on that.

Besides,
A lot of noise because of right next to the construction.

It IS charming in an old-fashioned way. Electric outlets are scarce, but there is Wifi. Shared bathrooms down the hall were always empty when I wanted to used them. We had a small room (202) without a TV which was OK with us, kept the price down. (That room can be connected to #203 next door which has TV and private bath). 201 also has private bath, and all 3 rooms face the street with city views. The construction next door is completed now thankfully, with a parking garage where we could park for $30, and a fancy high rise. We found the room clean and bathrooms clean, no complaints. Some of the front desk staff have been there for years, we recognize them from previous trips, very friendly and helpful. One time they loaned us a nice big umbrella!",2017-09-22T22:56:12Z,55

Things to consider, small room, washroom down the hall and shared, but never a wait too long as there are multiple washrooms available. Sink in the room. Room can get a little stuffy, open the window and the construction gets louder. Breakfast is toast, bagels, this time orange slices, coffee, tea, and OJ. 

Perks, centrally located, breakfast/brunch spot called Medina's across the way (looks good, always a line to get in), super friendly and helpful front desk guys, and you can borrow an umbrella from the front desk in this rainy Vancouver weather. A deal for the location!",2014-10-01T17:21:49Z,55

3098,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"I just stayed here for the weekend, and it definitely was what I paid for minus what I expected stateside. For a hotel at the heart of the city, it wasn't terrible but the weather made it horribly humid and uncomfortable for two people spending the night. We had a third person who wanted to relax during the afternoon but we had to go walking to an outdoor location on account of how poor the ventilation was in the room. Wi-fi was free, but owing to the fact that each room only had one outlet (this is ultimately my point and and one was dedicated to the fan they supplied (which I will give them ample credit for having in the first place), I didn't get to test it. It was free though, so can't complain at all.

Starting my review at 5 stars and deducting 1/2 a star for the following: shared single bathrooms, only one outlet per room, broken/drooping/sagging/slightly musty (and overall nasty) mattress, and the attitude of the front desk clerks while checking in and out.

tl;dr Price was great, but don't go during the warmer months and make sure you bring a power strip. I felt safe and slept well, but there was ample reason to take away from a 5 star review. Be prepared for minor inconveniences flying everywhere.",2013-08-13T00:55:15Z,55
3099,The Kingston Hotel Bed & Breakfast,3.8,"This is a very nice European style hotel. What that means is smaller rooms and shared bathrooms.  The room was nice, although no tv or even a clock in the room make it very basic.  They do provide robes and slippers to wear to the bathroom if you wish.
We did not have a problem with the bathroom ever being busy, but we did take our showers at night so not to have any stress in the morning.

I did have a couple of things I wish has been better.  The breakfast was limited. Which for a hotel that is labeled Bed and Breakfast was disappointing Toast and bagels were the only food options.  Drink options were ok including orange juice, coffee, hot chocolate, and tea.  I would have like some protein or dairy  options.
My other wish would have been more information about the restaurants nearby for dinner.  Even just a one page sheet listing half a dozen or so of the more interesting ones nearby would have been very helpful.  In walking around we found many restaurants we would have liked to try if we had known they were here and so close.

It was also pretty close to a station where we could catch the sky train to get downtown. My favorite part of the entire experience though was when we were looking for Asian restaurant recommendations from the very helpful front desk worker who happened to be Chinese. After recommending several Chinese restaurants, she said, ""You should trust the Chinese person!"" with a big crap-eating grin on her face.

It was located about 30 minutes away from downtown.  We couldn't find a hotel less than $100 in the city center so we settled staying here.  They have a lot of Asian shopping malls nearby, fyi.

The hotel room in itself was pretty clean.  The parking lot wasn't very well lit.  

They provided us with only two breakfast tickets even though we had more in our group.  The breakfast wasn't really that impressive or memorable.  I just remember they had cheap pastries and bananas.  It is great for what it is, an affordable place to stay for short visit.",2015-07-26T06:52:39Z,21
3108,Best Western Plus Burnaby Hotel,3.2,"We stayed here in Burnaby because the prices for hotels in Vancouver were too much to justify spending that amount of cash for a place where you'll mostly just be sleeping. 

This hotel is located in the China Town area of the outskirts of Vancouver, which is cool because there are so many Asian restaurants to choose from within walking distance. We had our pick from Korean, Viet, Thai, and Indian food.

Our room was clean, bed was comfortable, and the AC was great (we appreciated this after staying somewhere else with a crappy unit). 

They offer a free breakfast here WITH REAL EGGS!  They served sausage, pancakes, fruit, toast, cereal and coffee as well. You're given vouchers upon check in and need to present them to the staff before eating- we were helped by a guy named Luke, who was the epitome of great customer service.

On our last day, we were also given free $10 gift cards and discount coupons for the nearby Metropolis shopping mall, which we happily used and saved over $25 on our purchase with!

The only complaints I have with this place would be the construction, as people were breaking up pieces of wood at 7:30 AM and a bunch of the limited parking was taken up by construction equipment and old mattresses that were being replaced.",2016-07-31T19:58:26Z,21

I have stayed at several Best Western plus locations over the years and this is a good several steps below those. The location is right on a huge and busy road and the layout is that of a two story motel. The service was friendly and certainly adequate. The breakfast that I have enjoyed at the other locations was not so pleasant here. It is in a space that is a family style Chinese restaurant at night . All the tables are for eight people so you sit all over the place. The food is on card tables and there is a frantic energy with the wars working staff trying to maintain a system that is flawed by design . There is a top tier indoor shopping mall right down the road if that is a plus. For the money and to the previous standards set by this chain , I was underwhelmed.",2019-07-10T22:09:36Z,21

As for the room itself, the hotel appears to be an older building however the interiors are well maintained. Beds were clean and comfy overall very pleased with the room.

The staff helped move me to a second floor room the very next day. They helped me move my luggage as well. That was very helpful.

They are also undergoing major renovations to the front of the building, but no signage as to where to pull into the lobby made me miss the entrance and had to drive around to find it.

In fact, a decent Shanghainese resto right next door that they used to use as their breakfast area at one point, but I'll digress.

No microwave in the room, was told to bring food to the front desk to heat them up. Seriously? Could not find garbage cans in the front of the building to save my life. Not a one. Advertised as a pet friendly hotel but not even a small patch of grass anywhere. None. We had to cross the street to find grass. The whole place feels cramped. Parking is cramped. The Chinese restaurant doubles as the breakfast place in the morning. Weird. Probably would find someplace else to stay next time unless there's some major improvements once the renovation is done.

Then the toilet clogged and when I called the desk they brought me a plunger. I said that is not my job. They did not have staff to deal with it so we had to change rooms. Very inconvenient.

3122,Best Western Plus Burnaby Hotel,3.2,DO NOT make a reservation!  First they do not note online that the least expensive rate is a NON REFUNDABLE rate until they charge your cc and then send you a confirmation. Once you notice and immediately call to cancel they say that they will work it out with their accounting but do not call you back or give you a cancellation number. This location is not truly a good representation of the Best Western chain as they do not abide by Best Western customer service practices and very removed from the Best Western customer service as they do not take care of the customer.  Best Western needs to take their name off this hotel as they do not work with you even as a customer that has booked Best Western because of the quality it should represent. Best Western needs to understand the people do expect a level of customer service associated with their brand.

3123,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"We stayed here April 2024 and most of the hotel renovations had been completed.  We stayed in room 701 facing Howe Street (not the alley) which was at the end of a hall away from the elevators and it was great!  Shof, staff member was very courteous and provided recommendations as we were visiting from California for my birthday.  The King Suite was spacious, clean and updated and I especially appreciated having standup shower with sliding glass doors (instead of a bathtub/shower combo with a curtain).  There was a TV in the living room and another TV in the bedroom.  The happy hour drinks were convenient in the bar.

My only word of warning is that the dozen or so parking spaces were very narrow, but if you let everyone out before pulling in it was fine and the swimming pool was closed for maintenance the week we were there.",2024-04-14T23:14:44Z,67

The two small elevators were located in the centre and my room was very far. And I could hear the aisle walker's voice very well. 

The sink was separated from bathroom and put together with the closet. For busy morning, when more than two people want to use sink or bathroom, that looked very convenient. Also it looked odd because I need to walk to the sink after I used bathroom.

3125,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"The best advice I can offer to anyone looking at this hotel as a central location to easily explore the city (we did) from out of town/country (we were) is this...Vancouver is easily walkable, has excellent public transit and the minimal extra walking will be rewarded in finding little hidden gems. This hotel is gross, with lots of ""renovations"" going on throughout, and located on a very busy street with high levels of noise well into the early morning. It seems to attract a lot of party folk that use the hallways as their personal club at any time of day or night as well. The insulation, or lack there of, between the rooms guarantees you will gain an intimate knowledge of your neighbors whether you choose to or not. The stairs offer quicker transport to the floors than do the ridiculous elevators, but maybe you will be so high from the ""renovation"" fumes you won't mind. The only positive was that when I checked out a day early the front desk host asked no questions why and quickly got me going, I assume they get that request a lot.",2024-03-12T15:46:03Z,67
3126,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"When we first arrived everything was great, front desk was very friendly. We get the keys to our room and then have to go down to their garage and find parking.  Their parking situation is crazy. Their spots are TINY, there's only about 5 spots available and the car next to the spots available are all parked over the lines. It's not worth the price they charge for you to park in there. For you to potentially have to pay for scratches on your car or risking your car getting hit by someone reversing. We get up to our room after finally squeezing into a spot and the room isn't even ready.  We didn't get to the hotel until after 330, so should have been ready. We then get into the room and it stinks from the housekeeper leaving the balcony door open. We go out on the balcony and all we have a view of is the ghetto alley way full of homeless and trash. There was literally a homeless lady taking her clothes off by the trash can and bending over doing weird stretching. I've worked for IHG for over 3 years and he can see my work code when checking me in. So it's sad he put me on that side. We go back down and say we want a different room looking towards the street if possible. They accommodate which was very nice. We get the room, put all the stuff away and then leave. We come back to our room BLAZING HOT. We ask the front desk what's going on with the air conditioner and they say they are switching air units and that it should be fixed in a couple hours. We leave again to go to dinner and come back to our room feeling EVEN WORSE. We were in the room for 5 minutes and were dripping sweat. We call the front desk to come up to our room and they say there's nothing they can do. So we request a fan so we can atleast sleep somewhat comfortable. The window only opens about an inch. So it really doesn't let in any air. Was ridiculous honestly. All of the people down our hall were getting ice and saying they were so hot. They didn't reduce our price or anything. 
Also if you are leaving the same time as us, 530am in the morning. Your car will be chained closed into the lot. The button doesn't work to call them and the phone number left there didn't either. We had to go all the way back up to the desk to get them to open it so we could even get to our car. We were already running behind to get to the airport, so this sucked.",2023-05-07T16:09:13Z,67

We have been travelling and this is by far the worst hotel I've stayed in. Just grateful I'm only here for rwo nights. Stayed in the holiday inn at metrotown and there is no comparison between the two. Definitely won't be staying again, it really ruined my wedding anniversary.

3131,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"We picked this hotel due to its close proximity to The Vogue.  I'm a lazy pants but it was a quick jaunt there and, even close to midnight in below freezing temps, a quick walk back.  

We stayed in room 111. This is the first stop up from the parking area, which I appreciated. 


- location location location. This is a very walkable place. Just walk around within a few blocks and you'll find entertainment, food and a corner store for small items. 
- parking (under $30). Cheaper than comparable hotels. Also on property and below the hotel, which felt a lot more secure (another nearby hotel has an outside parking lot located down the street)
- nice lobby, friendly staff


- loud. I was woken up well after 1am by street noise - folks on the street doing Saturday night things. If (and when, because I guarantee it will happen) an ambulance goes by you will hear it. Loudly. 
- The sliding glass door to the balcony was almost impossible to close. It took both hands and a lot of muscle. I was barely able to. 
- the bed was not the most comfortable, although it was firm rather than the overly soft mattress that most hotels have. 
- of the 4 reading lamps on our headboards, only 1 worked.  Also the apple phone plug on the nightstand didn't charge my phone (although the android plug worked for my husband's)
- the elevator wait times could be long and the elevator was small, although no where near as small as the ""2 people and their suitcase"" size I've seen in reviews.  I'd say it's about a 6 person elevator. Small for a hotel of that size. 

Overall, despite the cons, I found the room was nice and generally clean.  I'd stay here again.",2019-12-02T07:25:13Z,67

We had to either take the stairs or an elevator (there were two elevators and one wasn't working. Also, my closet at home is bigger than this elevator. No joke. Two people with one suitcase each could barely fit) to the second floor then walk across the hotel to another elevator and take it up to the seventh floor. The reason for this is the first elevators don't go up to the 7th floor. Doesn't sound horrible but we had just arrived from a cruise and there were five of us with either two or three bags each. I know I said that everyone was very nice and helpful (which they were) but it was a little odd that we were offered no help getting everything to our room.

Once in our room it was great. We had the family room which was huge! We had a little balcony which faced a side street and as far as I know, no sounds from outside woke anyone up.",2019-07-10T02:44:44Z,67
3133,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"Old building? I get it.
Small elevators? I get it...it's like two people elevator! 

Room? It need better vacuuming work. 
As a frequent traveler, it's not difficult to see when floor isn't vacuumed. It's gross to see clipped nails and other gross stuff

It's really a two stars but kudos for clean towers, nice bed and love the bedding sheets! Great location and friendly check in front desk as well!!

Since this is not a cheap motel price, rooms really need to be clean.  Building is old tired but rooms don't need to be! Look at the great beds and bed liners!! They were so clean, smooth and comfortable!!",2019-07-23T07:23:34Z,67

Got this on hotwire.com for 59$ a night plus tax.

Tried to get an earlier check in before 4pm but was denied.Whoever we spoke to on the phone was not friendly or helpful- i suspect this may of been because we had got the room for almost 50% off ??

The first room i had was really disappointing. 
The decor was really really outdated. I could not figure out how to get to the TV channels and the shower went from freezing, cold to burning my ass. 

In suite water is 3.50 a bottle. I went to the pop machine but discovered it only took change or 5$ bills, so me and my 20$ went back to the room with a  bucket of ice and cracked the water.

About 6 or so teens checked in to the room down from mine and started partying - they were so loud that even with both doors closed it was as if they were right outside.

 I called and asked if i could change rooms and they were helpful and said that it wasn't a problem. They offered to send a bellman up to move my stuff, but i only had a small bag, so i was told i could pick up the new keys when i returned from dinner.

Upon returning, i was informed that i had not been assigned a new room, but it only took a short time before i was given keys to 7th floor executive level.

This room was much nicer and way more roomy with not only the king sized bed but a couch, fridge, robes and seating area. 

Bathroom was small, and the whole  decor was still desperately in need of  an upgrade.

Both myself and my boyfriend tried for over an hour trying to connect to the internet - the front desk clerk transferred our call to tech support, and 2 techs latter was told that it was a problem with the connection going to the entire building and it had been messed up since the day before....... are you serious??

We went for a walk and when we got back it was fixed YEY!!

When we finally went to sleep the bed was sooooo comfy and the rooms black out sheets kept so much light out that i crashed hard until i was awoken by the front desk clerk informing us it was 115 pm and checkout was noon. He was nice enough and we so apprecited the late check out!!

We were also told that i we did chose to stay that we couldn't stay in the same room. We packed up and checked out with ease.

Overall - if you just needed just a place to sleep in a great downtown location - get a deal go for it , but if you want a nice hotel experience, with a cool vibe- look elsewhere",2011-02-27T04:16:58Z,67

Check-in was easy, parking was $26/day which I believe is better than some of the hotels nearby. The room was okay, nothing special but was clean. Free WiFi. The nice thing about this hotel is that it's located very close to pretty much everything downtown. We were able to walk to Gastown (about 25 minutes away) and Yaletown (about 10 minutes away), both of which had plenty of things to do, especially the former. One thing this hotel could work on would be check-out. It was a bit chaotic, disorganized and there wasn't really enough room for all the people waiting.",2018-07-16T02:36:44Z,67

3138,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"Do not book a room on the first floor. 

For starters you have to either take the elevator or walk up the stairs to the second level. You then have to walk a long hallway to a separate elevator that takes you down to the first floor. I have major issues with this floor. 

- It is dark, dingy and the ""separation"" from the rest of the hotel quite frankly makes me feel unsafe to be in this area as a lone woman traveling. 
- The room smelled musty 
- The room was also very dark. The lighting was of no use IF they worked. Two lamps did not work at all. 
- VERY cold in this area and the room itself. There is a heater on the wall, and I eventually got it to a comfortable temperature but seriously it should have been that way before I arrived. Not very welcoming. This is not a Motel 8. Christ, I'm paying over $200 a night.
- The bathtub had two long dark hairs on the wall, as well as a few dark short hairs. I can't STAND hair in the shower. I think it's so gross. I allowed them to come in to clean my room the next day and it still wasn't removed. 
- Shower was weird. I'm only 5'2 and had to bend down to get the top half of me wet. 
- The carpet on the second floor hallway SUCKS when you are trying to pull your luggage. You can't pull it easily AT ALL. Literally resists you. 

The hotel staff were all VERY friendly, the bed was comfortable and the shower pressure and temperature was very good. The restaurant was ok, but did not think the food was worth the price. I didn't try the spa, but wish I had booked a massage. The location was very good. Everything downtown is VERY walkable. Bring an umbrella! 

All in all, it wasn't terrible but the cons outweigh the pros for me and I wouldn't book here again.",2019-04-18T19:25:22Z,67
3139,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"About as mediocre as they come.
The location isn't bad - walking distance from most anything downtown and lots beyond.  But the hotel itself just isn't much.  Our ""executive"" room was tired and amenities are few.  The swimming pool is tiny, not warm, and smells funky.  The elevators are extremely tight, and you may be in for a wait.  The continental breakfast was about as middling as they come - scrambled eggs, stale pastry and not-quite-ripe fruit.  Not many hotel employees in sight, and a clientele consisting mostly of older European couples.  You probably could do worse, but unless you get a really good deal it would be wise to continue your search.",2017-06-15T05:26:19Z,67
3140,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"(More like 3.5 stars) For the price, this hotel is a decent deal for the location. You're smack in the middle of downtown Vancouver, the amenities are okay, the staff is pleasant enough. There are a few things that bothered me, though, and I feel like I can't give a higher star rating because of that.

The elevators were sooo slow, so small (could hold maybe 6 people cozily, and 8 if you crammed them in), and there are only 2 main elevators. Apparently there's another set tucked away behind one of the conference rooms but they were so out of the way that I didn't learn about them until my last day there.

The hotel was at capacity, and though the air conditioning was on full blast in the conference room where about 200 of us were holding a seated seminar, it was blisteringly hot. I had to leave during one point because it was so stuffy.

On that note, the AC in our rooms would not get cool. We had to open a window to get a cooler breeze. 

The bed was not very comfortable. I guess I'm not used to a spring mattress anymore (this could just be my issue after switching my personal mattress to memory foam).

Tiny bathroom.

On the plus side, the water pressure was great, hot water was hot, the windows are actually able to open a few inches instead of being hermetically sealed, we had a fridge, wifi is free with your room reservation (though you have to sign in every 24 hrs), and the downstairs bar/restaurant seemed nice.",2015-05-04T07:20:18Z,67

They finished renovation in the past year or so, the room looked nice to me.  We got their family room, which include a small twin bed on a separate small room connected to the main room.  This small room is kinda bare, they could've made it slightly better with a small night stand and put a real twin bed instead of the roller bed.  House keepers are nice and respond quickly to our request and gave us extra toiletries since we crammed 5 adults in this room :)  Location is good too, plenty of restaurants/bars within walking distance.  Parking is $19 per night inside a gated garage.

Being in a wheelchair, once I got in the bathroom I couldn't even close the door since the door goes in, not out. The problem I had was with the front desk customer service. I was there with another person sharing a room for an event in Vancouver and this was the host hotel. We were told by the event organizer that we would get breakfast coupons for 4 mornings for both of us. But the front desk person said that we weren't eligible since we booked the room through a 3rd party vendor (Hotels.com). Even though the breakfast coupons were paid for by the organizers were were screwed. This wasn't a problem last year since I got the room through the same 3rd party vendor.

3144,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"My husband and I used to love Holiday Inn (even the one located in the notorious SF civic center), and that's why we became the IHG cardholders. But our stay here was a total nightmare! (At least for nightmare, I can get some sleep!)

We stayed in a king bed room which has a connecting door with another room. Regardless the no-more-than-one-person-inside bathroom size and working-in-the-opposite-direction heater, the soundproofing level of the room is ZERO. We can literally hear EVERYTHING from the room next door, like in our own room!!

The party next door checked in pretty late, at least after we went to bed. I was waken up by a scream around 1 AM, which by that time I thought it was from our room. That really creeps me out. Then I came back from my sleep, and figured out that it was from the room that was connected to us. I can sleep if it had been just a vague murmur. But boy, is it vivid. I can hear it just like I can hear my husband's snore, right at my ear, loud and clear. 

They walk, they talk, the use bathroom, they have shower, and they .. well, they have fun. A lot of it, constantly. It's like I was playing inappropriate radio in my own room. 

The screams didn't stop until 2:50am. My husband try to cover them by turning on our TV but it doesn't work. Then I put on my earphones but I can still hear them, loud and clear. 

It was very late and we were exhausted by a whole day's walk so we didn't want to get off the bed (one of the reason is that Vancouver's night is so cold and the heater in the room doesn't work) and pack our stuff to change the room. We thought they would go to sleep eventually and so could we. But it didn't happen. 

Both my husband and I sleep very tight and deep and usually won't wake up during sleep even with frequent sirens, we live in California and you know the feeling. But yes, the sound is just loud enough to wake both of us up immediately and successfully kept us from falling asleep again.  

We believe they are not doing this intentionally because nobody would expect a hotel room with absolutely ZERO soundproofing. So after failing to let them hear us vocally, my husband knocked the door gently for once to let them realize the awkward situation out of courtesy. They then lower the voice but we can still hear EVERYTHING. It haunted us all night long until they leave the room in the morning. And we had to cancel our visit plan in that morning because we barely slept.

Thank god we are grownups. If there was a kid in our room, I'm sure someone will be sued.",2015-10-20T00:02:27Z,67

As I was telling her that I understood, she completely cut me off mid conversation & stated that she was ""very busy and didn't have time for this"" & hung up on me........... as an employee of IHG I felt that this was extremely unnaceptable & does not meet the brand standards in any way.

If you're walking like I was, AVOID THAT END OF GRANVILLE! Streets smell of piss and there are homeless people everywhere. Howe, however, is nice, clean, and quiet. 
The lobby is pretty and the staff was friendly enough. The two elevators are TINY and painfully slow. Seriously, 2 people plus luggage filled them up, but people tried their best to cram on anyways. When attempting to leave the next morning, we waited 20 minutes on the 4th floor where our room was to catch an elevator. Any time one of them opened, they were full to the brim with people and luggage all trying to go downstairs. After waiting too long, we tried to take the stairs... turns out, there's no lobby access from the stairs, and the 2nd floor door was locked, so we had to trek back upstairs to the 3rd floor. Again, we were met with a wait for the lifts. Eventually we got downstairs, but this was the case every.single.morning. 
Now for the room: it was comfortable. The beds were great and I slept like the dead. Maybe that's because I walked 10 miles a day, but either way, no complaints about being able to sleep. I did appreciate that there were phone chargers connected to the phone/alarm clock (I forgot my charger at home all the way back in Texas), but... they didn't work. I didn't realize until I woke up the next morning to see that overnight my phone had only gone up 2% charge. Not cool. The other outlets in the room (accept the one in between the bedside lamps) didn't work either. The bathroom is TINY. I'm only five feet tall, but I couldn't even close the door if I was sitting on the toilet. The floors also get super slippery if you forget to put a towel down on the floor after a shower. Always remember this, or you may bust your head open. The view from my room on the 4th floor was ok... if you didn't look down. If you looked down, you were greeted with black, grungy rooftops and alleyways. If you look at eye level or upward, the skyscrapers are quite nice. 
Now for the Wifi. We had our room for 5 days and 4 nights. We were told upon check in that the Wifi that came with the room expired after 3 days... so it wasn't even good for the entire stay. Not only that, but it was GARBAGE. Half the time it didn't even work. Luckily, most of my time in Canada wasn't spent in my hotel room.

For last minute hotel i was satisfied, not perfect but 
accommodating for last minute decision. 
Beds are Ok, I'm spoiled with my Sleep Number and custom pillows that it is very hard to please me with any bed and pillows :) 
Went to closest liquor shop to get some local wines to relax.

3154,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"My wife and I were visiting Vancouver for the weekend with some friends. Reason for staying at the Holiday Inn is that I am a member of their IHG rewards club and had a free anniversary night and points to use for a free stay. The Holiday Inn at 1110 Howe is the only IHG brand in downtown Vancouver.

Location is very close to Granville Island and Yaletown. We visited both places during our stay. There are lots of restaurants, bakeries, shops and convenience stores within walking distance. We stayed in the executive room 732 at the South end of the 7th floor. The hotel provides free wi-fi which is nice but it did not work well at all in our room. It kept cutting out throughout our stay. Our toilet also had an issue of running. You had to watch where you positioned the handle for it to stay quiet. Lastly is the showerhead. I am around 5'8 and had very little space underneath the top of it in our room. If you are over 5'10 then you will probably have to bend down for your head.

My wife and I both slept fine in their king bed. The room also had a complimentary umbrella to use during our stay which was convenient. Front desk was pleasent upon check-in. The elevator to the rooms is quite small. No free breakfast buffet but there is a bakery nearby that is open 24 hours (Breka).

If you are an IHG member and have a free night and/or points this place is convenient if you want to be in downtown Vancouver and walk around. This is not a hotel that I would personally pay full price to stay at. Our friends stayed at the Residence Inn two blocks away and it was rather nice in comparison (free breakfast, kitchenette, happy hour, wifi that didn't cut out, higher showerheads as a few differences).

3155,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"This hotel is worse than most holiday inns. It has not been upgraded or renovated. The rooms smell as vintage as the 1970s furniture. The shower temperature is inconsistant and the irony of having to run the water for 20 minutes to get a warm shower while reading the ""safe our animals/conserve water and reuse your towels"" signs in slightly ironic.  the shower has no pressure and changes temperature. But that really is the least of your concerns. From the 7th floor you can open your window to a lovely view of the sex shop on Robson st. very inviting. 

The internet does not work and the elevator is loud enough you can hear it run all night even from 6 rooms away. There is a meth clinic just down the street.  And to top it all off I found a hair ... not mine in the linens.

Some of the older reviews may have been before the renovations. It has been remodeled wonderfully - new carpet, nice bedding, new furnishings. Overall felt amazingly like home just as a hotel should.

Tanner is the best manager we have ever dealt with.  Kind, understanding,  pleasant. He made the hotel stay even better. 

The hotel location is perfect - downtown close to shopping, Granville and Davie street. Walking distance of almost everything. 

My favorite thing at the hotel? The spacious 2nd floor outdoor patio which is the best place to grab a bite or have a coffee and read the paper in the morning! We stay here often and will continue to do so. Highly recommend!!!

-The bathroom was small. Not a big deal, but if you're looking for luxury, you need to look elsewhere.
-Parking was expensive (but it's like that everywhere downtown), and the spaces were tiny and difficult to park in. Oh, well. We managed.
Pros:
-The neighborhood: right downtown. Close to all sorts of area attractions, restaurants, businesses. You honestly could get a cab here and make this your home base for a walkable stay in the city.

The hotel room was okay.   The walls are a little bit thin so if your a light sleeper than you might not want to stay here!!! For us we just use the room to stay in at night but other than that we were exploring so we hardly use the room.

If u want cheap or convenient then stay here!   If you want ambiance, niceness, and fine living then go somewhere else! 

Side note: in the vancouver 2010 olympics most of the referee stayed at this hotel! A  nice fact that the souvenir stand guy told us :D

I had a couple free nights form InterContinental Group sitting in my account that I originally wanted to use at a nice property in Europe, however plans changed and it meant either they expire or I use them here in Vancouver. Since I have renovation at home and the HI is not far I thought why not giving it a shot. Oh dear... let me say: Had I have reserved this room and paid actual money for it then I would have just canceled the reservation and moved somewhere else. I got one of the Executive Rooms on the 7th floor. If THESE are the Executive Rooms I honestly do not dare thinking about how the Standard Room's look like. The hotel is urgent need of a complete renovation. The Internet loses connectivity every 20 Minutes, the cordless telephone is absolute trash and the manual a/c behind the sofa sounds like an airplane engine.

Parking is 20$ a day which I got comped because of my Platinum membership which was nice of them. I would have parked at home though otherwise.

I have no problems staying at a Holiday Inn and do so a couple times a year. This one is borderline to unacceptable considering the rates that are being charged for it. Anything beyond 59$ would be a total waste of time and money. For me it served the purpose of a storage and bed for a few hours sleep during my paint works at home but as a tourist or on Business Travel I would gone bonkers at this place!

3162,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"A friend and I stayed there for a Friday night so we could break up the trip from Victoria to Seattle. On my reservation, and during check in, I requested a quiet room. Now, I've stayed in many, many, many hotels along the way, so I realize the hotel can't completely control how quiet the experience will be. So, some of this the could have and some was just bad luck, but here's all the frustrations:
1. The room was on the Howe street side of the hotel, and the vehicle traffic was noisy. The windows aren't good for buffering outside noise.
2. The people in the room next door were partying into the night.
3. The people on the other side woke early and had a young kid. The kid and adults were making way too much noise for 7am on a Saturday. We had an adjoining door with this room.
4. The cleaning staff was very loud starting at 8am. I've never heard a louder crew.

My friend and I planned to sleep in, but instead were awake and frustrated as we started our day.

On the bright side, the front desk staff were pleasant during check-in and check-out. The lobby decor is nice.",2012-10-20T18:29:03Z,67
3163,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"Stayed here with two friends over this Memorial Day weekend for a girls' weekend in Vancouver. The hotel itself isn't terrible... nothing fancy, but still clean and comfortable to sleep in.  It gets a low rating because of the staff we encountered on our stay.

First, showed up at noon and, fair enough, our room wasn't ready yet. They made it very clear that ""guaranteed"" check-in wasn't until 4, but we were able to leave our bags and park in the lot so we could go grab some lunch while we waited.

Returned around 2:30. Room still not ready, and saw that was the case with multiple other parties who were trying to check in. So we left AGAIN.

Came back at 4.  Seems like they didn't let anyone check in before 4, because there was a line to the door at the check-in desks.

When we went to check in, the guy at the check-in desk reviewed our reservation. ""Oh, it says your reservation is only for 2 people. The third person will be an extra $10 a night."" Fine. ""Looks like you requested a room with 2 queen beds. If you want, we can give you 2 double beds instead and we won't charge for the extra person."" No, we'll take the queen beds... We'd already paid that price online. An extra $20 isn't a big deal. ""Ok, we'll get you 2 queen beds.""

The main elevators in the lobby barely fit 3 people in them.  When everyone is checking in at once, it meant we basically had to stand in line to take the elevator, because the six people all waiting to head upstairs couldn't all fit.  After waiting in line for 20+ minutes to check in, we were not amused.

Get up to our room.  Tiny, 2 double beds.  SERIOUSLY? We call down to the front desk to explain our predicament to the girl who answered.  She said she would have the guy call us back in a couple minutes.

Twenty minutes later, he calls back, and basically blames us, saying he explained that the queen beds would be an extra fee.  Right, but we said that'd be fine.  We were not impressed that he took no accountability for screwing that up.  Another twenty minutes, and we were able to go get keys for a new room, with 2 queen beds.  To be fair, it looked like they ended up not charging us the extra $10/night.

The concierge was really unhelpful (well, the first one we dealt with).  Asked for restaurant suggestions, and he just pointed us in the general direction of a couple different streets where there were lots of restaurant options.  Being indecisive and not wanting to wander the streets finding something to eat, we asked for specific recommendations he had of places he might enjoy.  Again, he just pointed us to a couple different areas that would offer lots of options.  It was very clear he didn't want to be bothered with our questions.  Isn't that his entire job description?

PROS: The hotel itself is just a few blocks from Robson St, a main shopping street with tons of clothing stores and restaurants, as well as a couple blocks from the river, where you can catch a water taxi to Granville Island, which was pretty cool.

Overall, it wasn't a bad stay, but I wouldn't stay here again.  The rude staff left a poor taste in all of our mouths.  Before this stay, I'd always held Holiday Inn in high regard, as every experience with Holiday Inn prior to this had been extremely good.  Seems like with this particular location, though, you get what you pay for.",2013-05-28T01:24:56Z,67
3164,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"Boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights on our recent vacation. We decided to stay at the Holiday Inn because it seemed like the cheapest possibility within the city. 

We were welcome by a very friendly and sociable front desk agent and asked him if he could give us a deal on room rates. He lowered it from $130 to $100 a night for two nights, which was nice of him. We also chose Holiday Inn because they offered parking in a secure garage for $20 per day. He was nice and gave us a map of the city and offered suggestions for things to do during our stay.

The room was clean, decent sized, they offer both soft and firm pillows which is really nice because usually I think hotel pillows are way too soft, and super nice smelling shampoos, conditioners, and body lotion. It was coconut lime flavored, and MMM it was good! I even wrote the cleaners a note asking for extra lotions to take home with me because I'm pretty obsessed with the smell.

There was free wi-fi offered, but we had really bad service from our room and couldn't really use it. I think we were too far away from the box, and it was quite inconvenient. Boyfriend and I wound up having to sit on the floor behind our door to get kind of internet... but it still was very slow and most of the time the pages wouldn't load.

Overall, it's no Four Seasons (not that I've ever stayed at a Four Seasons) but it did it's job and the price was okay considering it was in the middle of downtown. The service was good and the beds were comfortable.",2011-03-27T20:20:42Z,67
3165,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"We checked in and realized the room we booked was a little small for 5 of us (2 kids, 2 parents & a grandparent).  The MOD, Tanner, went out of his way to make sure we had a room more fitting!  For it's location, I feel it was a great value.  The concierge was SO helpful in informing us about taking the hop on/hop off bus to see the attractions.  I also loved that kids ate free, that was a big bonus too:)  If you're not looking for super fancy and just want a good location and a good value, this is a great choice!",2016-10-14T15:06:37Z,67
3166,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"I don't think this Holiday Inn is as bad as every one else is making it out to be. I got a pretty good rate to stay here after a cruise and though the Howe Street location isn't that scenic, it will do just fine in a pinch.

My son and I didn't look forward to lugging all our stuff up from the docks in a heavy drizzle, but once we got to the hotel, our room was up high enough to be quiet and had a great view of the enclosed swimming pool across the street that nobody used. Coming from southern California, I was SHOCKED to see a pool like that!

Normally I also associate Holiday Inn with a sunny, genial appearance but Howe Street is a little heavy and lumbersome. It was as gray and taciturn as the weather, but it also had a free shuttle that took us to the airport so I am grateful for that.

Students on a budget?  Travelers not so fussy that they need every little thing perfect?  Those who wish to be right across the street from a booming Starbucks are in luck with this Holiday Inn. I say: A-OK.",2010-02-15T15:57:05Z,67
3167,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"My boyfriend and I had a very enjoyable stay here during October. 

Pros- The hotel is located walking distance to many restaurants and shops. The staff is exceptionally nice, especially in the bar/restaurant area. My boyfriend made friends with one of the bartenders (regretfully, I can't recall his name), but he gave us two awesome restaurant recommendations and even loaned us his personal umbrella. Really, top notch people in every area of hotel.

Cons- The location is a little rundown/scary to walk around in at night. I am a city girl, so I toughed it out, but admittedly, it was a bit dodgy. The rooms are a bit old and no frills, but not bad either. They were clean and nice enough. Oddly, the hotel does not have a pay-per-view service. It would have been nice to watch a movie on our early nights, instead of being hooked on a Storage Wars marathon!

I would definitely stay here again. It's in a prime downtown location for a reasonable price. The staff really made the stay enjoyable.",2012-11-19T07:17:01Z,67
3168,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"This is a great/handy location... walkable to downtown restaurants and bars and plenty of places to get a good massage locally if you need one (there is a place right across the street that we used that was particularly good (West Coast Forest Spa).

The staff were supremely helpful... the bed was comfy and (for a city) the rooms were not too noisy.

Overall, very happy and would stay again.",2014-02-20T19:13:33Z,67
3169,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,I wish there is zero star or negative star. Soundproofing of the rooms are extremely bad. Their cleaning staffs are also very rude.,2015-01-04T18:44:06Z,67
3170,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"3.5/5 fair value for what it is.

first, this is a bargain chain. you're not getting a luxury suite, and you know that. so given, i thought this was a great deal for my family on our recent trip between the holidays. for a week's stay we paid under $100 per night during what would be a busy time of year in a very convenient location - we were always just steps away from public transportation.

the general lobby was clean and well-lit, and for the most part the staff were very helpful. the room itself could definitely use some work, but for our purposes it was really just to reset for each day, so that was fine with me. there's a bean-shaped pool downstairs that is pretty much 90% deep-end, so while not large was good enough to get good treading workouts in every day (there's also a mini-gym with the usual equipment).

the only real issue during the stay was that we could hear a bit of commotion from our neighbors - but can't fault the hotel for that. at least once we heard them advising one of noisy rooms that if they didn't settle down they'd be asked to leave, so again the staff are trying to make this the best experience for all.

i'd consider booking again!",2015-01-18T02:59:13Z,67
3171,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"If zero stars was an option... 

My family HAD a reservation here and we were met with nothing but hostility and very non-accommodating service at the front check-in desk by Elizabeth (Liz) and her on duty manager as well. After a 6 hr drive we planned to meet our father here for check-in and have a nice family dinner and stay for 3 nights. IT NEVER HAPPENED. On August 27, 2015 we arrived around 4p to check-in and found out that my father booked a room for all of us under his company account. He missed his plane and could not get on another flight soon enough. (Liz) looked at me like I was a criminal trying to get over on her or something but my brother and I just wanted to wash up, rest, and grab a bite while waiting for the Calvary (the rest of the family). Instead we were not allowed to check-in without my fathers company badge id and were told we could wait in the lobby or outside. I could park my car in the garage and pay an extra 27 dollars, but I can't check-in, wash up, and rest after a 6hr drive? Go sit for 3 more hrs and wait until my fathers plane lands (which I didn't know if he was coming sooner or later)? We had ID and confirmation reservation and all... Nope, they forced us extremely exhausted guests to sit and wait without knowing where we were going to stay. Horrible service and did not accommodate us. Rather the front desk glared at us thru the window, spoke quietly about us, snickering about. Do not stay here... There are plenty of hotels with human beings providing fabulous accommodations, so our father booked us a room at the Westin Bayshore which was way cheaper and a much better hotel for 1/3 the price of Holiday inn? If you don't like your job it may be time to retire or move on. I am a retail sales manager and they dropped the hospitality ball big time. If you don't want to honor reservations or corporate discounts then don't offer please. Worst experience of my life. I felt singled out cause I'm younger or felt I was being treated like a criminal. It was inhumane to just brush us to the side until we somehow get the hard copy of my dads work ID. Totally lame, never again holiday inn... What a waste of time and energy 

The Westin gave us a free harbor room view upgrade and even gave us free breakfast vouchers for the holiday inn débâcle. Now that's humanity and hospitality - do better and don't accept what holiday inn has to offer. Classless service, non-existent hospitality, and inhumane treatment? No thank you!",2015-08-28T13:55:42Z,67
3172,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"We all know the adage ""you get what you pay for.""  In this case it's right as rain :(  My rating is actually 2.5... the Inn is easy to find, has food and drink, comfy bar and good location.   Usually, my first impression of a hotel is the check in... mine was not good, the woman at the desk was not friendly, didn't give eye contact once, was very curt... YUCK! 

This hotel is not user friendly, we were on the second floor which should be easy enough, but alas, it was not to be.  Without any direction from the ""friendly"" check in ""girl"", we got in the elevator and went to the second floor, when the doors opened, we were alone on a floor that only had conference rooms.  I was so tired from the 4 hour drive from Seattle that I didn't pay attention that the back door opened... arrrgghhhh.  I went back to the lobby and asked where my room was... I was told it was on the second floor but I would have to walk straight, make a left, then a right, go down 6 stairs, make a left and my room was on the right.  Oh yeah, that's how it was... we were dragging luggage behind us as well, so we had to bounce them down the stairs.  When we entered the room I was happy to see it was a fairly large.  As I plopped down on the bed I was again pleased at the comfort of the bed and the pillow menu (removable straps on the pillows with sayings ""soft"", ""firm"", etc.)  Just then, I was buzzed in the face by a flying creature... it was a gnat... there were a couple of them but I could live with that, it was only for one night.  The bathroom was small and had dirty grout on the floor. 

On second thought, while remembering the dirty bathroom floor, my 2 star rating is justified.  I would not stay here again.  Vancouver is huge and there are plenty of hotels to choose from.",2008-08-26T19:04:45Z,67

3174,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"We stayed here three nights on our trip to Vancouver.

The place is alright. We didn't have any trouble with the staff. In fact, I thought they were great. Since we were parking our rental car there every night they gave us a pass to put on the dash. Well, the first night we left it on the car seat instead of the dashboard and sure enough there was an $80 ticket from IMPark on the the window. We took it to the front desk and they voided it. Thanks for that!

The neighborhood isnt that great except for the starbucks across the street. Originally we'd planed to stay at the one in City Centre which, if you want to walk around at night, might be a better choice. It is weird having the peep show place across the sleep. In most cities thats a bad sign. Maybe its different in Canada.

But the Howe st hotel is close to Granville Island and Robson street if that's what you're looking for.

The room was fine, no frills, none expected. And you can see right into everyone's room in the building across the street, There was a guy making dinner in his underwear which was funny. That also means they can see you, d'oh!

The internet connection is pretty bad. We had to reconnect every few minutes. Sometimes it'd take 5-10 minutes to reconnect. At least its free, unlike The Empress.

The only reason I wouldn't stay here again is I'd rather stay somewhere out of downtown next time, maybe North Vancouver or the City Centre.

Other then that, the place was fine.

The parking garage is pretty ridiculous and maze like. Just make sure you put your parking pass on the dash!",2013-10-15T18:58:22Z,67

I had friends visiting Vancouver and we stayed here for the weekend.  It's proximity to many things downtown made it very convenient to tour the city, Reena-style.  The lobby looks quite nice and modern.  We didn't take advantage of the spa or pool.  The rooms were a combination of modern and outdated. The decor was all modern as it seems they updated the furnishings in the last few years.  The bathrooms were not that modern though - just run of the mill.  Our biggest complaint though, was the central heating system.  It was so hot in our room with the sunny days we had that weekend and if we tried to turn the fan on to blow cool air, it would blow hot air instead.

Came up from the USA to stay a weekend in Vancouver and upon arrival at the hotel they told us they didn't have our reservation. I showed them my booking confirmation and the ID number. The attendant then went to get the manager and the manager told us that they no longer do business with the website we booked the room on. I asked how that was possible because I checked out and paid for it, and got a confirmation number. She said there was nothing she could do because they don't do business with the website any longer. She suggested that I call the website to work it out. She didn't say sorry, she didn't offer to call the website on our behalf, she didn't offer us a new room at the same rate we paid for already, nothing. So we are in another country with no cell data and no where to sleep. Then she tells us that we can book a room at the hotel but it will be next to the bar and loud. Again, not once did they ever offer to get us the room and price we booked as a courtesy because we got screwed over by this website. It's such bad customer service on their end and I'm appalled at the way it was handled. This website is using their hotel to take money from innocent people and the hotel could clearly care less. After 10 minutes of frustration the manager suddenly said she had a cancellation room that wasn't by the bar that we could purchase.. yeah, sure. So I paid double for a room at this hotel.

No fridge nor microwave but a clean bed/beds, table/desk, sliding door that opens, A/C, decent bathroom, and coffee maker/iron/hot pot.  What took away from the experience was the horrible internet connection, piss poor TV reception, and lack of a free or discounted breakfast.  Both the internet and tv would get very spotty service.  Their internet stations were pay to use $3 for 15 minutes.  Their pool was pretty cold and really could've used a hot tub.  But the location was great.

3180,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"A note of caution if you stay here: certain rooms are very noisy!! We were in town to run a half marathon (which we mentioned upon check-in) and were put in a room that was directly next door to a club. The music was so loud that I went down to the front desk around 12:30am to ask for ear plugs. The nice gentleman at the front desk asked which room I was in. As soon as I told him he knew that the noise was due to the club next door. He shook his head and asked ""didn't they warn you when you checked in?"", which they did not! So we ended up getting about 2 and a half hours of sleep the night before our half marathon, which made for a pretty miserable experience. When I complained to the manager the next day they moved our room which was helpful for the rest of the trip, but didn't help us get a good night's rest for our race. This really disappointed me, because everything else was fine. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean.

I asked if there were any discounts we could get being a Holiday Inn Member, AAA, or senior, and the staff member explained they already booked all of those rooms. The conversation continued to be ever more confusing. As I was talking to her, she then told me that the room I was in the process of booking had been booked online and therefore there was no room at all for me! After hearing this I asked to talk to the manager, Farsa? He was even more rude and not helpful in the least. We ended up staying at the Marriot and it was amazing all around!

I asked at the front desk for extra shampoo because Holiday Inn always has a card in the room to let them know if you need anything. ..they didn't have any extra shampoo.   We picked out  this hotel because of the indoor pool. That was a big part for the birthday girl. Well, the pool does not  really have handicap accessability. You have to go on the slippery marble floor  thru the restaurant/bar. Well, needless to say..we did not want to travel thru the diners in our sandals carrying towels, so we did NOT use the pool.

3189,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Vancouver Downtown,2.7,"I am not the kind of person that likes to write bad reviews but I felt this one had to be said. Me and my girlfriend live in the San Juan islands just south of BC. We were planning a much needed trip, also our first together. Even as we got there the room was nothing special. There was wallpaper pealing off the walls, and it was much smaller than the pictures showed and the employees all seemed very much like they didn't want to be there.But what really sent us over the edge was on our first night we decided to eat at the hotel restaurant and I had a sheperds pie and my girlfriend got the hunters chicken. Four hours later she was throwing up with was obviously a case of food poisoning. She had no flu symptoms or anything throughout the day and we had eaten the exact same thing that day up until that point. As it was late at night the next morning we called down to the front desk to tell them what had happened. They said they would call us at a certain time and never did. The next day was spent playing phone tag with management. When we finally got a hold of someone we went to meet the manager and restaurant manager. This was a horrible experience. Both of us are very calm and reasonable people. We were treated with a horrible passive aggressive attitude and they actually started talking as though it was our fault. ""Maybe she had a 24 hour flu"" ""everyone's stomachs are different"", ""it's not food poisoning because you didn't go to the hospital."" And amazingly ""usually these things happen in groups"" so not only are they terrible managers, but apparently they are willing to wait for this to happen again. And they paid for our parking, a small fee compared to the hundreds we spent for the stay. Amazingly they offered a free meal at the restaurant that caused the issue. We began talking them with only the intention of informing them but after being treated like crap I believe they should have refunded our stay. The only good thing about our stay was the in house massage therapist who we both got a massage from her and she was great. Also one very nice house keeper named Evelyn. Both should at least get a huge raise for having to work here. All in all I would not waste your money staying at this place.",2014-05-05T19:30:48Z,67
3190,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites North Vancouver,3.4,"I'd like to preface this by saying I'm from Washington State, USA. We stayed in this hotel since we had some extra points and I hadn't been to Canada before. The room was good and it was pretty quiet. Only issue I had were the following: the 2nd toilet paper roll had a dark black spot on it, there's no water fountains that I could see. Bathrooms downstairs were closed, the water provided downstairs ($1.50 ea.) were disgusting - again, I'm from WA state, so our water is delicious and I'm kind of a snob when it comes to water. 

When we called front desk we were told we would need to come downstairs for anything since they only had 1 staff working.",2023-12-10T21:16:28Z,37
3191,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites North Vancouver,3.4,"I have stayed here several times over the years, (was) wonderful staycation, as well as have directed visiting family to this hotel, but it has slowly declined to the point where I feel I must say something.

I booked a room for a visiting friend, for one night. At check-in I asked if the hot tub was working. Reason being, we had inquired last summer about the hotel and the hot tub was down, just wanted to ensure things were back in order. I was advised at the front desk it was still down but ""Maintenance is working on it""

Photos attached of the wooden deck covering the long defunct hot tub. Also attached current photos from the IHG website showing the hot tub when you are booking the room. To be fair, they do not mention the hot tub in their list of  amenities... but why are the photos still there?

So when my friend started to settle into his fresh clean room... he discovered a child's mitten on the floor - in plain site. Not sure what to think of that. Next morning he took my son for a swim and then figured they'd try the sauna. Nope... that wasn't working either.

I met them for brunch at Medley's, their in-house restaurant. My son had a few sips of his Coke, then claims to see a FINGERNAIL in his drink. Well, you know kids right? Well... there was in fact a FULL NAIL CLIPPING in his pop. EWWWW!!!. The server reacted appropriately and alerted the restaurant manager? The pop was replaced, the manager came over and lightly discussed the matter expressing he had NO idea how a fingernail could have gotten in the drink.... We finished our medicore meal, pretty much what I expected. When we finally got the bill (sloooowww) , the server proudly exclaimed they took 15% off the bill... Seriously??? That was like $6 off for a fingernail in the pop...

Ya know... had the manager reacted differently and gone over the top to try and rectify the situation I'd happily be writing a different review of how the staff went overboard to address the situation and how it shows they truly care about the customer. Seriously it was a $70 bill... what's good stewardship worth in the long run??  Well.... maybe they'll learn.

So sad to see this place go so far downhill... guess I'll redirect out of town visitors to Lower Lonsdale to the Pinnacle or somewhere else nearby.",2023-03-02T20:26:26Z,37
3192,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites North Vancouver,3.4,"It pains me to write this review, as I am an avid IHG user. This was my first time to Vancouver and choose this location due to it being just outside of the downtown Vancouver area.

The check in/check out staff were fantastic and even gave me some ideas on activities to do while in Vancouver.

The hotel is defiantly dated and could use a facelift. The reception lobby area is nice, but the rooms are very dated. I was located in room 330. The room itself had a strange odor to it. It smelled like a room that was once a smoking room, and the smell of smoke has just seeped into the walls and floor, leaving a strange, musty odor. This, in all honesty didn't bother me too much.

What did bother me.....is bedbugs. Yes. You read that right. Bed Bugs. The morning that I checked out, I found a bed beg on the comforter of the bed. Upon check out, I notified the front desk personnel and she profusely apologized. I have a picture of the bed bug and showed it to her. The General Manager was not in yet and she gave me her card to send an email, which I did. 

I requested for the total amount of the room to be refunded. The GM stated they had someone come and check for an infestation of bed bugs, and she stated thier investigation found no evidence of bed bugs....even though I have a picture on my phone that proves otherwise. The only compensation I was offered was 5000 points added to my IHG account. Definitely a huge disappointment. Will not stay again. 10/10 do not recommend.",2023-01-28T00:22:16Z,37

Our keys demagnetized multiple  times. I bring it up to the manager, and she tells me I'm  lying it only happened  once. Absolutely  untrue, pull the video and see my family inconvenienced over and over again. I don't care what your computer shows, it's a failure  remember,  It's not reliable  in the first place.

I booked this place because it looked like a medieval palace, but when I checked into my room, it also looked like a castle room from the last century. The inside is old and dingy. The rooms are decorated in the 1990s style and have not seen any upgrades. The bathtubs are small and the lighting is dim. The toilet is tiny. The carpet could use a washing. With all that said, this place is still fine for one or two nights. The staff here were friendly and helpful overall. The noise level from the roads were manageable.",2022-08-04T16:42:06Z,37
3195,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites North Vancouver,3.4,"We attended a 'private function' - a senior friend's birthday party - at this 'Holiday Inn' recently, our second experience attending a private function of theirs held at this venue.   And like the previous function, the Hotel did a fine job with the arrangements - room, amenities, and provision of buffet brunch-lunch.

Our hosts (""birthday boy"" and lovely wife), did a great job organizing the event.  The party itself received an attendance turnout of some 63 guests, from their initial list of 70 names of family and friends contacted.  And the hotel's chosen room, and agreed to table/amenities arrangements were just right -- with 9 guests arranged at each of 7 large round tables --  cozy, though not crammed - allowing decent spaces amongst tables, for guests to get up and mingle, and to get to both sides and ends of the room, to access buffet setups, and other side table offerings at their leisure.

Lunch was 'called' about 11:30 am, with each table, as called, asked to proceed to the buffet setup.  The Hotel had provided a lovely-looking, and tasty spread of brunch offerings -- starting with a selection of breads, croissants, and bread-pastries, an Indian 'pakora' appetizer, tossed green salad, several 'hot dish' main entrees - pan fried potatoes, scrambled eggs, eggs Benedict, an Indian 'lasagna', pancakes, sausages, sliced bacon & ham, and ending with salmon fillets - and side tables of a lovely, selection of fresh fruits (and ripe as well!!), cakes, and other desserts & fruit juices (hot beverages - coffees, and teas - had always been available, on a side table on the other side of the room).  And later, the birthday cake was presented, cut, and served from a table at the opposite end of the room.

Our 'big thanks' to the 'Holiday Inn', and our wonderful hosts, for such a much-enjoyed event!!",2019-09-09T17:14:33Z,37
3196,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites North Vancouver,3.4,"I was on a vacation with my wife in September of 2022. We decided to stay 10 days in Vancouver and had pre-booked the hotel ahead of the arrival. I even had paid for it before arriving in Vancouver. When I arrived I contacted to hotel to see if there is any shuttle service to take me to the hotel, Holiday Inn, North Vancouver.    I was greeted by an obnoxious man by the name of Aneez.   Not only he told me that I don't have any reservations, he had also mentioned that the entire hotel is booked and that they have no rooms available.  Remember, I was on a 5 hour flight, restless, and now no reservations despite that fact that IHG had already securely my room and taken the payment out. I told Mr. Aneez on the phone that I have no other reservations and that I will be calling IHG to complain since I was a IHG remember.   Mr. Aneez said that he doesn't care what I had to do and that there are no rooms available. Once I called IHG, they had promised that the room should be available to me and that I should make my way to the hotel and demand that my room be restored. Once I made my way to the hotel and again was confronted by the obnoxious Aneez at front desk just to hear the same  story that there are no rooms available.  This obnoxious man did not make effort to accompany me and just asked me to call around to other Holiday Inns in the area. While I was doing that and was completely upset, I saw that Aneez treats other guests in the hotel in the same manner, very obnoxious and with an attitude.   This man, ""Aneez"" should not be in the hospitality business altogether. Throughout my encounter with him at the front desk he kept telling me that ""today is not his day"". My question is when you are in the hospitality business, you can not treat people and guests with an attitude and if today is not your day, you should not be at work altogether. I am very disappointed with the experience I had at Holiday Inn, North Vancouver.   Stay AWAY from this hotel as long as ANEEZ is there.",2022-12-09T19:15:34Z,37

Normally we enjoy our stay.. thou on our last stay, we where signing in noticing a bunch of teenagers everywhere (some girls soccer team over from nanaimo) when we found our room we found it was directly across from the elevator on the second floor. We went straight back down to ask if we can get a different room concerned about the noise from the elevator and the kids. We where told all the kids where on the second floor, they won't be a issue for us during our stay..... boy oh boy!!! There most have been 40 or so kids running, yelling, hanging out in the common area in front of the elevator area (just in front of our room). We did our best at 930 asking the kids to keep it down, please be respectful to the other people staying in the hotel many many times.. called down to front desk, they said there's nothing that can be done til security gets there. Almost paying $400 for the room we decided to leave. I don't understand why the parents/supervisors where not hold accountable for the children's behaviour or respect for the other people staying in the hotel. I will not be staying at this hotel again.

3201,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites North Vancouver,3.4,"Ahh, Holiday Inns, home to many travelers, adventurers, and trekkers.  This Holiday Inn Hotel and Suites is located North of downtown Vancouver area and a great option for a clean, modern, and somewhat affordable room.  This Holiday Inn opened in 2000, 16 years ago, so I'm surprised why there are only 15 reviews.  

Price ranges from $180 to $240 Canadian dollars a night.  For the cost it is in the $$1/2 range. 

Our queen room was perfect for our stay in Vancouver as it was definitely a step up from our motel 6 stay in Seattle. They have a nice pool, a great size jacuzzi, and a small workout room which I used. You have to use your card to access the elevators and other areas.  Service was on spot as host was helpful and had no complaints of the maid. 

The facade is beautiful and had a small totem pole and tiny waterfall. Also, I liked the sign pole of how many km cities like London was located.  Tips-It has free parking, not like other places in downtown area.  
  
The location isn't the best however, as there is only a Pub nearby.  There aren't many things to do around here except hunt for Pokemon on Pokemon Go. So, I suppose if you don't have a car, it would be difficult to explore the city life by walking.",2016-07-22T05:22:35Z,37

3 1/2 stars.

I like the overall physical appearance of the building from the outside.  It's very much like from the Victorian era.  Sort of.  Looks like a castle even deep within the forest even.  Well it does in my eyes.   But the property is in need for major upgrade.  And if you want guests to rate your establishment a 4 or higher,  interior needs help like yesterday...

Furnishings and interior design are very dated.   We ended up here during our visit for Vancouver for a few days.   It was centrally located to places we were going to visit- Capilano and Granville Island and dt Vancouver. 

It did serve it's purpose but I do like admiring hotels i stay at whether it's their architectural structure, a specific characteristic of the property, exterior and interior design, layout, comfy beddings, modern look and feel, updated bathroom,etc... you know, basic aesthetics. This just didn't cut it.  Although I liked the picturesque view of the property from outside as you pull in, it needs help inside.

They do have the indoor poor next to their well equipped gym that had your basic needs for a good workout- a few treadmills and elliptical, free weights, weight machines, etc.  I also liked how the gym is separated from the pool by a floor to ceiling glass window. Definitely a plus.

In house staff including housekeeping were friendly and attentive  which I appreciated.   And parking is free.

They have a pool, gym, and a laundry facility available for guests to use. During our short stay it seemed like a popular hotel for large groups to stay in. Free parking and never had a problem finding a spot close to the lobby. its about a 10 minute drive to Capilano and a 20-25 min drive to downtown.

Minus one star for no included breakfast buffet which for some reason I thought was included in our stay when booking through hotels.com. Also wish the A/C unit wasn't directly beside our bed, when it was on the cold air was directly on us which was kinda uncomfortable.

Other than those things, would stay here again and recommend to others.",2016-06-21T22:11:10Z,37

The hotel is fine but for the price.....I can stay in one of the swankiest hotels in Vancouver, the Parq, for less than $100 more. The price is absolutely appalling for what you get.

We were greeted by two very friendly and helpful gentleman at the front desk who answered our every question on transit and navigation while in the area. They also offered very helpful suggestions on sightseeing and how to avoid some of the more tourists traps. 

The only reason I am giving this hotel four stars instead of five is that when we were booking  it seemed as if we were getting a suite instead of a two queen beds normal room. It was a little tighter than we had planned for our near weeklong stay.  Unfortunately we came in on Canada day and that meant that the hotel was booked, no more suites. 

I will also say that I was very impressed by the management and the front desk staff at handling two situations with the same lunatic woman who was making irrational complaints and yelling at the top of her lungs. I was surprised at first of the type of complaint, then after listening I understood ""you can't fix crazy.""  

I would most definitely say that any future trip that we make back to the area we will certainly consider staying here. Proximity to all attractions and ease of transportation would've been on their own enough.

I have stay many places in Vancouver and this was about the least impressive with the exception of a Best Western that was in the process of being remodeled. 

The property was also off the beaten path and not in walking distance to anything. The room had some kinda crazy climate. It was just uncomfortable. I was in a fight with the thermostat the entire time. I don't think I have ever seen a room with humidity control, but there should be instructions because until you have experienced cold and muggy or tropical humidity, don't judge my anger. 

Now, the place had free parking and wifi, but lacked the complimentary breakfast that I have come to expect. 

If I'm not mistaken, Playland was fairly close, so that would be one reason to choose this location, but based on my experience, I wouldn't return, even as a complimentary guest.

Main drawback was that I was never comfortable during the night.  Heating/cooling system was functional, but we never settled into the place during our 2 night stay.

There's a small market across the street that's very convenient for amenities, but otherwise there isn't much in the area other than the Lynn Canyon suspension bridge, which I highly recommend checking out! It seems a little pricey for the area, but there aren't many options to begin with.

Yet, it was way better than the Ramada Inn we were set on staying in off of Granville Street in Downtown Vancouver. This Holiday Inn is located right off of Highway 1/Trans-Canada at the Lillooet/Fern Road exit. It's actually located in North Vancouver, so it seems like you are not really in a metropolitan area. Once you cross the Iron Worker's Bridge, you enter North Vancouver, and the area around the Holiday Inn is more residential - which I actually really enjoyed. I went for a jog in the morning around the neighborhood, and it was quiet, no stoplights to wait for, and the residents really upkeep their neighborhoods curb appeal. 

As for the hotel, check-in was quick and painless and the attendants were really friendly. The rooms seemed either new or renovated (not really sure when the hotel was opened), and the grounds were well kept. Rooms are standard for upgraded higher-end Holiday Inns, and were spotless and extremely clean. Ordered room service which was brought up to us from the restaurant on-sight (not located in the hotel, but in a separate building on the periphery of parking lot). Order clam chowder with garlic bread, both were actually pretty good, some of the better Holiday Inn room service I've had.

3224,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites North Vancouver,3.4,"I have stayed at Holiday Inn Express hotels a number of times and haven't had much to complain about. This one however, was a bit below the standard I expected.   The entrance and lobby were very nice, as were the hallways. All the common areas were clean and nicely decorated. The room though, was below the standard of the rest of the hotel. The only real ""perk"" was one of those tiny coffee makers with one package of coffee. There was no refrigerator or microwave. My room was strategically positioned above a pub entrance and since I stayed a Friday and a Saturday night, the rowdy outdoor smokers chatting blended nicely with the street noise.        These complaints may seem petty, and they probably are, but for the price I paid per night I truly expected more.                    Would I stay at another Holiday Inn Express? Yes      Would I stay at this one again? No.",2014-05-19T11:45:03Z,37

While checking into the hotel she informed us that they have regular checks every couple months for bed bugs using dogs.  This was very helpful information.  They also have mattress protectors to prevent bed bugs.  Rooms are very nice, large, clean, and have a kitchenette.  The hotel is very clean.  Easy and fast check in.  They have luggage carts which was great.  Nice AC  too.  You have to have a hotel room key in order to get in the elevator which I thought was good for security.

Our young guest loves it immediately due to this little duck hunt she had to engage in upon arrival.  She loves the duck so much we asked the manager if we could purchase it when we checked out.  He actually gave her that one and allowed her to pick out another one!  That's amazing customer service.  

The room was clean, well stocked and quiet--wick is a must when traveling.  Anything we needed they had.  

Comfortable beds, warm blankets and a powerful shower.  Loved it.

3228,Accent Inn Burnaby,4.1,"Stayed a few nights last month in this place. The site I booked it said this place is ""unique"". They were not wrong. There is a sense of joy and wonder around the place, from the location to the signs around the place (I took some pictures). 

We were checked in by a very cheerful guy, Faisal. We were trying to get the names of the places to eat and he gladly helped. The few nights I was there my interactions with the staff were amazing. Always friendly, respectful, helpful and friendly. The hotel itself has a big parking lot and a bunch of restaurants within the walking distance. The rooms were clean and spacious.  The signage in the hotel still was the best. Just made me happy coming in. Their elevator said ""Flight Simulator"" on the outside and inside looked like a hot air ride balloon.

1.  No continental breakfast even though it says they have one.  No restaurant either.  Guys!  Put out some granola bars and some apples and oranges in the morning!  Talk about cheap!

2.  Long black hairs in my bed.  Utterly disgusting. 

3.  The WI-FI only worked half the time.  It's there. I can see it on my phone.  Just cannot consistently connect to it.  This is unacceptable in 2022. 

4.  Audio did not work on the channels that showed Monday Night Football.  This was the only channel on which this happened.  What's worse is there technician told me they know about but haven't fixed it. 

5.  Tiny bath towels. How hard would it be to invest in towels that are man sized?

6.  No water bottles for guests, and absolutely no place within walking distance to get basic items like water or snacks.  

The hotel management simply cuts corners and doesn't provide basic necessities and appreciation for their guests.",2022-09-14T04:35:23Z,20

There's always people sitting on the walkway on an office chair from their room.  Don't know what they are doing out in the walkways.  There's a restaurant connected to the inn.  Other restaurants are probably not within walking distance but with a car, you'll be able to get to a lot of great food options.  There's a McDonald's close by.

The hotel cleaning staff here has no respect for the do not disturb sign on the door. I've been woken up at all hours. The front desk staff has fed me some pathetic line about hotel policy being that they need to clean my room every three days. I've even been lied to and told that there is a law called the housekeepers law that allows them to do this. I've looked it up and there is no such law in Bc. 

Avoid this place if you work nights and sleep in. Instead, stay at the executive hotel a few blocks away. That place is ACTUALLY a hotel, instead of a glorified motel. Half our company stayed there, and loved it.",2015-09-05T16:33:17Z,20

3236,Accent Inn Burnaby,4.1,"Let me start by gushing about how soft the beds are. It was like sleeping on a cloud.

However, it didn't really justify the really rude night staff. Nor the cramped kitchenette vanity sink all-in-one area. Or the ridiculously loud AC positioned at the head of the bed. Or the old carpet and musty linens. 

What really took the cake was the horrible night desk person. I booked through hotels.com and figured it would have been already paid for. Upon check in, he asked for a credit card like usual. Then without asking or explaining, he charged $250. I disputed, showing him the email that the room was reserved at $100. He said I didn't pay. But that was it. It may have took him 5 more words to explain that the other charge was a security deposit but he couldn't even do that. He simply kept shouting NO NO NO like he didn't speak English. 

The morning staff were much friendlier and it wasn't until then that everything was explained. What a horrible place to find hospitality. I wouldn't stay here again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else.",2013-07-03T19:35:15Z,20

The hotel is conveniently located, close to malls and easy access to the highway and main streets leading to Vancouver, North & West Vancouver, and the Airport.

The studio paid for me to stay in the room since we had to do a 13 hour day shoot followed by 4 - 5 hours of interiors with an early call time, therefore, it was easier to have the crew stay across the street. The hotel rooms themselves in terms of decor are seriously out dated. I get that it is more of a budget in, however, more effort could be made to have these look a little more modern. I felt as though I was staying in a motel of a David Lynch film. Very little amenities.

The Accent Inn staff couldn't have done more to ease our stay and even offered us a discount. We were very pleased with our choice and would recommend it highly, whether or not you come with a pet. 

Pros
Very pet friendly: they fly a flag at the entrance saying ""We Love Pets!"" and they mean it!
Discount offered to those who are there due to a pet receiving emergency care at  Canada West Hospital a few blocks away
Very helpful and friendly staff
Comfortable beds
Quiet air conditioners
Microwave and good-sized fridge 
Delicious coffee and tea in the reception area
24 hour maintenance (didn't need it, but good to know it's there)
Numerous good restaurants in the near vicinity
Skytrain stop a block away

We were never disturbed and our room was made up every day.  The desk staff were helpful, polite, and very courteous.  One night we thought we had a message on the phone in the early hours, and went to the desk to check as it didn't come through we saw the security guard casually walking the hotel and the parking lot, and the night staff were very kind helping us figure out the message.  The room is quite nice for a hotel and the addition of the small but extremely convenient mini kitchen was great.  Quite frankly I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, in fact I will when I come back to visit Vancouver. Oh and another plus it is a short walk to the sky train, but if you can't walk they have a shuttle that will take you the few blocks.  On the sky train its only 20 minutes to downtown Vancouver and I wouldn't drive there. There is a newspaper everyday in the lobby for you; apples and coffee there as well, and recycle bins in the room.

I then said that I just wanted to suggest that they clean the room, and was about to give them the room number when the person hung up on me.

FIRST THING ARE BED BUGS !!!!!!! Those nasty f*cking things are quite common here, as I complained about it and the guy just told me he didn#t know thiw this from THAT room, hello??? No refund or help, NOTHING ! 

The area around main street it sketchy and there are a lot of strang people running arnoud, but there not dangerous. 

Please do me a favour and don't park your rental car at the public pay parlking lot which is behind the motel at 5th East Av. Our car was broking into and this is normal as the security guy told us. A Nomral day is one or two cars whcih where broken into. The parking lot of the motel seems safe but the area is known to be a risk.

The rooms seems to be from the 60's maybe 70's but for 111 CAN$ for a motel room which is dirty, smelly and not is a safe neighbourhood this motel sucks.",2015-10-24T12:11:34Z,14

3252,City Centre Motor Hotel,1.9,"The entire trip started out with a special on Choice Hotels.  My guy called me all excited that Choice Hotels were having a special and did I want to go up to Vancouver for a weekend.  I said sure and he went about the business of reserving and buying tickets and such.

Fast forward to, Choice Hotels didn't have any rooms available so he opted to pick the City Centre Motor Hotel.  Well, I was a bit scared just by the name but decided to have an open mind (ok, I tried.  It's not that easy for me).

This is really of the ilk of the Motel Six.  Now, don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with a Motel Six but I'm not really a fan.  The Marriott or the Hilton are more my style so when we had to go out to buy soap (there's was so tiny) I longed for the bigger sized soaps I normally find in the Marriotts.  

I was too scared (read whiny) to use the in room glasses and went to the Army/Navy store to buy a camping mug to drink out of while in the room.

The bed was not that bad a little lumpy but honestly, I've had worse at Mcmenamins.

No coffee maker in the room.  I looked for an ice maker but there was no ice bucket so even if I had found one, I'm not sure I what I would have done with it.

While surfing the internet on my phone I discovered they have free wi fi. I didn't check it out.  Maybe I should have I still haven't gotten the bill for International websurfing on the phone.

Good location in the yuppy, hipster, Mount Pleasant district (oh, how well they know me) and right on the bus line.

It was nice and quiet.  And, although,  I didn't run over there, there was a Safeway on the back side of the hotel within walking distance.

There are up and downstairs rooms.  We had an upstairs room and the only way to get to it was to go up the stairs.  I didn't view an elevator.

They still use keys for the room doors and the doors open out to the street.

All in all for $80 a night it was inexpensive and it worked out.  If I had it to do again, I would stay somewhere a bit nicer but it had everything you need.  We just made sure we were out seeing the sights more than hanging out in the room.",2011-09-21T00:59:15Z,14

3256,City Centre Motor Hotel,1.9,"The main (good) thing that can be said for this hotel is the price is significantly lower than other hotels in Downtown.  (To be precise, this hotel is in Mt. Pleasant, but close enough.)  You do get what you pay for though.

What you pay for is a tired hotel room with a bed, heat, a roof over your head, and working sink and shower.  Oh and technically you get soap, although the bar is the size of a communion wafer (for non-Catholics that's about the size of a Toonie...for non-Canadian non-Catholics, ah, a little bigger than a quarter), good for maybe a couple of face washings or 5-10 hand washings.  DO NOT expect any luxuries from this hotel.  We came into town around midnight and had to stand outside and speak through a little box-office style window to check in.  Upon check-in we got our old school room keys and the remote to the old school TV.  I can't imagine who steals the remote to a circa 1991 TV, but fine, whatever.

Our fellow guests at the hotel looked like people who would prefer to keep a low profile in a town known for its green produce.  However, our stay was incident-free and the hotel staff were quite friendly.  I would say if you're looking to save money, don't mind things a little on the Spartan side, and aren't overly squeamish about cleanliness or ""roughness"" then this would be a good option for you.",2011-11-06T20:48:17Z,14

3258,City Centre Motor Hotel,1.9,"I booked this motel because of the Trip Advisor and Google+ reviews. I have to wonder if some of the positive reviews were planted (Many of the positive reviews are by people with only one review).

Front desk staff were friendly on check in and check out - but the rooms and the motel's control of what happens in their parking lot were dismal.

Regarding the rooms - my room smelled terrible. Somewhere between mold, dust, and some kind of chemical. I should have asked to change rooms - but I was in a hurry to go pick up somebody at the airport. 

The room appeared clean but I was afraid to look to carefully. All the furniture was marked up and probably relics of the 70's. The carpet looked like it was last cleaned in that decade as well. The bathrooms are small but adequate - mine having some new lino on the floor. However, you get something the size of a hand towel instead of a bath towel - and there is no shampoo. The walls were pretty beat up in the room as well.

The smell in the room affected my allergies - and it was hard to sleep - and I regret not changing hotels after arriving.

Now about the activities.

On the first night (a Friday) we witnessed a prostitute yelling at some guy in the parking lot at about 9pm when we got back to the hotel. Then another prostitute arguing with a taxi driver about 20 minutes later. Lots of sketchy people hanging around the hotel. At 12 am some guy was on his cell phone outside my door making very loud calls on his phone - the first to his dealer looking for him to come down to sell him some coke, and the second to some woman who we was trying to convince to come down to ""party"". This went on for over an hour. 

On the second night there I witnessed another prostitute being dropped off by taxi (who looked like she was zonked out on drugs) and going into one of the rooms next to mine, more sketchy people driving into the parking lot or hanging out in the parking lot. Lot's a yelling and ""Whooooo"" coming from somewhere (neighbouring rooms, parking lot?) until about 2:30 in the morning. Some guy in a car in the parking lot was also blasting club music with a massive low end bass for about 15 minutes around midnight.

The quilts on beds could use some upgrading, but the room was spacious, and the bathroom had been upgraded and was fine. Lots of lighting in the room, which is always welcome.

We were woken up in the middle of the night by two people deciding to have a conversation and could hear most of what was going on in the rooms next to us.,2016-10-09T18:23:25Z,6
3266,Horseshoe Bay Motel,3.5,"Well this just turned out to be the worst place possible to stay if you wanted to rest after a long day.  Paid way to much for a king bed ( if that's what you call that type of mattress) and received for our $169 the corner room next to the stop sign.  Not that this was bad enough but needed to have window open for air flow ( no in room ventilation except for ceiling fan) and we heard every mouse fart in a 1/4 mile along with every truck, drunk, and kid all night long while not being able to get comfortable due to mattress and temperature.    This is not a place we will recommend.   The reason for the 2 star is simply our mistake not researching more before booking the non refundable room",2017-06-29T05:20:11Z,6
3267,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,Very accessible to the city. Lovely rooms. PLEASE get your other elevator fixed. There's only one for 32 floors making it a huge hassle to go anywhere.,2023-10-17T18:58:15Z,26
3268,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"We stayed at the WorldMark Vancouver in late February 2020 and it was the last time we have stayed anywhere due to the Covid-19 virus. We enjoyed our stay and from staying at other WorldMark properties in the past we knew it would be fine. Part of the property is condos and part is a hotel.

It's a good central location and close to restaurants, food markets, and museums. The entrance is very low key and we almost missed it, but it serves its purpose. The room was very nice, but small. We stayed for 2 days and it was fine. It would have been too small for 2 weeks though. We did use the kitchen one night and it was fine.

We will stay here again in the future.",2020-11-11T02:48:18Z,26
3269,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"2nd time staying there, even better than the first! I returned for the yearly fireworks festival. This time my friend & I researched activities & parks. The timeshare is so well located, near everything, great parking, clean & well kept. Nice to have 2 bathrooms & a washer/dryer in unit...I went home with clean clothes. And the recycling in the building is impressive, compost, plastic, glass & regular garbage.",2019-08-08T21:31:36Z,26
3270,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"We loved this place we stayed for 7 nights.  View...wow!!!Great location but be prepared that being in downtown..it gets noisy even when staying on 23rd floor of a 32 floor building.  We heard police and ambulance sirens every night. IGA market is just 10 min walk away.  Money exchange is about 15 min walk.  Many small eateries around within steps of the building including a museum.
Being a worldmark owner from the USA, the staff were awesome.  Top notch! Our unit was cold and we asked for extra blankets and the maintenace guy delivered within minutes.  In addition, he spent time to show us how to turn the heaters on and also the fireplace.  The only complaint I had was the long wait for the elevators but WM had warned us ahead of time as they were being remodeled. When I checked out and headed to airport, I accidently left the cupholder for the carseat in the unit.  I called back and told them.  Drove back to condo within 15 min and Tyler had gone up to the unit to retrieve it.  Wondering if he ran up the stairs as wait for elevators took at least that much time. So appreciated !!  Would definitely recc this place.",2019-07-06T17:37:37Z,26
3271,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"What a great view and location. We took a five minute taxi ride from the cruise ship terminal, and were able to leave our bags, walk around town, find some free Wifi at a nearby coffee shop, and walk to the art museum  until check in time at 3 pm.
Our well stocked, modern, clean condo unit on the 20th floor was major overkill for a one night stay, but what the heck. We had views over downtown Vancouver in two directions, a dining area and a fully equipped kitchen, a living room with fireplace and television, plus a  TV in the bedroom. The tiny check-in lobby has binders full of DVDs to borrow for free, although there is a nice movie theater two blocks away as well as several nice restaurants and fun bars nearby. We walked everywhere at night, no worries. I would definitely stay here again.",2015-12-19T16:52:02Z,26
3272,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"We were heading to Vancouver, and our friend offered to let us use her time share condo days to stay at the WorldMark The Canadian. What a treat!

It is centrally located in downtown Vancouver, in easy walking distance to restaurants, theaters, museums and the glitzy shopping district.  The unit Er stayed in has 2 bedrooms, kitchen and living room.  The kitchen is fully stocked, and there is a cozy breakfast nook off of it with great views of the district.

Fireplace, TV's with CD players in the living room and master bedroom.  Comfortable furnishings throughout. 

The staff are friendly and the front desk has a large selections of DVD available to rent.

This would be a great place for a family on a budget. You wouldn't have to eat out every meal.",2015-12-04T02:49:08Z,26
3273,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"Great unit, probably one of the most elegant WM in the chain. Great location in the city as it's very central to everything. Fabulous views from the units. 19th to 26th floor of a 31 floor high rise. Full granite kitchen, washer dryer, gym and indoor pool. Parking is free and secured underground. The only negative is the street noise. Even though you're on the 19th or 26th floor with the windows open you will hear heavy traffic, car horns and sirens going to the hospital across the street. 

Food: Check out Samurai Japanese rest for Sushi, Stepho's Souvlaki for Greek, Bistro 101 (they have discount cards in the lobby for B 101), and Milltown bar and grill.

You can get from the airport to downtown vancouver by taking the skytrain from airport parking lot for $2, once you get to the city you can walk 5 blocks or jump a taxi.

Update 8/2017. Worldmark is still great!! They added portable a/c units in the living room to take the edge off the warmer days. DVD player does not play blue-ray. They skytrain from the airport is now $9.75 but $4.75 to get there. Linh cafe is amazing for lunch, but check for days open.",2015-08-06T15:22:27Z,26
3274,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"The entrance to the actual check-in is a bit tough to find but once you do the employees were knowledgable and efficient in their work. 

However they charge for the internet.  The WorldMark in Victoria did not, but gave us a free code. 

Also there is no business center.  This would be a good addition, dear management.  Diss the pool table and bring in a couple of Dell computers would be nicer. 

The view was cool, looking over the Vancouver urban landscape from our 20th floor apartment.  

Tip:  Open the door under the stove to get your frying pan!

3276,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"My brother and I stayed here for a couple nights during the Olympics in a 1-bedroom unit.

The view and the cleanliness of the room was incredible! The staff was very friendly and helpful.

The unit was a little small, but had all the standard amenities of a Worldmark unit, except one... The couch was only a couch, not a sofa bed like most resorts. 

This might not seem like such a big deal unless you're traveling with your brother and aren't big bed sharers. He got the couch (cause I'm the owner), and thankfully he only had to rock the couch for 2 nights.

Other than that, the fireplace controls were strange (2 switches and a dial to control), but the view, the proximity, and the unit were great!",2010-02-24T21:23:47Z,26
3277,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"I've stayed at quite a few Worldmark locations, and no matter where I am, I feel like I'm home.  They're all decorated in the same style and resemble each other, so when you've stayed at any Worldmark a few times, all the locations begin to feel like home away from home.

I love Worldmark because of the kitchens and washer and dryers in the units.  Everything is upscale and clean.  Most locations offer a free movie rental.

This particular location allows guests usage of the fitness center at the Sheraton across the street.  Its downtown location is also perfect -- we walked to most of our destinations.  There is garage parking and paid wifi.

Happy vacationing!",2015-07-30T07:38:33Z,26

Plus the view from our room was spectacular.",2015-06-06T14:20:51Z,26
3280,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"i was really excited to see what this place looked like on the inside since i saw the exterior pictures on the website (but didn't dig further to look for interior shots). this timeshare is smaller than the ones we're used to in the US, but it's highrise living, so i guess it's to be expected. 

pretty standard amenities, although there isn't a sofa bed. if you're going to put four people in here, there will be two people per bed. :\ (not good news for me and my brother...i think i'll be sleeping on the couch. gah.)

there's underground parking but the spaces are very cramped, so be careful if you have a large car! location-wise, it's pretty central. you can walk to many attractions, although it could be quite a long walk. they only give out as many parking permits as there are spaces, so you should have a spot left downstairs if you take your car instead of going by foot. 

internet is available, but no wifi. you have to go downstairs to the lobby and check out a router that plugs into the power outlet, giving you a wired connection (one cable only). as of this writing, it's $4.95/day, $15.95 for 10 days, $49.95 for one year. 

today, one of the elevators (out of two) is stuck on the 25th floor (apparently a lady got trapped in there earlier today, but they got her out quickly) and they're getting it repaired. i hope it's soon because at times the waits were over 10 minutes just to use the elevator. worse when many people are moving in because the luggage carts take up the place of three people.",2008-12-14T00:57:32Z,26
3281,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"Amazing hotel, service, and room view. Bit of a struggle trying to get out of the parking garage (separate towers awkwardly connect, told to go to different gate in car to exit as guest,swipe card didn't work at gate 1 and 2...couldn't find gate 3) but other than that, amazing experience. Love the hotel and will be back out next stay in Vancouver. Still amazing hotel and service.",2019-08-27T06:55:23Z,26
3282,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"A great location in the heart of Vancouver.  A short walk to all of the restaurants on Robson street or to take the ferry to the marketplace.  A couple blocks gets you to Davie street.  Stayed in a 2 bedroom unit and it was quite clean.  Bedrooms tend to be on the smaller side, but it is an urban high-rise.  The only real downside was that the kitchen table is a bit ridiculous in its placement and size.  

The unit has permanent residents and Worldmark has several floors, so you get a blue key and a red key in order to gain access to various security doors.  Thankfully, there is no sales office so you don't have to endure a back and forth about why you don't want to go to another presentation.  Staff at the front desk are extremely friendly and helpful in helping you navigate around the city.

The check-in is to the side of the main building entrance. If you brought a car, there is parking available, but residents will try and tail you into the garage as the door opens even though there is a sign that says not to.",2014-06-19T01:54:29Z,26
3283,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"Stayed for two weeks between 21st Jan - 16th Feb. One of the best locations you could hope for. Very close to everything. We stayed for two weeks in two different apartments in the building. 2 Bed compact and 2 Bed with a small dining area. Both were immaculate and well beyond our expectations. Amazing views in both. The kitchen was just big enough and perfect for cooking when you felt like staying in. Always had a great night sleep in the comfortable beds, plenty of closet space for suitcases etc. & having a washer and dryer came in so handy. Ladies at the front desk were so lovely and friendly too - always helping us with absolutely anything we needed.

3284,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"I love this Resort. The rooms are small but the Resort is in a PRIME location and the view is spectacular. To the other reviewers, read the occupancy guidelines. The One Bedroom states that it is compact and only sleeps two. The Two Bedroom also says compact and sleeps four. You are not going to be spending much time in your room and the PRIME location is worth the smaller rooms. 

Vancouver is such a cool city and you are staying in the heart of it. I highly recommend buying an Attractions pass www.seevancouvercard.com. This is the one city I have found this pass to be most useful. Vancouver is a compact city and has an excellent Public Transportation system. You do not want or need a car here. Even if you are going out of the city you should be able to get around without a car using their system.

The Resort is more like staying in a high rise condo. There is a full kitchen and Laundry in your unit. There is a grocery nearby. The staff is quite helpful and will be able to assist you in area information. This is not really a kid friendly location and to be honest, younger kids will not get much out of a trip to Vancouver. It is a lovely city with a heart of gold. The people are very friendly and welcoming and tolerant. Americans should have no problems navigating the city. I can't wait to get back.",2010-05-24T04:33:59Z,26
3285,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"Could not ask for a more convenient location, this is literally almost dead center of downtown.  Near tons of restaurants, coffee, shopping, things to do.  A lot of things are open very late.

Although I hear this is one of the smaller Worldmark 1-bedroom suites, the size was good enough to suit my husband and I.  The bed (which seemed like it couldn't be bigger than queen although I think it was supposed to be king) was too small, but comfortable enough apart from feeling too small to share.  More of a younger crowd than usual here.

Cons - A little tricky to locate where the entrance was, having arrived after dark.  Weak toilet did clog up during our stay with normal activity and had to plunge a lot to clear.  A LOT of traffic and construction noise - bring your earplugs!

Although I did feel a lot safer than downtown San Francisco and the hobos don't harass you as directly, the neighborhood does get significantly more sketchy after dark, most markedly after 9 pm.  Davie and Granville are especially to be avoided late night, I would say.  One night on the way to grab dinner, a obviously off his meds homeless man ran right near us into moving traffic hitting things and screaming.  So keep your eyes open and your excess valuables in your room.

Restaurant recommendations - Le Crocodile, The Mexican, Glowbal Grill, Banana Leaf, La Brasserie.",2012-10-22T05:24:14Z,26
3286,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"This is a beautiful property. You wouldn't really know it, from the outside. You're dropped off on a one way street, and barely notice the Worldmark Sign.  The front staff was super friendly and very welcoming. Our room wasn't ready, but that was okay. We knew we were early (about 11:00am).  So, on their recommendation, we walked to ""Earl's Test Kitchen"" for a delicious lunch.
After lunch, our room was ready. We were on the 21st floor. When I opened the door, I thought ""oooh"" and ""ahhhhhhh"".  We had a bird's eye view of downtown Vancouver.  The kitchen was super cute-- bigger than I expected. The ""dining nook"" was beyond cute. It was tucked in the corner with floor to ceiling windows. I felt like we were in a glass cage, watching people and traffic below.  Just loved the view!  
Our bedroom was comfortable, though no dressers. There were shelves in the closet, though, and plenty of room.  Again, floor to ceiling windows.  I was nervous about voyeurs, so I made sure to close the blinds anytime one of us had to walk around in our birthday suits and such.  It was nice to look outside, why laying in bed.  So much to see! (But, I was covered up and dressed at the time-- LOL!)  
We had a full-sized washer and a small dryer-- and I love that convenience with Worldmark.  The bathroom is a little small, but very clean, with shelving and a built-in night light. 
The location is really nice, and we felt safe walking around. We found a great Japanese restaurant, there are Starbucks on just about every block. We never did use the health club privileges at the Sheraton (across the street).  I'm sure it was nice, but I missed not being able to slip into my bathing suit and robe and just walk out to a hot tub.  But, this is City Life, and that's how it is....
I have nothing but great things to say about the front office staff. Every single person was always polite and very helpful.  We felt very welcome, here, and really enjoyed our stay at this property.
We got lucky with super warm weather, and the floor fans that were provided kept our home away from home very cool and comfortable.  It's nice to find that WM has upgraded their properties to have flat screen TV's (we stayed at some, a few years ago, that didn't have that.)
I could never be an urban dweller, but it was a fun experience to ""live"" in a place so high up with lots of windows and light. At night, it was even more spectacular.  Terrific property that exceeded my expectations!",2014-07-20T22:59:20Z,26
3287,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"Stayed there from 8/19-26/2-16.

Had a one bedroom condo, 20th floor. Very spacious and well decorated. Bring your binoculars. Amazing views from room 2006. Kitchen, dining room, living room, bath and bedroom with queen bed. Lots of storage space, including stacked washer and dryer. No tidy service, but if you call, they will bring you new linens. No toiletries in the room, so bring your own shampoo and conditioner. The Canadian, as well as most of Vancouver, is very environmentally conscious. They recycle most everything-including any food waste. We spent the week there and had very little garbage-mainly plastic bags. You just put your recycling containers out in the morning and they are quickly picked up. The rooms can get very warm, but there is a standing a/c unit in the living room and a strong fan in the bedroom. We discovered on our last night, that if you turn the a/c unit towards the fireplace, the air circulates just fine. Just be sure to turn on the air and close the blinds before you leave, if it's going to be a warm day.

Very well located and most places are within walking distance. There is a IGA grocery store just three blocks away, which is quite walkable. The IGA is a great store, with lots of delicious items, already prepared. Great fruit & veggie selection, as well as fresh flowers and a well stocked meat department upstairs. There is a parking garage nearby the store, but it was a quick and easy walk there.",2016-09-06T20:51:44Z,26

Our ice maker wasn't working, so we called the front desk for help.  She advised us to buy our own ice.  When we asked for her to provide a better solution, she told us that they were sold out, she was the only one on duty and would get us ice from another suite when she had time.  No ice, no repair.

3292,WorldMark Vancouver - The Canadian,4.3,"Got to spend two nights here as a sort of favour for an auto incident. Perhaps I gave it a four cause it was free for us. And its not like we get to go on many free trips. The condo was definitely..small. But hey, you're in the middle of a big city! You shouldnt be spending all your time in the room. As for the condo, the kitchen was very clean and the appliances were new (but we didnt use them), the living room was alright, the furniture was uncomfortable, but the tv was nice. Bedrooms and bathrooms were clean. Overall, we had a great time. We had a view of some of the big buildings which was neat, but not the downtown core. 
We never used the pool/spa facilities, but, if you want to, you gotta go to the Sheraton across the street. Probably a little annoying.
The hotel is a little ways from the heart of the city (Gastown, Stadiums, etc.), but its not a bad walk. The city is beautiful. I'd definitely stay here again.",2010-12-15T06:27:09Z,26

As someone who is a chronic mega-hotel chain lover, I was a little bit wary of a smaller independently run and owned hotel, but I couldn't recommend the Victorian more highly. Do your research and make sure you know what kind of room you're booking (they don't have an elevator and they offer rooms without en suite bathrooms, ie. you'll have to share) but the room itself was absolutely beautiful. It's a little loud because you're on the border of Gastown, but it's nothing that I couldn't sleep through. I also was stunned by how beautiful the bathroom itself actually was (LOL). The rain shower was amazing and despite the sliding door, was really well ventilated. Would absolutely stay here again!",2023-10-30T21:33:54Z,67
3294,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"I was disappointed with my stay here, but it's not all bad so here we go... 

The pros: Absolutely beautiful building! Quaint and rustic but with modern decor and refurbishment. Staff were very friendly. Our room was very clean, bed was comfy, large bathroom. 

The cons: Prepare for your view to be of trash cans unless you really want to shell out a pretty penny. Which leads me to pricing... our total bill was over $600USD for two nights. Mind you, that is without parking and no amenities aside from a keurig machine in your room. Since it is an old building, you have old-building-quirks such as SUPER thin walls. We could hear everything going on in the hall and in rooms near ours. Both mornings we were woken up by housekeeping down the hall. Although our room was clean, there was a funky smell that just wouldn't go away all weekend. Maybe they have AC in the summer but there was none during our stay in April. And finally, parking! They do have a parking lot, as shown in the photo, but parking there will cost you an extra $24 Canadian dollars per night and it is very small. 

I'm a bit of a hotel fanatic and I absolutely love a good stay. This place just didn't do it for me.",2024-04-07T21:00:37Z,67

First and foremost, I have to mention that the staff are excellent and made our stay even better! Special shoutout to Ryan who is so charismatic and helpful - we couldn't have asked for a more seamless booking, check-in and checkout experience. 

Now let's talk about the actual hotel. It almost feels as though someone took a very large house from the 1800s, upgraded everything inside, and turned it into a hotel. While this might sound weird, it's amazing! It has all the amenities of an upscale hotel (spa shower, comfortable and new bed) with the charm of an old Victorian house (exposed brick, high windows). We stayed in the Legacy King Room and absolutely loved it! One thing to note is that the hotel has no stairs which is something to keep in mind if you have troubles with steps, but the staff will gladly help carry your luggage for you so if you happen to be on floors 2/3 you'll be taken care of. 

Another thing we loved was that they also had gated parking in the back for $20 (with EV chargers as well!). Although the parking isn't covered, I did enjoy that it was gated as my car felt nice and secure in the back. 

Overall, I absolutely love this place and will definitely be returning back in the future!",2021-02-22T05:38:03Z,67

Rachel at the front desk was so nice, she even went to her car to lend me her aux cord for some music! Very kind.  
There was also another really nice woman behind the front desk, I forgot her name (I'm sorry! But she is superstitious she was telling me!) thanks a lot also! 
Only thing would be that since COVID-19 the Autoastrada restaurant is now in their parking lot and our Room 14 unfortunately was right there so it was quite loud up until 12am while the restaurant was still open.  The morning was very quiet and peaceful however.

3300,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"We booked this hotel with our American Airlines miles, it would have been $187 per night. They are located downtown and just across the street from Vancouver PD and the Salvation Army.  The location is convenient for a walk to the downtown Water Street area that is loaded with restaurants.

We arrived early and dropped our luggage off and then ventured out in the city. Came back around 3pm and did a formal check in. Our reservations were for a 2nd floor room. Seeing that the first floor is elevated by 15 steps we opted for a first floor room. Something to think about if you have a lot of luggage.....they do not have an elevator. This is a charming old style hotel.

Some rooms do not have thier own bathrooms...they share. We had a room with a nice bath/shower combo. Apparently older reviews mentioned it being hot with no air conditioning. They now have individual ac  units.

The room we had was very nice and old Victorian in decorating.  The bed was comfy and had great pillows, which is a plus by me. Very clean room with hardwood floors.

There is a continental breakfast that features crossaints, toast, cornflakes, fruit salad and coffee. We enjoyed our stay. We needed a cab to the airport and they set that up for us. It was a fun stay.",2016-08-24T02:11:28Z,67

The locations is ok, located across the street from a Salvation Army and a short walking distance to Water Street where you can catch the Hop-on/Hop-on bus and many wonderful restaurants.  I used award travel miles, so needless to say it was an extremely great value.

There is a lot to like about this hotel: convenient walking distance to Gas Town area (tip: try the Flying Pig), nice, clean and confortable rooms that come with special touches like soft bath robes, continental breakfast, overall helpful staff.

What I was not so impressed with: front desk gal who checked us in had a little bit of an attitude and actually rolled her eyes at me--big turn off.  

Tip: if you have a lot of luggage, ask for a first floor room as there is no elevator. It's not that big of a deal, but just to be aware of.

Overall, a very good value hotel.",2016-08-29T01:14:46Z,67
3302,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"This was the first and last time I'll be staying at this place. When I arrived, I had been flying all day and was super tired and just needed to rest. It was a horrible experience from the the moment I got to the door. There are no elevators or sliding/revolving doors, so I had to carry my bags up a flight of stairs to get to the entrance. Once I got to the doors, I had to wait 5 minutes in the cold for someone to open the doors because they were locked. I arrived at the ""hotel"" at 1pm. The check in agent said that I was too early and check in wasn't until 3pm. So I had no choice but to wait. The lobby didn't seem welcoming at all. The couches were very uncomfortable. While I was waiting, I called around to other hotels and the Sandman down the street had availability and they would let me check in right away. So I went back to front desk and told him that I would like to cancel my reservation because I would like to book the Sandman because they had a room for me right away. The agent then checked his computer again, then miraculously a room became available. I can't imagine this place ever selling out that there weren't rooms available to begin with. So I'm not sure why they are so set on the 3pm check in time and don't allow early check ins if rooms are available. When I was finally able to check in, he asked for a piece of ID and credit card for incidentals, which is normal. What wasn't normal was that he took a copy of my ID. In all the hotels I've stayed at, and I've stayed at a lot, only one other place took a copy of my ID and that was a shady dump similar to this place in Hong Kong. I've stayed at Marriotts, Sheratons, Hiltons, Ritz-Carltons, Holiday Inns, Sandmans, Fairmonts, etc and none of those places ever took a copy of my ID. They've asked to look at it to confirm identity but never copied it. It seems like a shady practice to copy people's ID. To get to my room, I had to go up 2 more flights of stairs carrying my suitcases because there was no elevators to the rooms either. When I got to the room, it was a pretty small room. It was about the size of the main closet in the master bedroom at my house. It wasn't a bad size but it did feel cramped at times. There was no microwave or fridge in the room. There was only 1 luggage rack, so my other bags had to go on the floor. The closet only had 3 hangers, 2 of which were used by the robes. I needed all 3, so I set the robes aside and hung my jacket, shirt and pants. The washrooms/bathrooms are shared, which isn't bad but if the previous person using it doesn't tidy up after themselves, it makes it less usable especially during COVID. But it is what it is and it is a boutique hotel after all. The hamper in the bathroom had a dead spider in it. You'd think that housekeeping would have caught that and gotten rid of it since it was the only thing in the hamper. The only upside to my stay was probably the shower. The pressure was just right and the water never got too hot or too cold. As the old saying goes, ""you get what you pay for"". I just wish this was the case here. I didn't get anywhere near what I paid for. I definitely overpaid for this place. I would not recommend.",2022-03-11T22:03:20Z,67
3303,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"This hotel was amazing! 
The staff was very friendly and helpful.
We had to stop here since our train got switched and our stay at the four seasons is the next day than when we get in.
We usually stay the Wedgewood or the four seasons, we will stay here from now on!  
Super comfortable beds and pillows.  I slept like a dream.
Amazing bathtub! 
The best bath I've ever had in my life!",2018-09-14T18:51:05Z,67
3304,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"This review is long overdue but better late than never! We chose The Victorian Hotel to host all of our out of town guests attending our wedding in May. Most of our guests (including ourselves) were traveling from abroad and we wanted a more intimate property where we could all connect. We were looking for a unique, non-chain hotel with a serious dose of character and personality. WE NAILED IT! This property was absolutely perfect for our needs.

The hotel is comprised of two attached corner block buildings from the 1800s. The hotel has been lovingly restored and updated, very much staying true to its roots and accentuating the character/original details of the building. I believe there are 48-50 rooms of varying room types. We stayed in a newly renovated corner room and it was spectacular. It was the perfect mix of Victorian and modern with big beautiful bay windows. The room translated incredibly well in our wedding photos. 

I spend half of the year sleeping in hotels for work and try to avoid chain properties whenever possible. All of the rooms are slightly different in terms of shape, decor etc and I appreciate that. There are interesting antiques around the property (tall throne chairs and a knight in shining armor) to name a few. Our bed was SO COMFORTABLE!! I judge a property on their linens and this hotel passed with flying colors. They did not skimp on quality linens!

The staff was incredibly friendly and patient with our guests (some of who didn't speak English) . After the wedding, many of the guests reached out to me to tell me how much they loved the Victorian. They all felt so comfortable there. It's like a big beautiful mansion instead of a stuffy 1000 room property.

Included in the room rate is a continental breakfast served in a modern breakfast room right next to the lobby. This was so nice for our guests as we could catch up in the morning and chat over coffee etc. A BIG THANK YOU to the staff for being so kind to us. We crowded the lobby and breakfast room for hours on end and you were all so understanding. 

Before I forget, this hotel was clean clean clean! This is obviously super important so I want to stress how impressed I was with the level of cleanliness. 

Last but not least do yourself a favor and book a reservation at Cinera, the Italian restaurant in the hotel. We did a family style rehearsal dinner there and it was outstanding. We left the menu up to the chef and I chose a red and white wine to be served upon arrival. Every single dish that we had was better than the next. I cannot wait to go back. 

The Victorian Hotel is such a breath of fresh air! I will only stay at The Victorian Hotel when I'm in Vancouver from now on. Thank you for making our wedding week so memorable!",2016-11-01T18:50:50Z,67
3305,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"Some good, some bad but and the bad was really bad but the good was very good. The location could not have been any better - within walking distance to Gastown and many other awesome cool shiznit neighborhoods.

But this is a boutique hotel to the core. The rooms provide plenty of comfort but are also extremely inconsistent, the noise level from the hall is bearable but only after a few cocktails. There is parking in back for $20 per night extended to those with cars. The price is the biggest drawing card and because of this is exactly what will bring me back. 

Just an FYI, many of the rooms do not come with a private bath, most are shared. 

Free breakfast and wifi.",2012-05-31T04:23:06Z,67
3306,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"Read explanation of scoring first:
This unique little hotel is pretty awesome I must admit, its in the middle of Gastown and is walking distance to a lot of great places. The rooms are very clean, better than name-brand hotels & competitively priced too.

 Now for the bad stuff: parking is shit (which is expected in the city) and you have to park a block down in a garage for $15 a day. I would say that the staff were pretty awesome but on the night of our stay the room next to us decided to have a hotel party- which the staff didn't attempt to stop whatsoever. Multiple calls were made to the front desk about the disturbances but to no avail. 

I loved staying here but honestly after getting no help from the staff to get the party shut down- which meant no sleep for me and the wife- I felt the 2 star rating was pretty generous.",2015-12-06T06:47:43Z,67
3307,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"I'm sure there are big and better hotels, with more amenities, but this was exactly what I was looking for and hoping for.  Reminded me of the small, quaint european hotels back in the '70s and '80s.  Lovely room, comfortable bed, nice remodeled bath and very hot water.  The view from the roof was spectacular - tried to up load my panorama photo, but it didn't work.  The hotel was close to Gastown and walking distance to any bus you might need.  Talking about buses and where to go - Michelle was knowledgable, delightful, and hysterical.  Helped us figure out what bus(es), sea bus, fare for buses, called and arranged our taxi - Michelle is a gem! 

Thank you for a wonderful stay - when I come back to Vancouver, I will stay here!",2016-06-08T04:04:36Z,67
3308,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"I don't know how or why this place has 4 stars...maybe all paid reviews? LET ME START BY SAYING: COMMUNAL BATHROOMS/SHOWERS! WaRNING! Communal. Yas. You heard me right. There's a random sink and mirror in each room, but if you want to pee, you gotta run down the hall and pray that one of the community bathrooms isn't occupied! Luckily there are about 3-4 on each floor. This place all has NO ELEVATOR! So I lugged , grudgingly, a giant 40 lb suitcase up 3 flights of rickety stairs. Also, WARNING! The freaking carpet or floor or something in each room smells like urine. Like, very strong urine smell , old urine. Had trouble falling asleep due to this. I would never ever recommend this place to anyone. Ok, one decent thing is the bed seemed clean and comfortable. That's it. Ugh.",2019-06-22T13:21:33Z,67
3309,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"Spent one night here as we were leaving on a cruise to Alaska the next day. Cab fare from the airport to hotel was about $30 and about $8 to the cruise terminal.This is a very quaint hotel that has been updated with modern, clean, comfortable  conveniences yet still retains the original flavor of the old hotel. Staff was very nice and helpful. There is no elevator so they will carry your luggage for you. There was a small breakfast included. The hotel is not too far from Gas Town and near the Cathedral of the Holy Rosary, but you have to pass the Salvation Army. There is an Italian Restaurant next door but we did not eat there.  A one night stay cost $430.00 Canadian. I found this to be expensive",2019-09-16T00:31:44Z,67
3310,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"This hotel was booked by our office staff, who are unfamiliar with Vancouver. No elevator, lots of stairs, terrible parking, the room was extremely low-class with a portable, noises a/c unit with a huge hose out the window. You need to leave the a/c running all night to block out the nighttime ""commerce"" and altercations that are right outside.

The front desk staff was not warm and welcoming and when we decided to move hotels they didn't even ask questions as to why. Just insisted that we had to be out by eleven....even though they were going to charge us an extra night because we gave them short notice.

The breakfast was in a small room with all the offerings not vegan- friendly. There was some fruit, but it was rubbery and cubed so long ago that the edges of the cubes had a shiny coating on it and cut in such ways that the offerings were not identifiable.

When your neighbouring properties are the Salvation Army, a hostel and a firm that offers ""pussy waxing"" (the company's words-not mine"", a hotel needs to go above and beyond to ensure the guests feel like they are in a safe haven. This place IS NOT that!",2017-10-01T21:17:00Z,67
3311,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"Would be possible to give 0 stars to a hotel? For me , I would classify this place as the hotel with no stars!!! This is definitely the worst hotel I have been IN MY LIFE!! ( and I travel kind of often.) This place shouldn't even be called a Hotel: it is a HOSTAL!!! As they have ""SHARED BATHROOMS"" (Only 3 bathrooms for more than 8 bedrooms; and one of the bathrooms was not even available!!); in addition to the fact that bathrooms were shared; The bathrooms were not clean at all: they were very DIRTY; which is unacceptable for me! staying here was like camping for me ( and I'm not a big fan of camping) with shared & DISGUSTING bathrooms. 

The bedroom was also super tiny; not comfortable at all. The only positive thing in this place is the location: which is not bad; but even the price was not cheap: for the quality of the service received; it was pricey. I don't think is fair to pay more than $100 for a place with shared bathrooms!! And honestly I would prefer to pay a little more and have a more decent place to stay; this hotel is a NEVER AGAIN for me! And I do not recommend anyone to ever stay there! Not even for one night!!",2017-04-20T04:18:48Z,67

AMAZING value:  perfect location near a ton of venues, Gastown restaurants/pubs, etc.  Parking is secure and well-priced, super quiet at night, comfy beds and super clean rooms/bathrooms.
Have stayed here on two separate occasions now and it will definitely continue to be my first choice whenever I am in Vancouver.",2018-03-05T04:41:38Z,67
3313,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"Pros: walking distance to Water St with pubs and bars, near subways, easy to walk to the cruise ship, access to the waterfront running/bike path. Wifi included. Clean. 

OKs: beds were fine. Breakfast included, but minimal in quality. Staff- some super friendly, others seemed put upon when asked things. 

Cons: No soap in the shower of the shared showers, just conditioner and shampoo. At times all the toilets were in use on our floor. There weren't always towels in the shared toilets.  The sink in the room didn't hold water and had no plug. 

Our personal trouble with this hotel  is that we had booked a room with three beds and a toilet in the room 7 months in advance. Three days prior to our arrival, we get an email saying ""sad news"" that the renovations which had begun on that room in March were still not done, so we were to stay in a room with two double beds and a bath down the hall. I won't go in to the details, but the result was 4 adults with 4 substantial suitcases, with no floor space and a lot of hassle. 

Would not stay here again. It's pros are generic and there must be other boutique hotels in the area.",2015-06-20T16:24:34Z,67

3315,Victorian Hotel,3.9,This hotel is still under construction. I think it will be nice when it is finished. Although it does not sit in a great area to be walking around at night. The breakfast included is a nice touch. We received a discount since maintenance was scheduled to fix the TV between 9 to 11 on Sunday morning. This paired with there being no curtain in our room's bathroom lead us to check out early.

3317,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"This hotel is SO bad. Not sure where to start. WAY overpriced. They offer nothing for sale...no water, soda, snacks, etc. 'Breakfast"" is coffee, tea, and pastries. WiFi is a joke. The front desk girls are rude and snotty. For $250/night this place should be catering to their guests. There should be a complimentary bottle of water, there should be a mini fridge, there should be at least one vending machine, etc. Staff should be polite and helpful. Breakfast should be breakfast - it should include juices for people who don't/can't drink coffee. You get absolutely nothing with the room except a bed...oh and tap water. Oh and their listing claims they have a restaurant in the hotel - nope, no restaurant. There is an Italian restaurant in the same building but they have a dress code. So it's not like we can just run over there and buy some water and a quick meal in our vacation clothes. We travel a lot, and we've never been so disappointed!",2019-05-25T03:27:46Z,67

We reserved a ""superior"" room which means in-room bathroom; it had two double beds.  Parking was up the street in a car park for a fee.  Breakfast was bread, fruit, coffee, tea and milk - just enough to shake out the cobwebs.

We chose a room with a shared bathroom and found the facilities clean and nicely finished. The building has been beautifully restored and the rooms benefit from comfortable beds and period furnishings. We had a real sense of enjoying easy elegance in a classically appointed building. The breakfast provided was simple but satisfying with enough variety to make it substantial enough for a day of sightseeing. The hotel is very conveniently located with Gastown just steps away. We will look forward to returning!",2017-02-23T00:14:16Z,67
3323,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"Lovely!  The location is great--very convenient to the seabus and skytrain, on the edge of Gastown and close enough to walk (30 minutes) to Stanley Park.  The neighborhood can get a little rowdy late night on the weekends, but it didn't feel unsafe.  If you have a window looking out onto the street, be prepared for some raucousness while you're trying to sleep.

Rates seemed very reasonable--though $10 more than listed on the website.  For 110-129 CND, you could get a room with a double bed or a slightly larger room with a king bed.  Rooms aren't spacious, but are nicely appointed with real antique furniture, comfy bed, and clean sheets and a warm duvet.  They won't look as nice as the website pictures especially in terms of space, but I was pleased.  The in room sink is useful, since we did shared bathrooms.  However, there were two full shared baths on our floor plus several with half baths, and I don't think I ever had to wait in line to shower.  All rooms come with cozy robes, nice towels, and soap and lotion.  The showers are equipped with decent shampoo, and conditioner on the thin side.

The staff were very helpful, and there are big maps at reception that you can take.  The continental breakfast includes bread, croissants, cereal, yogurt, and awesomely fresh big blueberries.  The bread and croissants are pretty meh, but the blueberries are worth making a first breakfast out of.  A second great perk is that the rooms have free wifi (really slow though), BUT there were two shared computers on our floor that anyone could use and there's even free printing!",2011-09-13T18:20:47Z,67

3326,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"We stayed at the Victorian Hotel the weekend of the BMO Vancouver Marathon. By the time I made reservations, no hotels in the area had rooms on the Saturday night before the marathon. The Victorian was the closest hotel with rooms. Located within walking distance of Roger's Arena, the Victorian Hotel was close enough to walk to the start and from the finish of the marathon.

My family of 2 adults and 2 children was called ""large"" by the front desk. There is a hostel portion of the hotel, with shared bathing facilities. There is also a more ""American"" style portion of the hotel, with en suite bathing facilities. Our room was a 2 double bed room with a television, desk, and closet, as well as, a sitting area for two which included an oddly shaped plastic chair that was super-comfortable, especially for my poor 13.1 mile run feet.

A continental breakfast was served in the morning. It is a truly continental breakfast - coffee, fruit, bagels, etc. It was great for a start for the day.

We also paid for parking in the gated lot behind the hotel. Parking elsewhere would have cost as much money, so we were happy for the secure location. However, the parking was so tight and full, that we parked our car in a spot and left it there the entire weekend. We took the bus or walked every where we went.

Wi-fi was available for free.

Unfortunately, the night before the marathon, the Canucks played, and lost. It was noisy outside. There was heat in the room, but to have cool air, the windows had to be opened.

The beds were quite comfy. Overall, I recommend the Victorian Hotel to those looking to stay in the area. Be sure to clarify if you want a hostel-style room or ""American""-style room. We'd stay there again.",2011-07-01T03:22:14Z,67
3327,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"This is a solid hotel in a great location with reasonable rates for the area. The rooms are comfortable and warm, and there's a basic breakfast downstairs in the morning. If I could give 3.5 stars I would, but no se puede, and there were a few quirks to our stay that make me lean towards the 3 mark. Here goes:

- Lots of noise. The basement was being renovated while we were there and there was constant jackhammering during the day. It's also pretty easy to hear the hallway and adjacent rooms, especially if there's a band of Chihuahua-voiced sorority girls shrieking into the night.
- One of the rooms was missing a tub mat, and my poor mom actually and slipped and bumped her head during a shower. No good.
- Broken toilet handle that fell off with every use
- Broken ringer on one of the phones, so no room-to-room calling.
- This one's superficial but -- the lighting in my room was super bright and fluorescent with no lower setting available. A dimmer switch would have made the room a lot more nicer to be in.

We voiced our gripes to the front desk on checking out and the response was kind of... ""aw shucks"". Not rude, but they could have offered more of an apology or preferably reduced the bill a smidgen.

So all in all, if you don't mind putting up with some noise and occasional amenity failure, this isn't a bad option by any means. You'll be right in the thick of Downtown Van, which is probably more important than sitting in a hotel room anyway.",2012-12-17T02:31:35Z,67

As for the hotel itself, super charming! We had a deluxe room, while a little small it's what we expected for a historic building and it was plenty of room for 2. Bathroom is remodeled to a nice modern clean style and it had iron, hair dryer and a perfect little coffee pot! 
We knew going in that the hotel had no central AC but we were pleasantly surprised to find a great little portable unit in the room since it's been quite hot up here lately!!' Super awesome touch on the part of hotel management!

The complimentary breakfast was adequate, with cereal, fresh blueberries, various fresh breads and good coffee.  The place is clean and pleasantly decorated.  A good value if you are not willing or able to pay for a hotel in a more upscale part of the city.  Free wifi.

Cons:  Our first floor room overlooked the small parking lot in the rear. I was awakened one morning at 7:00am by the jarring sound of trash trucks doing their business.  The next night I was awakened by loud talking in the parking lot at 3:00am.  The breakfast room was small and cannot always accommodate all guests.  There was no juice available.

You do need to have a certain expectation when booking, like knowing the age of the building and being comfortable with the location etc.. it can be noisy with the window open but that's most places.

3335,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"With the name, ""Victorian Hotel,"" one might assume a very historic and charming hotel full of character and elegance. Unfortunately, this one *is* of 'character' - of an old and uncharming kind. 

We found this hotel via Fodor's - which will be last time I'm going to book a hotel based on their recommendation. We paid $119/night for our rooms (despite the posted rack rate of $109/night) - but upon entering our hotel room, I immediately asked if I could get a refund because:

- Throughout the hotel, there was a strong unpleasant smell (I'm assuming it was coming from the drainages of the sinks within each of the guest rooms),
- The hotel carpet was badly worn, 
- The front desk receptionist was cold and unwelcoming, 
- Our original room was TINY - barely fitting two double beds, had no AC - just a fan that was barely circulating the air, white comforters/sheets that were no longer white, and a window without a window (yes, I kid you not, our room was missing its window!). 

Given all of these items were noted within 5 minutes of us checking in, I'd assume that the receptionist would understand why we would want a refund. But alas, she made it very clear that there were NO refunds allowed...so she gave us another room, this time with a king size bed - which was better than the old room, but still not worth the price we paid.

The hotel badly need some TLC - i.e., upgrades and attention to detail. The hotel had very worn, second hand, odd mix-match of furniture. Breakfast was horrendous - 3-day old, stale chocolate croissants, plates that looked dirty, and costco size open containers of yogurt, jam, etc. - unappetizing and unsanitary. The common bathroom never seem to have enough clean hand towels, floors were consistently wet, and bathroom products that were cheap (be prepared to make one bathroom soap last throughout your stay.) They dont even have a standard 'do not disturb sign' - which I had to make on my own. It's conveniently located across the salvation army and by the edge of the bad part of town - making homeless folks a common sight (just outside your window). The place is unkept - grime surrounding the bathroom fixtures, thrash underneath the bed from the previous hotel guest, and dust on the fixtures.

The whole experience was more similar to staying to a hostel than a hotel. A stay at a Holiday Inn or other motel would be better than this. For $50 more, you could book a nice stay at a Westin/others - it'd be better than this place in terms of value. Wish I did stay somewhere else as our stay here soured our whole Vancouver trip.",2012-08-09T00:41:18Z,67
3336,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"We recently stayed at the Victorian hotel. Their prices are very different than what they stated online and the room was incredibly and uncomfortably small. Before, we had stayed at a place called the Buchmann hotel which had considerably better accomidations. I suppose we were expecting a step up with the Victorian Hotel because of the higher rate. The staff was not helpful at all. We felt like they could care less about what we thought (even though we didn't rudely complain- which perhaps we should have). The one and only thing that was good about this hotel was the free breaktfast. Otherwise, we will never see the place again. Thank goodness! If you are looking for something comfortable and geared for customer service, this is not the place for you!",2012-08-09T02:36:14Z,67
3337,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"This is a charming and reasonably-priced hotel in Vancouver. A bit noisy in the morning - someone at the garbage bins in the alley at 7am - but the room was large, bed extremely comfortable, and bathroom modern. Breakfast was good - I nearly missed the fruit salad arriving at 8am - loved the fresh croissants. Reluctant in a way to post a review because this is a quaint find in an expensive city.",2017-06-09T21:37:42Z,67
3338,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"Cute charming boutique hotel.  Friendly staff and very clean accommodations.  I would say recently remodeled since many of the bathrooms seemed almost new actually.  I think prices vary a lot by time of the year, but regardless this place was well worth what I paid. I felt comfortable walking around at night and the location seemed good for everything.  I had a car rental so the parking around back was perfect and easily accessible for a small fee of $15 per night.  I booked late for a business trip and many of the bigger hotels were booked up and I was very happy that I landed at the Victorian Hotel.",2010-07-05T19:17:52Z,67

The building is beautiful, the rooms are charming and comfortable and I truly can not say enough great thing about the staff all the way from the desk clerks to the housekeeping team. They were all warm, personable, fun and friendly. I honestly never wanted to leave.",2014-11-06T02:57:07Z,67
3340,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"The Victorian Hotel is such a great find and one of the best values for your money in Vancouver!  The rooms and bathrooms are spotless.  The staff have always been very friendly whenever I have stayed there.  Nice hardwood floors and the rooms (and the hotel itself) have great character (understatedly elegant and very well-maintained).  If you choose to book a room with a shared bathroom down the hall, there was hardly ever a wait-- perhaps just a few minutes at most in the morning.  Before I first stayed here, I was a bit worried about reviews on some other sites which questioned the safety of the neighborhood.  It's really fine and I felt safe enough, even at night.  (But, it does border on a sketchier neighborhood a few blocks to the east.)  The Victorian Hotel is a great find and it's my home in Vancouver!",2010-09-17T12:00:46Z,67
3341,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"The Victorian Hotel is a no brainer. Especially if you are in Vancouver to have fun and want something centrally located.  The staff really is very friendly.  I can't stress this enough. Also, the building itself is great!  It is far more interesting than staying in a chain hotel. 

My advice is not to get one of the budget rooms. My wife and I originally booked one and were not happy at all. It had a bad internet connection, felt cramped, and was kind of dumpy. We talked to the staff got upgraded to a larger room with a private bathroom. It really made all the difference, including a faster wifi connection. 

I would stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to a friend.",2011-09-30T14:43:44Z,67
3342,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"Just finished staying at the VH for three nights.  Really liked the room (which was in the new annex).  The room had all the amenities that I care about -- robes, comfortable bed, good linens, spacious -- and none that I don't care about.  The continental breakfast was pretty basic but sufficient.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

The location of the hotel is ideal, just a stone's throw from Gastown and Downtown.  A reasonably short walk to Yaletown.  Perfect.

So why only 4 stars?  Two reasons: my room was a little loud.  It looked out over the stairs to the parking lot and I could hear people going up and down.  Same noise complaint from the hallway.  It was never excessive but there was noise.  Second, I think the original part of the hotel is undergoing renovation and so there was some evidence of construction.  I expect that will end soon and I can upgrade my review.

I would definitely recommend the hotel to a friend.",2012-11-19T05:39:52Z,67

Nice rooms, comfy beds, good location. What more could you want?",2011-01-27T16:36:40Z,67
3344,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"I stayed here with my partner while I was attending a conference. The location was great--I was able to walk to my conference in the morning with no trouble, and it's a short walk from china town and gastown. It's one street over from a really bad area, though, so be aware. The coffee shop across the street was awesome. Hotel staff was friendly. One of our keys didn't work the first day, so they made a copy within a couple hours. The maid service was thorough. The dining area was too small for everyone, unless you got up really early. Also, if you don't get up before 9, you don't get a hot shower. The thing that really got me, though, was that I payed extra for a private bathroom, but the website failed to mention that it was not connected to the room. We still had to put on our robes and go across the hall to get to it. Also, the bullet proof glass in the stairwell is pretty creepy, and all in all the building is pretty old and run down. Two things to b aware of: there is no elevator, and even though they lock the front door, they keep the side entrance open and unwatched for easy smoke break access. Perks? The bed was comfortable and the windows REALLY blocked out the noise.",2012-09-29T15:29:07Z,67
3345,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"Really nice spot. Close to all the good places to visit. Great breakfast. Warm and toasty in the winter. Friendly staff. The rates are great. The only improvement I would add is better internet. It just doesn't reach to all of the nooks and crannies in the hotel and if your room happens to be in one of those nooks, you don't have internet . . . AT ALL. I spent a lot of time in the stairwell . . .",2014-11-13T05:41:16Z,67
3346,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"Charming historical building which provided great location to walk to Gastown, Canada Place, and China Town. (If u have a lot of luggage, take a taxi). Very comfortable beds and bedding. Nice big room with king size bed or 2 double beds and private bath shower with marble tiling. Great water pressure and plenty hot water. Lovely smelling lotion, shampoos, and conditioner.  Note not all rooms have private bathrooms. Loved all the wood floors. Adequate continental breakfast. Nothing special. Staff very friendly and helpful. Wifi worked great. More reasonable than Marriott yet bedding was as nice and Marriott doesn't have the charm. What might be missing is location although great is a bit shoddy,  loudness and coolness factors as must leave windows open as no a/c, privacy on ground floor due to above note, and few building construction details that have not been finished or overlooked like exposed insulation in hallway. Would definitely stay there again as the positives far outweigh the negatives.",2013-09-16T17:43:10Z,67

3349,Victorian Hotel,3.9,"My wife and I stayed in a bedroom with a king bed with a private bathroom for six days the first week of October. The weather was perfect this week so the absence of air conditioning was not an issue. I didn't notice any renovation in progress as noted by other guests, but recommended that they reinvest a little in having someone check the bathroom fixtures to ensure that screws are present and tight, and that the sink in the room drains properly, as these minor annoyance was the only negative things I can think to say and are easily fixed. The main features of this hotel for us were the charming nature of the staff and the building, and its extremely convenient location. Everything worked well and we didn't lack for anything. We would probably choose to stay there again if we needed to be situated in that location. With regard to safety on the street, we felt very safe given that we were aware of the less safe area directly southeast. In fact, a sense of gentleness was the most prominent feature of that area of Vancouver for us.",2012-10-08T20:47:53Z,67
3350,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"This is a very nice hotel on Robson in the West End, clean and elegantly designed, friendly and helpful staff, but surprisingly down to Earth for a hotel this nice.

Rooms are above 1st floor and offset from Robson, closer to the nearby alley road, which is quieter. But in general Robson and nearby adjacent Jervis don't tend to get too loud at night. There's a ton of dining options up and down Robson, as well as their associate restaurants attached to the hotel (Forage and Jervis Joint).

One note: The rooms have a fridge but no microwave, plus some rooms have a shower but no tub in bathroom (to their credit, many of the nicer hotels also don't guarantee a tub). If a bath tub is important, be sure to ask for a room with one. And given most people stay here to be near so many restaurants, you might not want a microwave anyway!

Fixtures are fairly new and well designed. The A/C always works great, and the windows do crack open if you want outdoor air.

The hotel's uphill from a lot of the West End action on Denman as well as from the Waterfront and Stanley Park, so be ready for a hike if you want to head that way (as well as an uphill hike back!). They're a few blocks west of the City Centre Skytrain station on Georgia/Granville and it can be a bit of an adventure to get to/from there on foot during midday.

Overall, it's a great and well-kept hotel, certainly my top choice whenever I come back to Vancouver.",2023-06-21T19:19:08Z,133

We love the art work around the hotel, so tasteful and unique.  The location is excellent as well, quiet and close to public transport & walking distance to great restaurants.

The hotel itself does not appear that big, and it's a valet only parking that will cost about $50USD.  Hotel doesn't have a swimming pool, but it has something I haven't seen at other hotels before, a filtered water system with not only cold water, but dispenses sparkling water!   There was a free wine tasting on the day we arrived (but the wine we liked we couldn't find them in any of their local liquor stores) and lots of art décor throughout the hotel.  

We paid about $400 a night with taxes and fees plus valet parking, which was pretty decent considering the location.",2022-07-27T00:26:45Z,133

3356,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"First hotel on a Collette tour of a railroad trip through the Canadian Rockies.  Originally scheduled to stay at Westin Bayshore, with an ocean view.  

Got there midafternoon.  Modern 5 story hotel right on the tourist downtown section of Vancouver.  Small Lobby, but large conference rooms and next door restaurant.  Open and airy with lots of glass windows floor to ceiling in the lobby area.

Need an electronic key card to operate the elevator. We are the first in our party of 30 to check in, and get the 2nd floor corner room, over the parking entrance area below.  Face back road area fronted by large condominium towers.  

Very spiffy looking hotel room, with queen bed, glass covered desk, side desks, coffee table, chairs, dresser, electronic safe, strong AC -yes you need AC in Canada!

Plenty of lamps, no microwave, no refrigerator.  Bathroom with deep wide bathtub, tight fit between the bathroom door and toilet, with sink and vanity mirror outside the bathroom.

Firm comfortable queen bed, with fluffy pillows.  

5pm wine tasting in lobby, except that I don't drink.  Strong continuous free wifi signal. 

Quiet area, except for the rooms directly above the dumpster, which is emptied periodicallty early in the morning by noisy dump truck. 

Lack of multi prong electrical outlets next to coffee table and desk, with 40"" flat screen TV above.   

Nice ambiance, attractive wallpaper, decent clean rugs, and restaurants everywhere nearby.  A bit of a walk to the harbor area, view blocked by high rises nearby.  If you are looking for an ocean view, you've come to the wrong hotel!",2017-09-01T16:26:07Z,133

They have apple cider all day in the lobby which was great and they also do free wine tasting in the evening. The staff were very friendly and nice. Room was decent sized, our room was facing Robson St and we could also see the waterfront from our window.

They left a small Christmas package for those that stayed here on Christmas eve which I felt was a nice touch. 

The key card wasn't working well and we ended up reconfiguring our card almost every day. They are totally green hotel which means even the toilet paper is ecofriendly. They did not have a body lotion in the room which seemed odd but not a big deal.",2018-01-16T03:48:35Z,133

3359,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Omg whatever you do DO NOT get duped into thinking this is a luxury, hip or even art-deco hotel. This is a rundown, old, completely outdated hotel with some fake art strewn about. Not sure where to begin ... but spend your $$ elsewhere

-The bathroom is reflective of a Days Inn or Motel 6.  (See photos) literally 
-The shower gel literally smells of urine with hints of fake lemon
-Room decor is so grossly outdated they're actually trying to convince you it's hip ... do not buy it. 
-They say it's ""eco friendly"" which means they give you extra hard abrasive Kleenex and tissue paper
-Zero amenities in room (you have to walk down hall for a shared water well ... again nothing hip about that) ... or there's a shoe shine the size of a Lego
-Furniture is cheap pine with huge dings, gashes ... again nothing fools you into believing it's vintage or retro
-Carpet smells

If you have to stay here, dear god get yourself drunk next door OR go to the local drugstore and overdose on sleeping pills.

The staff are friendly.  It's not luxurious (the rooms are spartan), but it's clean and well maintained.  I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4 because it doesn't have all the little luxuries that make a 4 star hotel.

My only complaint - when I stayed there on a weekend housekeeping started knocking on doors to see if rooms were ready to be cleaned at EIGHT AM on a SUNDAY!!",2010-07-05T15:24:42Z,133
3361,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"The Listel was the BEST hotel experience I've had in a long time. The staff there is amazingly friendly and accommodating. There were no bedbugs O_o whoever wrote that was crazy. 

You get free french press coffee delivered in the morning, not the sad in-room coffee maker coffee (but that's an option too if you're jonesing). 

The restaurant is DELICIOUS and all locally sourced/seasonal. The room service was also extremely helpful and they even went out of their way for a special birthday breakfast. 

We had the bed, books, and breakfast package which meant a great book with short stories about Vancouver from Canadian authors (including William Gibson!!) and any breakfast from Forage (excellent Benedicts).

Marinho at the front desk was so helpful and extremely professional. They really go the extra mile for all of their guests.

There isn't any TV for free, but there's wifi and internet connections and so much great art, why would you want to waste time staring at the TV?

I love the west end and it was perfectly placed on Robson, but nice and quiet, not too far from the sky train stop.

3363,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Really, 3.5 stars, but I decided to round up.

The Listel Hotel was a good deal for our 2 room suite ($199.00 plus $24.00 for parking).  I booked directly with the hotel.  The upside: the bathrooms were contemporary with beautiful modern fixtures, big closet, complementary  french press coffee delivered to our room each morning, farewell cookies in our car when it was brought up upon our departure, friendly staff, roomy suite.  Downside:  the light carpet and light upholstery need to be cleaned or replaced; some of the furniture has seen better days, view of dim sum restaurant and top of roof.  I didn't like the duvet  -- it didn't look to have the type of cover that can be laundered so I wasn't sure how clean it was.  I read somewhere that bedspreads and remote controls are the dirtiest things in hotel rooms so I usually throw the bedspread off the bed immediately, but since the duvet served as the only warmth (just a sheet otherwise), I couldn't do that.  I like hotels where you know they've laundered the duvet cover or they encase the blanket in a clean sheet.  All and all a good stay.",2009-06-21T07:10:44Z,133
3364,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Unfortunatley the negatives outweigh the positives.

Neg-

Long strands of hair on drying off towels, almost everyday of housekeeping changing the towels.
Hair in the ice bucket, and very dirty ice bucket. 
Nasty stain on the sheets
Red splatter on the inner part of the duvet cover, the part where you would have touching the shoulder while you sleep
A long strand of hair on the duvet cover, which did not match my hair color
Called valet 5 min prior to leaving, our car was NOT waiting for us. We had to wait 10 min until figuring out no one called for our car to valet. This happened 2 days in a row. This was my only complaint to the front desk. Strawberries were waiting for us when we arrived.

Beware of booking thru travel sites. If you booked a stanadard room, you get standard service, which is slim to none. We tried to park our car and were told it was valet ONLY. So we assumed we tip the valet for parking. Well little did we know we were getting jipped $19/day for parking. So we were charged dbl for parking. 

Front Desk needs a little adjustment with the way they treat guests. We werent treated badly at all, we werent treated they way you are suppose to be treated staying at a facility paying that much money. No one offered to carry our bags to the car when we left. Instead we were slapped with a fat bill underneath the door prior to checkout, we woke up and that bill was the first things we saw. All they want is money, they will not go the extra mile to make sure you feel welcomed. 

I felt as if I were staying at a Motel6. If I had to rate this hotel it would not be above 2/3 stars. I see nothing to rant or rave about. Unfortunatley Hotwire picks the hotel you stay at after you pay, I will book directly with a hotel next time. I would refer going to the Fairmont Waterfront or Renassiance. I stayed at renassiance years ago and it was superb. Paid $400 for the room, but well worth it. Sometimes depending on the hotels you book with good deals does not mean you will get what you pay for. Not at this hotel atleast.

This whole time I did not complain once, only about the car.",2008-09-18T15:59:41Z,133
3365,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"We got a great deal at the Listel through the Vancouver tourism site where we got a $125 gift card to Vancouver attractions (watch out, that $125 doesn't get you very far!) if we spent two nights there.  Even before that, though, the rate was good.  We were also pleasantly surprised that we received breakfast vouchers for the hotel restaurant, O'Doul's, which is not the Irish pub it sounds like but in fact a really nice restaurant.  The breakfasts there were delicious and very filling!  We also had a drink there one evening and they have a great local beer and wine selection.

The rooms were also really nice - spacious and modern.  I think we stayed on a gallery floor, but there is original artwork throughout the hotel and it was really lovely.  The room came equipped with everything we needed.  Also, they have a daily wine reception in the evening, in which we discovered a really nice British Columbia wine, which we then went out and a bottle of because we enjoyed it so much.

The staff was also great - providing us with restaurant recommendations, and even writing down the name of the wine and suggesting a store in which to buy it.  They also stored our luggage on our travel day, which was nice.  Oh, also, free wi-fi is great!",2011-06-22T02:51:49Z,133

3367,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Listel is not a bad hotel over all -- it's just pros and con and the fact that I booked online where it was listed as a 4-Star hotel at a 4-Star price. 

Make no mistake -- IT IS NOT A 4-STAR HOTEL by any stretch of the imagination.

GREAT staff, NICE location, comfortable enough beds (I like firm), decent rooms, and I actually LOVED the slightly dim hallways -- but:
#1: the free wifi experience felt like getting thrown back the 1986 on a 9.6 baud dial-up. Seriously -- you get kicked off constantly and it took 10~20 minutes to send or receive even the smallest email message. Tech support even told me that I should stand closer to the door -- that actually worked ""a little better"" but I shouldn't have to do that and it's NOT a 4-star solution!
#2: The bath tub was covered with some kind of hardened cement or glue -- no way to comfortably take a bath.
#3: The hot water was inconsistent during showers -- and my pet-peeve: the shower head comes out of the wall at the height of my chest. If you're over 5'7"" you'll have to do the limbo to rinse.
#4 and all the rest: No way to get a cup of coffee in the morning outside the $15 breakfast. (Ran to the coffee shop in the rain.) No flat screen?! (Couldn't connect the laptop to it.) 4-Star housekeeping staff will reset the alarm clock at check-out so it doesn't go off at 5:30am for the next guest. Stained furniture.

If they lop $30 off the price and call it a 3-Star hotel, I'd actually add at least one star to my rating...",2012-10-22T04:57:38Z,133
3368,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"When I read the reviews for this hotel I wonder whether they can be describing the same place I'm staying in at the moment: the Listel Hotel in Vancouver BC.  I'm not in the habit of giving bad reviews, but I simply couldn't let all the glowing reviews stand w/o commenting.  

First, the positives:
.Friendly, helpful, efficient front desk
.Central (though not particularly attractive) location
.they tried with the furniture (though the wood is scratched and weary)
.screened prints with indigenous designs
.extra-deep tub
.decent towels
.wine in the lobby for an hour in the evening 
.cool concept
.quiet hallway
.attempt at being green
.free (but slow) wifi
.free phone calls to states

Now, the rest:
.after reading the reviews here and in trip advisor I felt shocked when I arrived at a broken down looking 1980's hotel with what appears to be public housing in the back.
.booked a room on the museum floor and can't imagine what they mean by museum aside from a couple of indigenous-themed screened prints.
.closet door broken
.no in-room safe
.tv not flat-screened and no printed guide
.view from our window of the back alley facing the projects 
.a wad of someone's already-chewed gum in the drawer
.extra-hard bed that sags in the middle, like it's been used for the last 25 years - so bad that we wake up multiple times per night in pain.
.not enough pillows and the ones we have are lumpy and under-filled
.no continental (or any other kind) of breakfast
.running toilet
.shower head keeps falling off
.our whole room - and indeed, the whole hotel - feels TIRED and as if they took a broken-down hotel, gave it the barest whiff of a remodel, slapped on a concept, and called it a boutique hotel.  It looks not even CLOSE to the pics on the travel sites.
.though location is in walking distance to downtown, it's not particularly attractive and in spite of some decent shops it feels a bit seedy.

In short, my husband and I booked this hotel for our 10th anniversary, thinking it would be special.  We felt deeply disappointed as we arrived, because it's not even close to what we pictured and read about in the reviews.  I'd say an appropriate price for our room would be about $80/night, and I wouldn't dream of staying here again unless I could get a room for about that much.

As a comparison: the night before I arrived I stayed in a Best Western hotel in Seattle that was about the same vintage.  However, we had an extra-large room, an extremely comfortable bed with wonderful linens and excellent pillows, four pillows per bed, flat-screen tv w/guide, full breakfast, everything in perfect working order -- and we paid half of what we paid for our room at the Listel.  Will update this later in our stay if our experience improves.  For now: I feel duped.",2011-07-26T15:07:29Z,133
3369,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"I really liked this place  It was clean and comfortable, and a great location.  I loved the artwork in the rooms and halls so much, I bought a piece.  I think this is a great concept, that really benefits local artists.  More hotels should consider this instead of the cheap manufactured crap.
The hotel is only a few blocks from the water, and walking distance to shopping, great food, and Stanley Park.
My only complaint is the valet driver.  You could hear him screeching the tires in the back lot, and was whipping around the corners way too fast.  Otherwise, a positive experience.",2014-09-23T20:33:49Z,133
3370,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Cozy boutique hotel is a repeat time and time again!

This is a quiet clean funky boutique hotel centrally located on trendy Robson Street in Vancouver.

Food is great, staff is friendly and helpful and the price is great.

I really enjoy the fact they are very environmentally conscious with built in dispensers for shower gel, shampoo and conditioner and they have recycling facility's and blue boxes in the room!

This ( along with the big comfy beds ) makes it an A+ for me",2011-05-08T01:21:03Z,133
3371,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"This hotel was very convenient to the western section of Vancouver and is about 7 - 8 blocks from Stanley Park.  The entire area is very walk-able, whether you want to explore Sunset Beach, stroll along the harbor, etc.  The neighborhood is full of restaurants (including many ramen shops, to the delight of at least one member of our group), again all within an easy walk.

The staff was always cheerful, helpful, and available.  The room was clean and quiet; no complaints there.  The view facing south was just of large apartment buildings.  They offer a complimentary glass of wine for an hour (I managed to miss it on our 2nd night by 5 minutes at both ends).  Parking is valet-only, which isn't my preference.  However, they made it pretty convenient (and I understand why self-parking isn't an option in such a dense area).  

Room rates were competitive or better when we stayed, though not 'budget'.  They had WiFi included, but no complimentary breakfast (other places nearby which did offer the free breakfast were significantly higher in price - more than for breakfast for 3, at least).  

I have nothing to compare it to directly (as we only stayed here, for the 2 nights) but I'd recommend it for a first-time in Vancouver.",2016-08-31T23:55:31Z,133
3372,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Starting with the many positives, the hotel is in an excellent location with great access to shopping, parks, and every day amenities like Starbucks and Whole Foods. The room was clean and pleasant with a large window. The room was so quiet I could hear a pin drop. Also, the ac worked well and also was quiet.

Unfortunately I can only give it 3 stars because of my own comfort while sleeping.  I'm aware that not everyone is such a sensitive sleeper, but for me, the fact that the mattress made me feel like I was sinking a bit towards the center was a huge drawback and impediment to good sleep. (Perhaps others might find the mattress comfortable,  but if you prefer a firmer mattress, I think you could have problems.) 

The other issue that made me not sleep well was all the light that came in from gaps in the (older style) vinyl curtains.  They are light blocking type curtains,  but there is no valence at the top or the sides, so there are so many gaps that the room has quite a bit of light by 6:30 am.  If morning light doesn't bother you, then you might not even notice this older-curtain issue.

The customer service was fine at this hotel and over all I think it's good value.",2016-08-27T07:24:31Z,133
3373,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"For Robson St shopper or Downtown or Stanley Park visitors, this maybe a five star hotel for you. 
For me, it is an okay. 

Pros:
-Located at end of Robson closer to Stanley Park.  -This part of the street is also a food street with many different kind of cuisines. 
-Hotel service is with details. The complementary in room French Press coffee and tea service is very much appreciated even the coffee is a bit on the weaker side per my liking. But hey, it is complementary and I can see it created much more work for the staff with this nice gesture. With a little note from the night before, I received exactly what I ordered on time. Double thumbs up!
-Valet parking is about $30CAD/day. Valet service is quick and very friendly. There is a garage nearby that is about $10 cheaper. To me, I don't think it's worth my safety (overall is safe but with a few more drinks good people will turn too) to walk to/from at night. It's downtown parking, $30 is not that outrageous. 
-Free wifi
-The little window couch area is cute in each room. 
-Decent update TV and room has plenty of power and USB outlets. 

Cons:
-Checked in Saturday night and found a group of happy nighters on the same floor. The door slamming and loud talking outside the hallway took place all night long. 
-The beds are not too comfortable. I can feel the springs in my bed.  That's why I was very happy to woke up by the coffee scent. 
-It's Downtown. I know. The bathroom is tiny but sufficient to conduct the normal business. Just FYI
-The AC Heating unit is a little slow to mange the temperature change and it is loud. The most annoyingly part is the machine makes a significant sound whenever it reached a breaking point/cycle all night long. It was snowing outside, I have to keep the heat running. 
-The water pressure and temperature is not strong enough for my liking. After a long day of walking around town, a hot shower is much needed.",2018-02-20T05:02:18Z,133
3374,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"The front desk staff are awesome. We were 1st time visitors to Vancouver and they were very paitent answering our many questions, getting cabs, etc. There is complimentary wine from 5 to 6 each evening. The room was very spacious except for the sink area. Very difficult for 2 females to get dressed at same time. Most attractions that we wanted to see were not close to the hotel and since they did not have a shuttle, we had to taxi everywhere. Each floor has a fountain offering cold filtered water...flat or sparkling. Really enjoyed this feature. Though we did not take advantage of it, the hotel also has complimentary bicycles for their guests and umbrellas. We would stay here again.",2018-09-09T18:21:08Z,133
3375,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Came here for a weekend with friends and this hotel was perfect for our stay. I recommend this place if you are visiting Vancouver. 

Location: Great location. Short walk to Stanley Park. Located on Robson street where there is shopping and many food, tea shop, dessert options. Short drive to Granville Island.

Other things I loved about the hotel. 

- Green hotel: I love they strive to be a green hotel
- Chilled water dispensers on every floor. Loved having the ability to get water throughout the weekend
- Free delivered coffee in the AM. You just had to complete the order card and hang it outside your door the night before. 

Staff: Nice and pleasant

Parking: $40 per night",2019-11-10T03:03:12Z,133
3376,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Having finally returned to Vancouver after over 3 years, I engaged my travel bug and sought after another unique place that wasn't too touristy, hopefully, and yet not too small to omit amenities I enjoy having while traveling - which brought me to Listel.

The Process: Check-in and out was good. The gal, Ayumi(?), was friendly and composed while setting me up for a room I think on the 5th or 6th FL. Getting ready to leave, they were happy to tag your luggage for storage past check-out that day until you're ready to fly out, or catch a train or drive home, etc. They also indicated you could retain access to the on-site facilities, just not the room (for example: use the computer, the fitness center, etc).

The Room: Pretty comfortable! I think the heating design is a bit lacking. In other places, upper 60's was plenty to keep me warm with regular operation. I kept increasing this one to the low-mid 70's and that was decent. Heat rises, so the vents already being near the ceiling didn't really help... One vent's fins could bend down but still doesn't seem worth it. Climate control can improve. The bed was cozy; nice feel and good height. The kitchenette items were nice. I just used the nifty electric water heater. The bathroom was nice, if a bit cramped navigating the toilet door. The shower uses bulk dispensers; thumbs up for being green here. I hate the cute little toiletries that places use; those are easy targets for the landfill after even tiny use. If you have leftover food you'd like to heat up, you can rent a microwave (a new silly idea to me); I think like 10 bucks / night or something like that. Great TV channels. The door stop brake could be stronger for less slamming. Laundry pickup is a bit pricey per article of clothing.

The Facility: A very decent place that appears modestly renovated from it's old origins. The business center computer is in a tight corner nearby the front desk. Parking is valet only; can be an issue if you just need to run up to your room (or perhaps just curb park at a meter). The fitness center is a good above-average. The locker rooms and main floor appear stocked and diverse. It has a neat subterranean feel being down a staircase with dark wood finishes and mirrors - sort of located ""down & away""; not sure handicap accessible unless via emergency exit. A TV is available. It was good except it was damn cold; it must've been me since another guest was sweating up a storm. The Wi-Fi was good, if a bit spotty in spots between the lobby and rooms.

The Staff: Overall, friendly and helpful.

Closing thoughts: Positive experience, overall. The location was rather very good and within walking distance of Translink Day Pass ticket retail locations. For my next hotel choice, I'd recommend improved air temp in a fitness center & air flow in rooms, and ability to park own vehicle.",2017-01-10T19:54:14Z,133
3377,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"This hotel was perfect for our few night stay. The room was clean, the lobby felt very upscale and trendy. The location was perfect...walking distance to Stanley Park and many shops and restaurants right outside the hotel doors.  The staff was friendly. Theres a restaurant in this hotel which I read is very good, but we didn't get to check it out.  I didn't find anything extraordinary about this hotel but I'd stay again. It was simple and just what was needed. One thing I didn't like was the expensive parking but then again, that appears to be the situation for all hotels downtown. :)",2018-01-07T01:52:37Z,133
3378,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Great location at the west end of Robson.  Walking distance to great food and shopping.  The art was just average.  One medium and one small painting in the room.  I did like the metal spring figures near the elevator.  The rooms seem older as the closet doors were squeaky and the ventilation fan vibrated all the time.  It did provide some nice white background noise though.  Our fridge was also broke, but they promptly replaced it.

Newly renovated bathroom.  Looks like the rooms next to us are still undergoing the upgrades, but should be done soon.  Very nice Kohler fixtures.  The bathroom mirror was also pretty sweet.  It has a power button on the mirror to turn on a surround light.  Warning: Watch out for the rain shower head in the ceiling.  I turned on the shower expecting water from the handheld sprayer at waist level and got blasted with cold water from above.  It took me a minute to figure out how to switch the water source.  Hint it is under the faucet but was out of my view.  

Suggestion for hotel maintenance - finish tile work behind the vanity mirror as the new mirror doesn't completely cover the old area.  Also need to repaint door jam to bathroom.  These are minor things that should have been included in the remodel.

Overall it was a decent place to stay for the price.  We got a good deal with reduced rate and AMEX gift card as part of a Vancouver tourism promo.  Likely wouldn't stay here at the normal rate.",2017-04-01T06:20:48Z,133
3379,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Expedia listed this hotel as a 3.5 hotel and the price is very competitive!

I booked the Gallery room which was pretty spacious w/ 2 Queen Beds. My only grip is the bathroom looked a bit dated as did the floor. They have some special touches such as: Complimentary Wine from 5-6pm, delivered drip coffee at requested time, and they also left cookies in the car for us after we checked out. This is the only hotel I've ever stayed at that did this. 

Extra stars for the friendly staff. Be Prepared for the high parking fee, although its unlimited valet services 24 hours a day.",2017-01-02T12:15:14Z,133
3380,The Listel Hotel,3.9,We spent two nights in Vancouver at the Listel on Robson Street. We booked a king room and we were upgraded to a king suite!!! It was awesome to say the least. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was unbelievable. They have a soaking tub that is part of the shower. It must be seen to truly believe. The suite was very large. The artwork from the First Nations was on display throughout the suite. My husband is a member of the Squamish Nation. We had artwork from some of his relatives in our suite. Fate works in  mysterious ways. We dined at Forage and Timber restaurants located within and beside the hotel. They were both great. We used valet as that is the only option. It is pricey but parking in most large cities usually is. The day we left the valet brought our car around and on the dash were wrapped chocolate chip cookies thanking us for our stay. Enough said right ? I look forward to returning soon. Listel you definitely won our hearts with the upgrade into a suite with artwork from our family.,2019-09-19T00:38:00Z,133
3381,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Solid 3 stars if I was a tourist staying here, haven't been here other than the lobby which is a bit on the tiny side, and you're literally side by side with the reservation ppl at the front.

Good, safe location, with plenty to eat around here, and the 'outside' shopping just a few blocks away, though you're far from the main mall Pacific Centre.",2014-05-31T11:35:46Z,133
3382,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Stayed at the Listel during a recent weekend in Vancouver.  Location is good, walkable to Stanley Park, the water, Pacific Place shopping, Gastown and more.  Staff was very nice and helpful.

The property is old and worn out.  I know the Listel prides itself on its art collection but I would rather they put some money into updating the rooms.  The rooms are 20 years old in style - but they have ""original"" art on the walls.  Sorry - if I want to see original art I will go to a gallery or an art museum.

The bathroom was tiny and in need of serious maintenance and updating.  Tiles were cracked, trim was chipped, touch up paint did not match giving a very impressionistic art effect - maybe that is what they were going for.  To me it looked like an old apartment that the landlord quickly touches up with whatever paint can he finds.  Ceiling tiles in the hallway were broken and dingy, with dirt and dust accumulated on them.  They do not have bottled water but they have a spring and sparkling dispenser in the hall that you can go fill glass bottles with.  Not very convenient and the dispenser vibrates the whole wall as you fill your water bottles.  Glad I did not have the room next to the water station, that noise would have been awful everytime someone got water.

It seemed that most of the guests were older and either on their way or just off of a cruise or bus tour.  So for those guests the bathrooms might not be so small in comparison to the bathrooms on the cruise ships and motor coaches.  

I just expected the Listel to be a nicer, boutique hotel.  Instead it is a two star run of the mill hotel with art.  Sorry the art does not improve the room or the stars.",2016-06-22T12:17:57Z,133
3383,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Stayed here for our first trip to Vancouver. The hotel was fine, cleanliness was okay as the room had a few dirty marks on the tables etc. The parking is an absolute joke, way over priced at $36 per day! Depending on what you're going to Vancouver for will depend if you like this location. It is about 30 minutes to walk to Gastown, Yaletown or the boat to Granville Island. There isn't a lot of food options except for Chinese, Japanese etc. Downtown Vancouver is extremely busy so be aware of this when booking in this area. I personally can't stand being in places that are so congested with people so that put me off a lot, but that is totally my personal opinion.",2019-01-02T19:15:17Z,133
3384,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"I had a really good stay at The Listel. This four star hotel was around $160(CAN) a night, a fair price when taking the location into consideration.

Check-in was very smooth and fast, as we had paid online. We were informed that there would be complementary wine served from 5pm-6pm. What a great surprise! We stayed in a standard room and it was pretty spacious. A clean room with tasteful art on the walls really added to the ambience. Another great surprise was that we had a mini fridge! (as it was not listed on the room description/features) I had no idea about how much this hotel valued environmental awareness. We had these really cute bins for organics and recycling underneath one of the counters, and I believe the toilet paper was made out of eco-friendly material. This was such a plus in my books. One thing I did notice is that it took quite a while to get hot water from the sink running. I also read about free cookies at check-out but we never received any. I suppose I will live though!

Overall, the Listel is a nice hotel. You are in the heart of downtown, minutes away from great shops, sites, and restaurants. It may not be the trendiest or newest place to stay, but it definitely makes up for it in its small perks and location.",2016-02-18T01:40:08Z,133
3385,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"I stayed here for a week on business and enjoyed every minute of it.  Who wouldn't love being paid to stay at a great hotel in a beautiful city such as this!

The Listel Hotel is located on one end of Robson Street and is also a short walk to the West End and Stanley Park.  It's a really neat boutique hotel that features a well-considered art collection, and a certain fun and hip flair and charm.  The rooms are comfortable and well appointed and the staff is attentive and warm.  The attached O'Doul's Restaurant and Bar is also a great place to go.

The Listel has reduced its carbon footprint by installing solar panels and a heat recovery system.",2008-09-04T12:35:21Z,133
3386,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Came here for the BC PSCA Conference. We had about 50 people seated in the Impressionist Gallery, and everything was easily accessible. The staff are wonderful and their meeting rooms and overall interior design is beyond beautiful. They're connected to Forage next door, so all the food was catered by them. I'm pretty sure I died a number of times from happiness because everything tasted so well. 

We ended up booking a hospitality room from them on top of the meeting room, and that was comfortable and roomy for about 20+ people or so. From what I heard while dialoguing with other conference attendees, the hotel rooms were very comfortable and they all really enjoyed their stay. 

Parking is valet and $4/hour, flat rate of $14/day until 6pm, $10/evening added on after that. It's about an eleven minute walk away from Burrard Skytrain station, so if you're here for a conference, I'd recommend taking transit.",2016-05-03T23:51:00Z,133
3387,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"I recently returned to Vancouver for a wedding, and I had another pleasant stay at The Listel Hotel. It has everything you need. I love how I can walk to shopping, great sushi and Stanley Park. It's a good thing you can walk everywhere, because getting a taxi in Vancouver is hell. If you're going to the airport or somewhere important, call down at least 15 minutes before and the staff will hook you up.",2017-09-13T17:22:25Z,133
3388,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"The hotel is very convenient to downtown and all of the great shopping on Robson Street.  I was a little worried that I would be too far removed to enjoy all the stores, but this was definitely not the case.  We were upgraded to the 6th floor which was nice, but I am not sure what the difference between rooms would have been.  

I thought our room was clean and spacious.  There was not much of a view but I was okay with that since I was hardly in the room much anyway.  A very nice touch was the free pot of coffee offered every morning via room service.  All you had to do was fill out a little card each night and leave it on the door declaring whether you wanted decaf or regular and when you wanted it delivered and it would magically appear in the morning.

Staff was very friendly and courteous.  They took initiative from taking our bags up to the room to making sure our taxis arrived in a timely manner.  The bartenders downstairs were very fun to talk to as well.  I would definitely stay here again.",2012-06-19T01:58:10Z,133
3389,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"The red buddha men all over this hotel kinda freaked me out at first, but I grew fond of them after a few days...and was actually sad to say farewell to them before heading back to Chicago.

When I arrived at the hotel after midnight I was not only greeted by these red buddha men, but 2 friendly guys at the desk. They informed me that I was being upgraded to the honeymoon suite- whoo hoo!  When I first entered the room my first thought was ""this is not where I'd want to spend my honeymoon"" based on the dated decor, but it was spacious and comfortable...and perfect for my 2 night work trip.

I didn't spend very much time in my ""honeymoon suite,""  but my colleagues and I did make ourselves at home in the conference room. They provided a delish breakfast  and great service throughout our stay as well.

The Listel is also centrally located and there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. While it wasn't the most luxurious hotel experience, I'd be open to staying here again for the right price.",2012-11-29T05:18:15Z,133
3390,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"For the price, it was ok. Front desk service wasn't great (maybe even bad?), with the attendants seeming annoyed when I had to come inside and ask for my car to be valeted (which is mandatory and $36 if you want to park a car). We then had to lug in our bags (I thought that was part of the point of doing valet?), wait a long time for the reception to stop chatting with each other to check us in, and then weren't told how to get to our rooms. I ended up asking someone doing housecleaning about where my room was and they were far more helpful. Hotel itself was pretty and clean but not worth the effort.",2018-03-26T14:27:00Z,133

The hotel is committed to green energy, and one of the features they had was a tap on each floor with water, both flat and fizzy. They also have bicycles which you can use for free for up to three hours (but they don't start until 9 am, so sleep in). They had a wine reception from 5-6 every day. There is a small fitness cebter, but if you take your room key about two blocks away you can use the Steve Nash gym for free. I could go on forever about the Listel, or you can just go.

3394,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"It's a lovely space. 
My favorite perk, complimentary French pressed coffee delivered to your door every morning at your desired time. I spent a whopping 14 nights at this hotel and it the coffee and the staff really eased the homesick feels we attain when being away for so long. The hotel is very artsy, gallery floors featuring art in every room. 
The hotel prides itself on being very ""green"" which is just fantastic. Containers for recycling and organic material in every room. The bathroom amenities are not as up to date as any other hotels so if ""luxury"" is your style you might find this place less suitable for your standards. I found everything charming with a bit of age. 
My biggest complaint about the hotel: the charge to use the microwave - $10.50/day. After eating out non stop I wanted to reheat some leftovers. It was unnecessary. 
But! Free wine everyday from 5-6 in the lobby.",2015-11-09T04:36:37Z,133

They had a daily wine tasting--I'm not really a big wine drinker, so I learned a bit about wine just by staying at the Listel.  Nice art all over the hotel, including some beautiful work by First Nations people, and a couple of large, springy interactive pieces in front of the elevators that are just plain fun.  My room was very clean and had a great view.  Room enough in the fridge to store a few things.  Free WiFi.  Great location in the west end of downtown, plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance.  I really have no complaints.

3396,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"3.5 stars.  Decent hotel in superb downtown Vancouver location; close to shops, restaraunts, transportation, and attractions.  Consistnetly one of the lower-priced hotels in the area.  Front desk is friendly and generally helpful.  

Notable:

- The lobby is modern but the rooms are Holiday Inn circa 1995, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but may catch you by surprise.  
- The bed and/or pillow was really uncomfortable.  I had a neck cramp for a week after my first night there.
- Tub had a draining issue the first night. 
- WiFi is incredibly slow.  Front desk transferred me over to their IT guy who stated that Apple products may experience connectivity issues.  After ten minutes on the phone with him, a power-off and wait 15 minutes to turn back on, I had OK connection on my phone but not my tablet.  I gave up and went to Blenz down the street (free wifi with purchase - ask for code).  
- Gym was a pleasant surprise.  Sufficient equipment, water cooler, and restrooms. They even had a spin bike.

So, for the price you pay, you get a pretty good deal.  But if you are looking for a luxury experience, think about spending some more $ per night elsewhere.",2014-07-17T23:18:52Z,133

The two restaurants next door, Forage and Timber, are very good places to eat at.  There are a variety of Asian restaurants just across the street but I can get those at home. I would stay here again for sure because of the hotel and it's location on Robson Street.",2017-06-09T00:04:01Z,133
3398,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"I've stayed here twice now when I've been in BC and both times, I've rec'd excellent customer service, comfy beds, nice rooms... and can we talk about location?! It's right smack dab in the middle of great shopping and not far from some great restaurants.

The prices have always been fair when I've stayed here (I got a great rate from Hotwire) and the front desk hosts some of the most attentive hotel staff I've ever encountered.

FYI: If you park in their overnight parking, rest assured your car will be safe. There's issues with break-ins in Vancouver (I speak from experience) and you will sleep well knowing that not only will your car come back exactly as you left it with the staff, but that there will also be complimentary cookies as a thank you gift on the dash. How nice is that?

Very. :)

3399,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"I will admit, I was a little worried about staying at the Listel during my visit to Vancouver.  Yelp and trip advisor had mixed reviews but thanks to a hotels.com deal, I booked a room for three nights here. 

I had originally asked for two queen beds but by the time I checked in, they only had rooms with King beds left.  To make up for that, they put a cot in the room.   

The room was great and the hotel is in a good location - next to lots of shops and restaurants. The front desk was always friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and spacious. 

My only complaint is the bed - that thing was hard and uncomfortable.  If I ever go back to Vancouver (which I totally am), I am going to totally consider staying at the Listel again!",2013-09-18T05:41:58Z,133
3400,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"The Listel Hotel on Robson was my unofficial home base for an inaugural five-day stay in Vancouver. This boutique hotel promises museum-like visual appeal with the injection of Canadian art throughout and a few levels of 'gallery rooms' like the one I would be staying in that as they say, have been designed as an individually gallery of original art. Needless to say, my expectations were rather high.

Staff were friendly enough upon arrival but are definitely the type to keep looking at their computer screens until you are standing on top of them at the counter. No welcomes or hellos - but on the service front they certainly do their jobs. The modern lobby was always nice to come back to and the hotel itself was easy enough to navigate.

As for my actual room -again, I feel it's important to point out that this was on the gallery floor - it just lacked any personality. Not only was it entirely beige from curtains to walls to floor to duvet, the whole gallery aspect of it all really just came down to two small, 9x12 framed pieces on either end of the room. On the plus side, the bed was really comfortable and the room itself was surprisingly large despite being pretty empty.

The shower had great water pressure but was finicky on the temperature front and the extent of bath products provided was a simple no-name shampoo, conditioner, and body wash dispenser installed in the shower itself.

I'll echo some of the sound-proofing comments but also mention that it's not something to worry much about. Even over the weekend, I never got the feeling that this was a party hotel. The only sounds I heard were from the cleaning staff in the mornings rather than Jersey Shore wannabes at night.

All in all, nothing outrageous or offensive - just not really anything to get too excited about here.",2012-05-03T12:20:17Z,133
3401,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"This was the first time we ever tried booking through Hotwire. We purchased three nights at a mystery ""4-star"" hotel in downtown Vancouver for a rate comparable to many listed in the ""2 1/2 to ""3-star"" range.

We typed in our credit card number, crossed our fingers, and hoped for the best. Our expectation was we'd end up in a nice hotel in a flawed location, either far away from the attractions we planned to visit and/or bordering on a seedy part of downtown. When the hotel name was finally revealed, we were THRILLED to see we were booked at The Listel, with its desirable location on Robson Street.

We also liked the idea of an art-themed boutique hotel and the prospect of having interesting visual treasures filling the walls our room. This is where we allowed our expectations to rise too high.  After all, we were the ""low rent"" guests.

We ended up with room on the second floor, where the ""standard"" (read: almost art-free) rooms are located. All artsy rooms were on the floors above us. Although comfortable and tastefully designed, I think we would have been a tad disappointed if we had paid the hotel's full-rate for this type of room.

Some details about our room:

Room Temp: very comfortable, even though it was quite warm outside during our stay.

TV: nice wall mounted flat-screen

Internet: wireless and free

Mattress: adequately comfortable

Shower Head: adequate

Cleanliness: I noticed a little tiny bit of mold on the permanent part of the shower curtain, but otherwise, clean.

Bathroom: TINY! (and I didn't expect to see the glued-to-the wall plastic shampoo pump dispenser in this class of hotel)

Outlets: only one located near the bed, which is for the lamp and clock radio to be plugged-in. This was a problem since my wife and I both like to plug-in our laptops close to our bed. However, the staff was quick to provide us with a powerstrip.

FRONT DESK / VALET / MISC

Check-in / Check-out - Fast and friendly.

Valet- Not around when we arrived. We had to mention this to the front desk person who was checking us in. However, during the rest of our stay, they were very responsive.

Valet Parking fee - $35 per day! Gulp. The desk clerk claims this is a very reasonable price for downtown Vancouver. I'm not an authority on this topic, but I bet a lower price can be had.

Restaurant - Didn't get a chance to eat there. It looked very nice though.. and appeared to be a great jazz club in the evening.

Depending on the rate, we would certainly consider The Listel when visiting Vancouver in the future.",2010-08-29T22:55:22Z,133
3402,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"From the little monk/buddha things in the courtyard to the springy masses of sculpture by the elevators (go on, touch one), The Listel seems to have a different kind of art piece at every turn. I didn't understand the reason for most of the art going on everywhere... but then again, I don't understand most art to begin with whether it be weird paintings that I can't make heads nor tails out of or sculptures meant to represent something I have no notion of. That being said, I like things that are different, and the art at The Listel is certainly that. 

The location is convenient for downtown access and the meeting rooms suffice for any group powwows you may need to host. 

Rooms are well turned down. I couldn't hear my neighbours in any direction (mind you, I had a corner unit), it was cleaned well daily and it passed the bed bug test my roommate makes me do whenever I'm away on business (because one of these days I'm going to bring them home with me???). There were no lipstick stains on my cups, towels that looked like they hadn't been changed, nothing of the sort. Oh yes, I check. My friends have way too many hotel room horror stories. Thankfully, The Listel didn't add any in for me.

There aren't a ton of great eateries directly in the vicinity of the hotel, but again, the location is central enough that if you head a few blocks up or down Robson, you'll find something you enjoy.

Overall, I had a pleasant stay and I think you would too!",2012-12-25T05:31:46Z,133
3403,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Like a lot of people here, I ended up at the Listel through Hotwire.  The location is the hotel's selling point and I have to admit that it came in very handy.  Yes, valet parking is the only thing you can do to bridge the four hour gap when the self-park garage ""closes"" but hey, we were on vacation so what's another $27?

The staff was friendly to us although I don't think we ever saw the same person at the front desk (and we passed the front desk like 20 times).  The flat screen TV in the room was awesome and had tons of cable choices.  The beds and drapes did look like a standard hotel and not like a boutique, and the bathroom did need a facelift.  However, I didn't get bedbugs and slept fine so what more would you need?  The location is also super easy to find for people coming in from out of town.  We did overlook an alley from our room but I don't think there are ""views"" and we weren't promised this so we didn't mind.

I do think even with Hotwire's cheap rate it was on the more expensive end for what we got, but we could walk ANYWHERE we needed to go and that was really nice.  I will look at other places in the future but at least I know what to expect and where this hotel is just in case I need that ace in my back pocket in the future.",2010-05-25T20:06:34Z,133
3404,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"This place suuucks!
We stayed here with a booking thru hotwire.com. I was shocked that this place calls itself a ""boutique"" hotel, and 4stars?! Please.. I've stayed at hostels that are nicer! 
I'll give it to them the lobby is nice, a bit quirky with the paintings.. But the room sucked! We got a 2 bedroom room, being a couple this was not necessary.. There was nothing but drabby brown coloured drapes orange carpet and a horrible desk in our room. The bathroom left much to be desired as well. To be honest it looked like your typical holiday inn.. And the view from our room was a back alley of some apartment building.. Sweet. 
The real icing on the cake was the 20-30$ parking fee.. 
Never again listel.. Never again!",2010-05-06T00:28:24Z,133
3405,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"If you're a shopping and Japanese food fiend, you absolutely cannot beat the location.  Super super convenient to have your room close by to drop your bags/gear off so you can have more room in your hands to shop some more.  Most importantly, the location is prime for your next drunken Izakaya crawl!

The rooms are excellently priced, quiet, cozy, comfy, and clean.  They may not have gold-plated toilets and fixtures, but its perfect for unwinding after a day/night in the city. 

I will vouch for the questionable overnight street parking in the vicinity (rather the lack thereof).  The valet underground parking is well worth it if not a necessity.  Let me put it this way: $300 shattered window replacement or $12 parking?  You have in-and-out privileges and the valet driver -at least the one I remember, is super mindful of your car, and will have your car ready for you out front in a flash with not a scratch or scrape on it.  Don't forget to tip your Valet!

The staff is super helpful and accommodating.  When we checked-out, they offered to hold our stuff in secure storage while we went out and grabbed lunch -something not always offered at other places.

The Listel is one of my favorite places to stay at when in my beloved Vancouver and I always recommend them to friends and family and now my fellow Yelpers!

Check their website often as they have really good specials you won't find elsewhere!",2009-06-15T19:03:30Z,133
3406,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"I recently stayed here while on Business but the hotel would also be  great for  a vacation visit to the city. Easy walking down to the convention center and harbor

Also about a 15 min walk to city center sky train station",2014-05-20T03:58:47Z,133
3407,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Decent value, and great location, but I expected more out of this place. Everything seemed a tad... laid back?

The rooms were okay, neat bay window seats and decor... but they weren't the cleanest. They were tidy, and cleaned, but the staff could put in a little extra effort. Maybe we are a bit picky but there was dust and grime in all the little nooks and crannies... I think if you choose to have ornate artwork and bathroom hardware you should also choose to dust them?

The front staff could have been a bit more professional too; they all seemed a bit rookie. And it would be great if they were more in tune with the city. We asked for advice on dinner for something that that was new and hip for our night out on the town, and the concierge recommended the Old Spaghetti Factory! Haha",2014-03-31T04:33:25Z,133
3408,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"It was my first time to Vancouver and I stayed at the Listel Hotel. The hotel was great and it was in the heart of downtown Vancouver. All the restaurants and shops were within walking distance and that was important to me since I didn't have to search for places to go. 

The staff were friendly and I even got an upgrade to a bigger room. I definitely recommend that newcomers stay here at least one night. Leave your car with the parking attendant and go for a nice stroll down the street.",2009-07-16T04:54:35Z,133
3409,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"I only read the reviews on this place after I had already arrived and I would have to agree with all of the 5 star reviews and can only assume that Maria J - below -  stayed at a different Listel Hotel.... 

On arrival the desk staff jumped up and rushed to greet the taxi helped unload the bags and then checked us in before escorting us to our room up on the 6th floor. The local art on display both in the rooms and public spaces was great so unusual...

As in some of the other reiews we had a room facing out onto Robson Street and also spent some time watching people watching us from the appartments opposite - much more entertaining than Fox...!!!!

The free wirelees hook-up allowed access to Yelp to sus out the where to's in Vancouver.... 

Highly recommend it....",2009-06-09T00:31:36Z,133
3410,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Listel. It was centrally located which was super convenient. They had complementary morning coffee service to the room which I thoroughly enjoyed! The only thing was it was not quite as artful as I expected, however it was still cool to see the art they did have. I imagine some of the meeting rooms may have more art to view. The rooms were clean, the staff was friendly, and overall I would recommend this hotel!",2017-04-21T02:51:38Z,133
3411,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"This is a great boutique hotel in the heart of downtown Vancouver.  Part of the Luxe Hotel Collection, there's plenty of art in all the rooms and public areas.  This hotel could pass for a boutique museum. There's a tiny workout room, Jacuzzi and restaurant onsite. It's a little old and it's no Four Seasons by any means, but it's a great stay and well within budget. 

If you're in town for Vancouver pride, this hotel is located right on the parade route and it's a few blocks away from all the bars on Davie street.",2013-04-16T04:40:14Z,133
3412,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"This hotel was a pretty decent selection. not the most modern that I've stayed at, however the staff were friendly, the location was convenient and heck it had a really sweet zen thing going on with the decor.

Here is a quick rundown of how I arrived at the 3-star score above: 

DA PROS!
-ART everywhere! Red Squatting Monks, Asian fusion design work +1
-Basic Comfy beds + 1/2 (not the best but better than many others I've crashed on)
-Umbrella service +1 (this was awesome - anytime it rained they had the BEST umbrellas ready to go at front desk for you - I wanted to steal one....but I didnt)
-Friendly staff +1/2 met my expectations spot on!

DA CONS
-Out of date decor in hotel, elevators and rooms -1 (no flat screens in rooms and poor cable selection) -1
-Wifi was spotty and slow -1

I think with a little renovation love and some updated room amenities this place will become a shiny 4 star in my humblest of opinions :)

3413,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Sweet little arts-themed hotel in the heart of downtown Vancouver. We stayed in a room on the gallery level - which was comfortable and had an air of recent renovation. A fresh pot of French press was delivered in the morning, which was a nice touch. (Yes, tea is an option if you are not a coffee drinker.)

From the hotel, you are steps away from shopping, dining Canada Place on the harbour. From there you can rent a bike and follow the trail to Stanley Park, or catch the SkyTrain to other parts of the city and beyond. 

Valet parking is about $30/night (which is on par for inner-city parking) and includes in/out privileges.",2014-09-02T06:36:21Z,133
3414,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Had a great experience, and it was an overall gorgeous hotel - there's lovely and unique artwork in each of the rooms.

3415,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"I didn't actually get the opportunity to stay here, so this review is for the concept/lobby. 

If you are a fan of the art boutique hotel, look no further than the Listel. Walking in you are greeted by lifesize male and female wire bobblehead sculptures that dance and wobble when you touch them. OK, I'm sold. How cool is this place? In the upstairs alcove, The Listel is currently showing an art installation called ""Fallen Princesses"", which encapsulates my sense of humor to a tee. ""Not So Little Red Riding Hood"" was my favorite. 

The gym/fitness room was a little lacking, with only 2-3 machines, but I understand they are making plans to update the amenity, which should bring joy to the business traveler with an appreciation for art everywhere.",2009-12-19T19:00:52Z,133
3416,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"I was not impressed. On my honeymoon, we stayed on their fifth floor which was supposed to be a gallery floor. The pictures showed contemporary furniture and I was under the impression it would be filled with art. It was neither. Our room was filled with classic furniture, beige striped walls, and three art pieces. The floor we were on had a couple of mini sculptures. The only contemporary about the room was the bathroom which was European style with narrow and long tub. We had a suite so there were two televisions. The tv in the bedroom didn't work. The tv in the living room was a ""classic"" tub television and we had like 10 channels. 

Since they're remodeling there was no room service. There was coffee and tea service every morning which was pleasant and a nice treat. Their breakfast is a buffet that costs 15 dollars. We did not partake in this so see my Yelp reviews under ""The Honeymoon"" list for a list of breakfasts. 

The hotel is located really close to the heart of Robson. I really liked that we were close to dining, the Vancouver Art Gallery and the shuttle to Capilano Suspension Bridge. The shopping looked like fun but I didn't want to have more stuff so I held back. 

I won't be back to this hotel. I didn't feel they lived up to their marketing and when they're remodeling, they should be dropping their prices.",2012-09-07T04:03:54Z,133
3417,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"My friend and I stayed here over New Year's 2015. It was perfect. 

Check in was a breeze and the cost for 3 nights here was only around $100 USD a night. 

The room was clean, had a large HD tv, comfortable beds and the FREE WIFI was excellent. Our Apple and Android products worked great the entire stay.

The location is also perfect. Robson Street has a ton of stuff to do. There are all kinds of places to eat or drink in every direction. From your typical Tim Horton's, to Japanese, to Korean BBQ, and Italian, you'll find it just steps from your room.

They also held our bags on our last day here after checkout so we could do some last minute exploring before we had to leave town.

Another interesting aspect is the art in the halls and rooms. It is a boutique hotel, so it has a slightly different feel compared to a box hotel like a Hilton or Westin.

I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",2015-01-07T03:12:01Z,133
3418,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Once again, another thanks to Groupon! I've posted this review at every site I could because that's how much my family enjoyed our stay. Seriously worth every penny!

Probably one of the best hotel stays I've ever had. From the moment we checked in, to the moment we checked out, we received excellent customer service. I believed that they went above and beyond to make sure our stay made us feel right at home. Every staff member that we came across were friendly and very helpful. It's in a great location, within walking distance of a variety of stores and restaurants. Their O'Doul's restaurant have THE BEST Eggs Benedict, you've got to try them all =)

I booked this trip through a third party and have now contacted them to make them aware of the situation.  I would not have booked this hotel had I known it was undergoing construction.

Well, they got my money for this trip but now they get to deal with this review and others reading this can just go on to book another hotel.  Personally I recommend Empire Landmark Hotel nearby.  It is clean and classy and in the same price range.

I gave it 2 stars because the rooms had windows that actually open and they have great hotel staff.  They are professional, nice, and very helpful, especially the concierge.",2017-03-26T21:06:01Z,133
3423,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Like Ben B, I stayed here for four nights while visiting the lovely city of Vancouver. After reading some of these reviews I didn't get my hopes up too high, but I was pleasantly surprised.

Upon arrival (at 11:45 p.m.), the man at the front desk was warm and welcoming. He took one look at me and said ""you must be Andrea"". Freaky? Haha, all my other coworkers had already arrived, so he was lucky. Still, it felt really nice. He was very informative and accomodating, and that goes for the service I had the entire week. Everyone from the cleaning staff to the front desk were cheerful, kind and friendly. An absolute pleasure.

I didn't get much of a chance to check out the art on the floors, but the little red men in the lobby and outside were absolutely darling. The art around the lobby is lovely as well, and there were some unique aboriginal pieces throughout the floors as well.

In terms of the room, it was very basic. Shower/bathtub and toilet were separate from the sink/vanity, and there was good closet space. As Ben mentioned, the toiletries are all no-name, so if your skin is sensitive like minem be sure to bring your own. 

The bed was comfortable and there was a good sized desk with high speed. The wireless was pretty decent as well.

They have a locked mini-bar which was nice, but I wish there had been a bigger fridge so I could have put leftovers in there. A microwave would be awesome too. The tv is pretty old school, and is overshadowed by the cabinet it's in.

Other than the room being pretty mediocre, I was happy to stay here for the week. The surrounding food options were awesome, the staff was nice, and my bed was comfortable. A few more finishing touches and this place would be perfect.",2012-10-23T01:49:27Z,133

3430,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"I'm a relatively kind reviewer so my 2 stars actually means 1 star. I've been to Vancouver many times, stayed in Richmond and Robson street countless times. I got this deal from Hotwire last minute since we didn't plan to stay in Vancouver. It was around $130 for a weeknight stay.

We had a 2 queen bed room facing the alley since they didn't have any facing the street. My one major complaint was the noise from the new hotel construction across the street and the loud garbage truck directly outside below our room waking us up at 8am.  When I go on vacation I like to sleep in. 

The second complaint was the parking. They only offer valet parking for $35! I'm trying to save money by using Hotwire and after getting a decent deal they want me to pay that price on top of my hotel stay?! We ended up parking on Jervis St for free thanks to the front desk night worker who told us about street parking. We were lucky though because most of the streets had no parking from 7am-10am.  

The room specs: clean, standard amenities, hard pillows, we stayed on the sixth floor so the art was native american anthropology.

Hotel Front desk: we had a late check in around 11pm so the employees looked tired, understandable I guess. They did provide a free tooth brush. 

to summarize:
Cons: $35 parking, loud noise= no sleep
Location: at the end of the strip, closer to Stanley park
 
Pros: free wireless internet: so slow that I couldn't watch youtube videos but could send emails",2011-06-22T17:53:09Z,133

3433,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"I'm giving this hotel four stars, because three isn't fair.  Five is too generous.

The concierge was very friendly and although there were a few people in line waiting to check in and what not, he took the time to carefully explain everything about the hotel to each guest, which I thought was very courteous.  No rushing the guest.

The lobby was really interesting (depending on your taste in art.)  Very modern.  The art in the rooms have descriptions of what the art is about.  I was pretty wiped out when I checked in, so I have to be honest- I didn't really explore the art in the hotel, which I kind of regret. 

As for the room.  It was surprisingly small. I've been in hotels in downtown Washington, D.C. for slightly less in price and have had much bigger rooms and, especially bathrooms.  Wow.  The bathroom was really small. There were two queen beds and my friend was able to feel the springs on one side of the bed.  My bed, however, was phenomenally comfortable, so I think my friend's bed was just a mishap.

Now, my favorite part of this hotel--I got a free upgrade to the gallery floor.  Upgrades are ALWAYS fun, but what I was really excited about was the fact that the upgrade included complimentary coffee service- french press coffee, to be precise.  Brought to your room at the time you desire.  Oh my.  For a caffeine addict, this was the best thing to wake up to. 

There were a few other things that were pretty impressive, customer service-wise.  Overall, this place gets five stars for the way I, and my friend, were treated.  For the actual room...three stars. While  the beds were very comfortable and the room was very clean, it just felt a like it needed a face-lift.",2012-11-11T18:51:56Z,133

They also helped with copying papers and answering any questions. The art throughout the hotel is beautiful. The rooms are pretty nice with extremely comfortable beds. The bathroom has the shampoo conditioner and body wash built in instead of having travel size bottles. This can be attributed to their commitment to environmental friendliness.

Nicely crunchy with a nice sugar coating on the inside, very good texture on the inside with some orange zest.",2015-03-28T07:22:42Z,133

3439,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"We stayed here November 2011, after we got engaged. We loved the modern rooms and the city feel of the place, and staff were friendly. The off-season rates are excellent. 

We had a King room, and it was modern, clean and well decorated. 

The old restaurant was nothing worth noting, and was an odd fit for The Listel.  I'm intrigued by Forage, the new establishment. Had I known it was there, I would have booked this hotel again over The Sylvia for our current trip. We wanted to try something on the far West End, and liked the Sylvia for it's historic nature but The Listel has it beat three-fold for character, comfort and hospitality.",2013-02-24T22:14:11Z,133

The staff were courteous and friendly, and the room on the museum level was wonderful.  The bedding was comfortable, the room was a great size, and room service was prompt.  I liked the size--not too many rooms to be overwhelming.  The VIFF was going on at the time, but the hotel did a great job managing the events to where it did not interfere with your stay (bar and restaurant still open, rooms were quiet, etc.).",2008-09-29T19:17:36Z,133

Our room was on the Museum Level, and had a nice view of apartments which we took advantage of. Some may find this disturbing, but there were many people who could see into our rooms from their apartments! For us, catching peeping toms in the act trying to spy into our windows became a large source of entertainment for us later in the night! Other than that, of course, haha , The Listel is also very close to shopping, food and nightlife. Not so much nightlife, but there are a few spots.  We loved every minute of this classy place and will definitely stay again. Also the people who work at the front desk were always very kind and welcoming.",2009-04-25T17:06:13Z,133

3445,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"I tend to not review hotels but rather rely on other people's reviews, but I felt obligated to give a positive review based on my stay here last weekend. I really enjoyed this hotel. The location was perfect, right in the middle of Robson Street. You can walk to just about every single place you'd want to visit in the city, and we only took a cab once the entire weekend on account of some heavy rain. 

Hard to believe the somewhat mixed reviews I've read. The room was very nice, the hotel was fairly updated and safe, and Priya and the ladies at the front desk could not have been more helpful. Free coffee and tea service to your room every morning. Very nice gym. I would recommend staying here if you're in Vancouver, eh?",2014-04-10T19:51:14Z,133

You can't hear at all what your neighbors is doing, which is very very rare to find these days in hotels. The location is good, right on Robson St. Love their art displays. Definitely will come back.",2013-12-24T01:36:47Z,133
3447,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"I've stayed at the Listel about 10 times over the past 10 years.  It is one of my favorite hotels in the world, and for the money, I think it is the best hotel in Vancouver. 

The location is ideal. You can walk from the Listel to most Vancouver attractions--Stanley Park, Yaletown, even the ferry to Granville Island. The downtown SkyTrain stations are also a short walk. Best of all, the hotel is located right where Robson Street starts to turn quieter and more residential--a perfect short distance away from the crowds of shoppers and nightlife.

I've stayed in all three of the advertised room types, as well as one of the penthouse suites. In all cases, the rooms are excellent--clean, fairly sized for the price, and quiet. Each room is its own little art gallery, and the public spaces in the hotel are all filled with various art. I prefer the rooms that face Robson Street, as they tend to have better views even if they are a little less quiet. Free wired and wireless internet access as well as limited long distance phone calls are included with the room. The rooms come with coffee and a typical minibar, as well as Aveda bath products. There is no laundry service.

The staff is awesome. I stayed in the Listel on the night of my engagement, and before we arrived, I called and someone helped me ""secretly"" upgrade to an Artist Series Suite to surprise my fiance. Our room service orders have always arrived promptly. A front desk clerk once gave us free coupons for drinks at O'Douls while we waited for our room upon early arrival. The maids are fast and do a great job. And the valets always leave cookies in the car when we leave. 

The Listel is my first choice in Vancouver. I heartily recommend it.",2010-09-07T00:58:31Z,133
3448,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Does not even deserve one star. Horrible hotel! It's a dump! There's construction going on and we were never informed. There's dust and noise and very hard to enjoy!

They advertised free coffee and when it arrived they wanted to charge me for milk! Do urself a favor & don't waste your money and stay here.",2017-04-12T16:13:24Z,133
3449,The Listel Hotel,3.9,"Spent the day on March 1st, up in Vancouver B.C. at the Canada Place.  I was attending an International Wine Tasting. Great time!
Decided to spend the night this time. The Listel Hotel is right on Robson St, close to a lot of restaurants and a hub of shopping. 
The hotel was very clean, rooms were a normal size, bathroom was small but enough. Water pressure was Alright. The ventilation fan was small so not too big
of help.  
I was on the sixth floor facing the back alley. They had some construction going on. Was loud; but I could still sleep.  Definitely the beds kept me very warm, had to kick away the comforts. So if you like to keep really warm it s the place to be.  The staff was very helpful, while the valet needs to work on being more proactive on taking care of picking up our bags.
But did a good job on getting my accessories from my secured garaged car downstairs.
I would stay there again.  But I'm still looking for an affordable place with great amenities in downtown area. With pool, and hot tub.  Great rooms, and not so much noise.
The hunt continues...

You go to reception, give your car's plate number and receive a parking form.
Place the paper in a visible place and lock your car. ($22+fees per night.) There are 3 elevators, but they are slow. There is an indoor pool and jacuzzi, but someone is always using them. There is also an Original Joe's restaurant, but I haven't had a chance to go there yet. There is a shop next to the hotel where you can get croissants and coffee.",2023-09-19T04:11:07Z,59

Easy enough check-in process, and parking available on premises at $22/night. For us, the hotel is conveniently located and within easy walking distance to most of the places we wanted to visit, including eateries we wanted to try. 

Our room was serviced everyday and staff are friendly. Bed is comfortable and we slept well. Can't complain really. We'd definitely stay here again.",2023-05-02T17:37:33Z,59

We had a high floor room with a kitchen and living room. The bedroom had floor to ceiling windows and lots of light coming in and if one likes to spy on others, there were many condo buildings to look into! 

During our 3 nights, we didn't need to have our room cleaned daily but housekeeping was great to provide new towels, more Keurig cups, and toiletries items. 

The location was convenient and a short walk to Rogers Arena, Robson Street, and the casino. There were many food options close by including an Original Joe's attached to the hotel.

A few of the elevators were smaller than the middle one but the wait wasn't too long. I enjoyed our stay here and would stay here again!",2022-11-11T00:47:37Z,59
3453,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"We spent a couple of nights here as part of our Vacations International offerings. Normally we have family accommodations in this city, but we needed a break and used some points to have a mini vacation. Got a two bedroom suite and it was almost luxurious and such a welcome change!  Impressed with the quick and friendly check in. Surprised to find they have a pool and hot tub but didn't come prepared for that. Really liked the big comfy beds, the little kitchenette, the shower water pressure. Plenty of elevators so you don't need to share ( in covid times). Sleeping in was easy with the thick drapes, and quietness.  Location is terrific and so many things within walking distance.  I've been warned that it can get crazy busy if there's a sporting event or concert happening at nearby BC Place though.  Just around the corner to Costco, lol. 
Now we know about this spot, we'll be coming back again.

The TV, was the only thing that I found a little less than great.  The sound was  very "" tinny "" .  I found all the staff, in the hall , in the elevator, at the front desk, very very helpful, friendly, willing to be of service and help for you.
I enjoyed the pool and the hot tub, and the dry sauna. 
I like the location a lot.  Very close to the Casino, the Yaletown entertainment dist.  and a nice walk to Gas Town.  DO NOT GO TO CHINA TOWN.  it is over run with street people.  Not SAFE at all.  
I luv Vancouver, but man, they sure have a homeless problem.
Anyways, would I stay at the Hotel again ???  Yes.

Got 2 rooms, 2 beds each. Was surprised that there was a kitchenette with a stove and a living room area.  So granddaughter could watch tv in there and we could watch the news in the bedroom.  Space is tight.  One of the beds is flushed against the wall.

The reviews said that there was continental breakfast.  However when we went down to the second floor and showed them our room key, they said you had to be a timeshare holder.

They upgraded us to a 2 bedroom suite, which was really nice (especially after being cramped in a cruise ship room for 7 days!).  Rooms were pretty large, cute view of Vancouver city streets.  Living space was nice, we hung out there and ate some late night munchies.  

Location was GREAT!  We walked up to Stanley Park (a little less than a mile).  Night time there was a lot going on around here. 

Overall great place for the price!",2019-08-30T18:43:28Z,59
3457,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"I don't leave a lot of one star reviews, but thanks to quite possibly the worst service ever I feel this one is well earned. 

My friend had booked our room months ago through Vacations International (VI). She paid a considerable amount of points so we'd have a nice place to stay for a girls weekend in Vancouver. We arrived on Saturday afternoon and checked in, then unloaded our bags onto one of their luggage carts. I thought it was strange that the bellman, who was standing next to the door, neither offered to assist with the bags nor even to hold the door open for my friend as she wrestled our cart in/out the door. 

While she returned to our room with the luggage, I parked the car in their underground garage. The garage is small and the extremely compact spaces were difficult to navigate, even in my not-large sedan. I finally managed to wedge my car in between another sedan and a very large pickup which was taking up most of my space as well. Oh well, such is life in the big city. 

I headed to our room where my friend greeted me and said she was concerned at how dirty it was and wanted my thoughts. I actually grew up in the hotel business and worked in housekeeping over a few summers, so I consider myself knowledgeable about hotel cleanliness issues. It was clear this room had NOT been cleaned prior to our arrival. There was garbage and dirt on the floor. The bathroom sink and tub were messy (including hairs on the walls) and there was an unidentifiable white substance clearly visible on the couch. A closer inspection revealed that the room was not only dirty from the previous guest but had also not been detail cleaned in a long time. For example, all flat surfaces were coated in dust. There was caked-on dirt in the corners and around the furnace. The baseboards and kickplates were soiled and splattered. An inspection of the king bed revealed a tattered blanket, and a second blanket (intended for the pullout couch) was stained with a dark reddish brown substance that could have been blood, feces or hot chocolate. 

But...mistakes happen. And I considered this cleaning issue as a problem the hotel would readily take care of. Imagine my surprise when my friend called the front desk and they told us that, because we had booked the room through VI, they (the hotel) had no responsibility for the room being dirty. And that, furthermore, the VI housekeepers had gone home already so there was nothing that could be done. They also refused to move us to another room. My friend, who is a very persistent person and who had chosen our room expecting 5-star hospitality, insisted that someone come up and view the room. 

Soon a houseman arrived and noted some of the dirtiness. He said he agreed that it was filthy, but reiterated that the VI housekeepers had left so there was nothing he could do. My friend insisted the room be cleaned, so he did ultimately agree to clean it. He surface cleaned the bathroom and vacuumed the floors, which we appreciated. But we still felt we were staying in a dirty room. Shortly we returned to the front desk and showed pictures we had taken of the filthiness. The manager looked them over and said there was nothing they could do because VI is a separate operation than the Rosedale on Robson Hotel. 

It was at this point I felt we were in some strange, surreal situation. We had what was a relatively minor problem, and instead of fixing it they were treating us like second class citizens. The manager handed us a business card for the VI rep (who'd be in the next day) and then brushed us off as if we'd just wandered in aimlessly off the street, not as if we were paying guests at their establishment. Which, despite not having booked our room directly, we technically were! 

The next morning I awoke early craving some coffee. While there was a Keurig in the kitchenette, I craved real cream so I headed to the free breakfast buffet the hotel advertised. The dining attendant asked for my room key, which I presented. He then loudly announced I was not allowed at the buffet because I was a VI guest. I felt like Jack-from-steerage in ""Titanic."" I sheepishly asked if I could just get some coffee and creamer, which he begrudgingly allowed. 

Later, my friend spoke to the VI rep, who made sure our room was more thoroughly cleaned. While we appreciated the gesture, the damage was already done by the attitude of the hotel staff. In fact, I was shocked the next day when  the doorman held the door for me. It was the one and only time I experienced friendly service at this hotel.",2018-10-23T23:39:18Z,59
3458,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"I stayed two days at the Rosedale on Robson and it was a great stay! 

Hotel's location is fantastic (in Yaletown, a few minutes walk from restaurants, bars, etc.). It's definitely the best location you can get in Vancouver. It's close to public transit and the subway station, although I ended up not even using it and just walking everywhere. 

Staff was super friendly and helpful. Check-in/check-out was quick and efficient. You can store your bags for free for the day after you checked out. Room/suite was really big, clean and comfy. My view over Yaletown was pretty nice too. I have zero complaints. There was a small kitchenette in my suite but I did not use it so can't really comment on the amenities. 

As many reviews mention, the furniture/decor does feel a little bit outdated - like early 2000s, but it's not a big deal for me so I still give 5 stars to this property.",2019-02-05T15:53:37Z,59
3459,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"Rose dale on Robson is superbly located next to Yaletown. A Skytrain whisks you from the Vancouver Airport to Vancouver City Center. It is an easy walk from the train station to the hotel. There are about 40 restaurants nearby as well as three Starbucks and a 7-11. It is only a block from the Vancouver City Library. The Hop on Hop Off bus stop is nearby and the concierge can arrange it for you. It is located within walking distance of Chinatown, Gastown, Vancouver Overlook, and lot's of great shopping.
You can catch a City bus or trolly nearby. Stanley Park is assessable via bus.
A Hop on Hop off Ferry makes several stops on the beautiful False Creek waterway and the dock is a short walk.

The appliances in the suite are from the 70s and have not been updated in 40 years. The TV did not work and the closet was TINY. Such an impractical design and layout. I can't believe this place runs $350 per night. I will never stay at this hotel ever again. And I would never recommend it to anyone. 

Only thing good about it is the location.",2017-08-19T22:45:08Z,59

3462,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"When my friend and I first arrived in Vancouver we went to the hotel and asked if they could hold our bags until we could officially check in at 4PM since we were early, which the hotel staff allowed us to do.  It was one of the positives to staying here and left a great first impression.  

The room was fine, for the most part.  There are kitchenettes in every room, which also include kitchen accessories like mugs, pots and pans, etc...  It was also nice to have a Keurig, but though there was an electric kettle, it didn't work very well so we ended up microwaving water for tea.  However, I did like that in the room there was a suite/living area outside of the bedroom, which made sharing a room great.  The couch had a pull-out bed, in addition to an extra blanket and pillows.  There was a TV in both of the rooms, too, so my friend and I could have our own space.  

Some negatives were that after our first night there we expected our room to be cleaned during the following day while we were out, like any other hotel, so we were surprised to find that our room wasn't cleaned up when we got back.  Also, in the living room you can hear spurts of loud noise coming from the ventilation, which made it difficult for me to fall asleep and the walls are very thin, so I could hear people stepping out of the elevator in the hall and walking to their room.  

The best thing about this hotel is the location.  Because of its downtown location - walking to Yaletown, Gastown, International District, etc... was very accessible.  Glad to know this is an option for when I visit Vancouver again, especially if I need to share a room again.",2017-06-19T21:36:05Z,59
3463,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"STEER CLEAR! This place is GROSS! 
I wish Negative stars were an option.
We flew up to Vancouver, BC to attend my Mother's wedding. Our Aunt had booked a night here for us, on her timeshare with her points. Our flights were delayed due to the rain, so when we arrived at the hotel it was a little after 8pm. We were exhausted! We checked in and couldn't wait to settle into our room to sleep off the long day. However, when we got to our room, we quickly noticed that there were stains everywhere. Not like dirt stains, but BLOOD stains! There were blood stains on the bathtub, blood stains on the window curtains, and someone had even written their name in permanent marker on our pillow case! We called front desk to see about a room change, however, they denied our request because since we had booked with Timeshare points, this was handled by the VI desk across from them, which was conveniently closed. We shrugged it off and decided to lay in bed and watch some TV. The TV of course had a weak signal and we couldn't even watch TV! We called again to front desk to see if there was anything we could do. The front desk rep went to the back to speak to their supervisor. When she came back on the line she told us the same thing, there was nothing they could do because we booked using out timeshare points! This is a RIDICULOUS policy! Timeshare points or not, if you have a guest who is telling you there is still blood stains and permanent marker all over their room, you clean the room or at least bring new pillows! I honestly felt like we were on a prank show, it was that bad! The room we were in had doors leading onto a balcony, that of course, you cannot open because they bolted the handles shut from the outside! It was creepy, because the balcony had chairs and a table out there, but you can't get to it because the doors won't open. I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. You would probably find a better motel with better customer service in the crack alleys of Hastings!",2019-02-14T23:41:07Z,59
3464,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"Stayed here over Veteran's Day weekend to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. It was our first time to Vancouver and were excited that we found a hotel close to Yaletown and all the hustle and bustle of the shops.

We arrived, payed to park our car in their underground parking garage and noticed that it doubled as public parking as well.  We were only staying three nights so we figured we would be okay. hotel elevators were tiny and the hallways looked a bit dirty but we really were only going to sleep there so meh. 

On the second night we were woken up in the middle of the night by a call. Our car had been broken into. Not just our car, multiple cars. They had broken the back window and crawled in taking with them a backpack with a jacket. Thankfully we didn't have any other valuables in the car. 

The hotel offered to reimburse our parking which was nice. Except that Canadian dollars are not as valuable as American dollars and therefore we still ended up losing money. We had to drive across the border with a broken back window because the day we were scheduled to leave was a Canadian holiday and everything was closed.

Great amenities, very helpful staff, and clean rooms. They helped us find local marts and called arranged a cab for us when we left. The only problem was: slow Wi-Fi. I mean, it was quite terrible from our suite. It worked best when we near the living room or in the lobby - which is such a shame for people visiting from another country and limited in terms of the what-to-do.

I would not mind staying here again. Although the Wi-Fi was bad, it forced my friends and me to explore Vancouver the old-fashioned way: just walking around and asking people for tips. Thanks for the great stay!",2015-12-23T20:24:07Z,59

If my stay was longer I would have purchased some food for breakfast. The hotel offers free breakfast, but it is very continental. Danishes, bread, fruit, yogurt, and coffee/tea and juice. 

The location is really fantastic for downtown and there are so many great places to eat around the hotel. The room had really amazing view too which is always a fun bonus. 

The only negative I have is being charged $2 to check our luggage when we checked out of the room and needed a place to store it before our flight.

We're on a Time Share, so people like us, don't get the hotel freebies, like lotions, shampoos, conditioners (not that I need that, but I'm used to having hotel shampoos to wash my hair @ least 1x a week). All the stores we went to, only carry 2-1 and I don't use that. But, once the clerk in the lobby found out I'm on Time Share, she said, I don't get one! Fine!

In our room, we have everything else to keep us maintained for the next few days!  It is clean, it is equipped with microwave, dishwasher, slow wi-fi in the beginning we couldn't log in for a VERY long time, I almost went downstairs & demanded help.  It just takes patience, and I have that, but it can be VERY frustrating! Our closet is about 2' wide. We have 2 TV in our room. It's also a plus that we can open one of the windows, for fresh air without getting rain inside in our bedroom!

There is NO FREE parking here. We are close to many restaurants, and a good walk away to Chinatown.",2015-09-01T05:14:43Z,59

Rooms are one bedroom suites, with living room and kitchenette. The hotel has an indoor pool, dry sauna and a jacuzzi that's only open till 10pm though. The staff is friendly and helpful and there are taxis right outside the hotel entrance. There is a nice bar and restaurant too by the lobby area that's open very late. There are many dining options just around the corner from the hotel and tourist attractions are walkable or very short taxi or uber rides. This hotel is nothing fancy but its clean, safe, has comfortable beds and has a great location plus the rate per night is very reasonable.",2017-04-17T21:37:50Z,59

The workout room consisted of a few machines that looks like they came from the 80's and the pool was tiny.  The furnishings in the room were very old and not in the best of repairs. 

When we asked for a refund because we checked out without spending the night it was so bad, we were told we were SOL. I would stay anywhere but here next time.",2017-01-01T17:53:40Z,59

However, the bed was a bit squishy, the bedding smelled of BO (eww), and there was an all night long noise... Sounded like a mix between someone tapping, a lose animial, and water leaking/dripping... I guess it didn't help that I was in one of the rooms numbered xx13... 

Elevator was slow too, and it isn't cheap.",2015-09-16T21:51:52Z,59
3477,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"We stay here as part of Vacation International (our timeshare). We LOVE the location.  Its close to a lot of great venues (especially if you love sports).  But, the rooms have occasionally been less than impressive (ie, clean towels found on the floor- likely from falling off the shelf- upon check in, damaged baseboards, minor imperfections).  The ""fitness center"" isn't remotely close to acceptable.  It consists of a few very out of date and not totally functioning correctly, pieces of cardio machines and thats it.  It is also located right infant of big glass windows so anyone walking by on the street (and a lot of people do) can stare at you as you try to run on their questionable treadmill.  This was a big disappointment for us.  However, due to the location and the not affiliated restaurant and bar located off the lobby doors, I'd still give them 4 stars.",2018-04-16T23:28:46Z,59
3478,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"For what you're paying for and the location, this place is almost as god as it gets in Vancouver, BC. I booked this place when my dad and aunt came to visit me in Seattle, and I wanted to show them the jewel that is Vancouver. The room had two doubles and a sofa bed and could easily accommodate 6 people. I wish I booked this place when my mom and brother visited, but now I know. The room had dishes, a sink, a microwave, and a refrigerator, so it's a great pre-party spot. It was also very clean and well maintained. And best of all, it's walking distance to everything in Vancouver. Great room for large parties, parties in general, and anyone who wants to be close to the action.

3479,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"There are hotels, and then there are suite hotels, and there, standing out in a field all by itself, is the Rosedale on Robson. It's not a timeshare, it's not your standard suite hotel, it's not a boutique it's... what you get when you gamble on Priceline. 

Normally I refuse to let Priceline choose my hotel, but with high rates over the Labour Day weekend, I needed some good news, and the 3-stars Priceline ascribes to this hotel had me reassured that the price was right. After the big reveal (once my money was paid), I Yelped the ROR and had that gut-check moment of ""I knew I shouldn't have done this"" queasiness. Oh man. 2.5 stars. What did I get myself in to? 

""Well this isn't so bad,"" I thought to myself as we checked in. Our room was ready early, the front desk staff is nice, and the location is great - away from the main chaos of Robson, close to BC place and Gastown, lots within walking distance. Sure the lobby smells like... what's that smell? I can't place it. Must be something someone just cooked in the restaurant connected to the lobby. Never mind, because our room is clean, spacious and has a kitchenette in it. That's handy. 

In fact, all of the things the other Yelpers said about this hotel - rude staff, dirty rooms, etc - are just not true! The staff are nice, the room is clean, the location is good, the noise is low. It's a great place for home base when adventuring in the city. 

Sure that smell in the lobby isn't going away, but I'm sure it will be gone by tomorrow. I can't quite place it. It smells like meat of some sort, but also maybe B.O.? Anyway, we'll just head to the room and hook up to the free wifi... well, only one device that is. For any devices more than one, it's $5/day. That's kind of lame. But you can sit in the lobby using free wifi on any device, as long as you don't mind the.... smell. What IS that smell? Okay, nix the lobby idea, we can share the one connected device in our room. 

The beds in our double-double are comfortable enough. The pillows work. While the air-conditioner is loud, fortunately it's cool enough we don't need it (really). So we can hang out in our room because every time we roll through the lobby... It's. That. Smell. Again. 

Damn it's convenient to have a kitchenette in our room. We can go to the IGA and the liquor store up the street, stock up on cheese and wine, and have a little happy hour in our room. Because we can only imagine that the restaurant has the same smell as the lobby. 

Well, three days are enough. Checking out was easy enough. They even offered us until 1pm to check out. That's nice. But we want to go exploring on our last day, so we ask them to hold our bags. Unfortunately this costs $1 per bag, and the two carry-on roller-boards have to be chained up outside. Yeah it's covered, but it's outside. And our laptops are in those bags. And the guy checking the bags is pretty rude about our concerns. So that sucks. But we get him to relent and keep our bags in the back office. 

Dude, if you hadn't charged us $3 I would have tipped you more than that. Well, not when you were being rude, so scratch that. 

At least when we came back to get our bags, they were there, nothing missing, and he was much nicer. Helpful even. 

So yeah, the rooms were not like everyone else said they were. Actually quite nice rooms. And the staff? Mostly friendly. But damn. By day three the stank in the lobby was making us queasy. And we were happy to leave. If they could fix that smell, this would be a 3 or maybe 4 star review, but honestly it was a real turn off. I hear Febreeze works pretty good. They have that in Canada, right?

Oh, and the elevators are pretty slow. 

I probably won't stay here again.",2014-09-03T03:50:47Z,59

3481,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"Stayed here for one night, booked online prior to reading the reviews and as with a previous poster had that sinking feeling once I started to read through. 

That's where the experience changed for me. The counter staff were very pleasant when we arrived. Check in was a breeze and had us on our way quickly. Once we arrived in our room it put me at ease. While the room shows its age a bit it was very clean and was perfect for a short stay especially at what I paid for the room. I must admit I've never stayed in a suite hotel and with that you do get some interesting smells when heading down the hallways but that was minimal. Currently there is no restaurant in the hotel although they are adding a Original Joes which will be a nice addition. 

I found many amenities within a short walk. Restaurants like The Keg, Earls, Yaletown Brewing. Didn't get a chance to take in a Canucks game but Rogers Arena & BC Place are 3 blocks in the other direction. 

All in all I would stay here again if I'm passing through.",2015-02-17T18:24:11Z,59
3482,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"During our recent stay in Vancouver, we picked the Rosedale on Robson because of its proximity to GM Place, where we were attending a concert.  We were not disappointed. 

For reasons unknown to me. we were upgraded to superior room.  This gave us a lovely, tucked away, corner room, with a king-sized bed, on a high floor, which made for a very relaxing environment.  Accommodations here are not fancy, but are clean and comfortable, and, for being right on a very busy street, amazingly quiet. 

The staff were all very friendly  The location, besides being close to our concert, is just steps away from Yaletown on one side and the heart of Robson street on the other. 

Things that were not really drawbacks for us, but might be to someone depending on what you are looking for:  Despite having a kitchenette in the room, there is no real eating area/table.  Also, we could only stay parked in their garage until 1:00 PM on the day we checked out. We were planning to head out of town at lunchtime anyhow, so did not really care.  BUT, most anywhere else I've ever stayed, I've been able to stay parked until much later on check-out day. 

The continental breakfast was pretty bad.  The bread was stale and they ran out of yogurt. We did not even bother.  The husband says this should cost them a star.  Instead, I only took a away half a star.  But, with the current exchange rate, three-and-a-half stars American comes out to four stars Canadian, and so they are back where they started. 

Seriously, the ""complaints"" are minor.  The Rosedale on Robson gave me a good night's sleep in a safe, convenient location and at a good price. I would definitely stay here again.",2009-04-22T04:27:54Z,59
3483,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"When I pay a good amount of money to stay at a hotel that is 20+ stories tall downtown, I assume at least the elevators work. Wrong. It took over 20 minutes on 4 separate occasions within 72 hours. (one was 40 minutes, on checkout with our luggage). I watched as 1 working elevator opened and closed full of people 7 TIMES until my wife furiously descended the stairs and I squeezed in with the bunch. Also, the pool/Jacuzzi oddly overlooks the street, so passers by can oggle you (or wife) while you are attempting to relax.

Also beware of hidden WiFi fees for *more than one device* if you are not using the hotel lobby wifi. 

So after all of this griping, why 2 stars and not 1? Location. That is all.",2015-09-08T19:22:14Z,59
3484,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"For the price in the downtown Vancouver core, you can't really expect anything better.

I actually live in the GVRD and wanted a staycation in my own city, so I decided to book a night. I know how much Vancouver hotels can cost... it isn't cheap. I wanted an affordable but comfortable stay, and read good reviews. I got a very good price through Hotels.com; it specified that I couldn't select my room until check-in, which was just fine with me. 

Check-in was friendly and helpful. Lady at the front desk needed to put a $100 hold on a credit card for any potential damages. The card didn't go through on her machine on multiple tries and ended up having to try another, but didn't miss a beat throughout. Didn't get the breakfast included in my Hotels.com booking, but the lady was very honest in saying there's plenty of great places to eat in the area (true!!)

Room on the second floor, nice big suite. No smokey smell, street-view, simple and generic hotel furnishings but very comfortable. TV in the sitting and bedroom. Bathtub and ample sink 'space' for toiletries. Quiet. Heard a few ambulances/late night calls from the street but barely anything to keep me up. Took a bath and had a good long look around the bathroom where wear and tear show most obviously - it was kept clean and no rust/cracks that I could see. 

Took the stairs up and down each time since we were only on the second floor, the one time we took the elevator (there are 3) it was speedy. 

Checkout was quick - handed back our keycards and were on our way! 

In regards to the wifi - I didn't find it painfully slow. Maybe not as fast as I'd have liked, but not impossible to get access to anything. There's also Shaw Wifi throughout the building so I switched to that if the buildings' own was being a bit sluggish. 

Would stay here again for an affordable experience. Can't beat the location - you're literally half a block from Robson, a block from the skytrain station, close to the bridge with so many restaurants in the area. When you're visiting you're only really in your room for sleeping/showering, I don't need anything too luxurious. Most of the time you're out and about. But this was a great place to rest my head after a fun time in Vancouver.",2017-01-02T05:49:29Z,59
3485,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"Our timeshare owns several units in this building. We choose it initially because of the location. Took the Amtrak up form Seattle-area. Was a quick walk from the Sky Train. 

Our room was on the 15th floor & we had a grand view of the city. Much of what we did was walking distance - taking the ferry to Granville Island, walking to/from Stanley park, Gas Town, eating, Sky Train etc.

Staff were helpful suggesting several places to eat. Rooms were clean. There was a bit of street noise, but nothing atrocious. We even used the Steam & Dry Sauna every day of our stay.

Also nice rooms for price point, only thing was the bathroom light didnt work unless the main lights were all on.. kind of annoying but good otherwise.

3488,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"I stayed here for a conference which was at the Fairmont.  

The location of the Rosedale On Robson was good, being close to Yaletown which has a trendy strip of restaurants by day, that transform into nightclubs by night. Chinatown and Granville Street are also close by. 


There's bar/lounge inside hotel called Rosie's.   

The suite we were offered had a kitchenette, hide-a-bed,living room and bedroom. Being that it was high up, it gives you a good view of the city and surrounding areas.  

I found it more expensive than other hotels I've stayed in, with extra costs of things like internet.  Although I did get a discount upon checking out. 

The train station to the airport is close enough to the hotel that you can go walk.

Left my phone charger there and they were kind enough to return it.   

I found the service somewhat a bit disorganized.

It worked for our conference, though I think I would like to try somewhere else if I was to visit Vancouver again.",2013-01-08T03:48:48Z,59

3490,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"First of all, the only reason we stayed here was because they had an indoor pool and spa that my husband wanted for our two day, one night visit to Vancouver.

We arrived, and the lady who checked us in was very nice and helpful.  She directed us to the local currency exchange place and gave us our parking pass.
We had the bell boy take our luggage upstairs to our room.  He was very nice.

The views are poor unless you like looking at other hi-rise buildings.  We reserved a King Suite.  On the reservation, I requested an ocean or mountain view.  We got a very small partial mountain view to the north between other downtown buildings.  Upon asking at the front desk, they said all King Suites are at the same part of the building, so even if they had another one available, we wouldn't get a better view.

Quiet rooms. We were a bit upset that the room is right in front of the elevator doors.  We thought the noise from the elevator use might make our stay unpleasant, but in fact, it didn't matter.  The rooms were very quiet.  We didn't hear any of our neighbors.

Horrible wi-fi.  The problem occurred when we tried to connect to their wireless internet.  We relied heavily on being able to connect while in the room so we could look things up and access our saved data (all online).  Sure, the room had free wi-fi, but with connection levels at 1 bar or less, what's the point of having it at all?  PLUS, we could only barely access the internet in the front room near the hallway, NOT at all in the bedroom where we wanted to chill out in bed and maybe watch something on the internet, like Netflix or Porn, who knows, but no matter what we wanted to watch in the bedroom, we could not, because there was no signal in the bedroom!  AND, the router in the hallway was right next to our room!  You would think we'd have a very strong connection!  The room is not that small that the connection should suck so badly.  When we inquired about the internet connection in the room being next to nothing, the lady (different from the one we registered with) tried to give us some BS about how we should NOT connect to their other wi-fi network and that we should disable Bluetooth as these things could interfere with their main wi-fi network connection.  This was BS.  We're not dummies.  She was reluctant to do anything about our problem and didn't seem to care, so we gave up on it.

The spa temperature wasn't hot enough.  The pool and spa were nice, though.  They also have both a dry and a wet sauna.

The bathroom was small.  We are both tall people (34"" inseams), and we could barely sit on the toilet because of its location with a wall right in front of it.  It was a task to get on and off the toilet.  The bathroom is the size of those found in Super 8 and Motel 6 rooms.

Like the review star rating says ""Meh.  I've experienced better."".  This place isn't worth the cost.",2016-03-15T19:39:38Z,59
3491,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"Recently stayed for some shopping, eating and a concert. Blocks from the stadium, easy walking for Robson street shopping, yummy ramen noodle restaurant around the corner. 

Cons: 
-The room temp gave me some grief... it wouldn't go lower than 68 degrees; with the warm summer days and the sun beating down the window made for an unpleasant guest. 
-The curtains in the bedroom didn't nearly block out enough of the morning light. In an attempt to adjust it, pulled to one side, more light shone thru, pull to the other side, light came thru, etc. Comical, but annoying.  
-As of 8/1 they charge $5 per device for internet. Con at the time since we were there in late July

Pros: 
-Julie, front desk staff was terrific. Same for Alex, VI staff person. Very informative, friendly and helpful.

3492,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"This ""suite"" hotel is by far one of the worst stays I've ever had the unfortunate displeasure of staying in. The rooms are filthy with stained carpets, dated 90's decor, crappy and dirty kitchenettes, tiny little TVs with terrible low-def cable that has lines going through the screen, and quite possibly the WORST housekeeping I have ever seen! We had to be moved from our first room because it was an absolute filthy mess-with smudges all over the glass wall panels which, incidentally, one had been broken and taped back on and hairs and bits of crumb ""stuffs"" all over the bedding and bathroom walls/tub, with a gross ""white stain"" right on the floor next to the bed...wonder what that was?! So they moved us to another room and, surprise surprise housekeeping had to clean that room, then come back after to change the bedding due to hairs/stains/crumbs and yes...even a dirty shoe peint on the sheet UNDER the top sheet! I spoke with the Front Desk Manager Mark who assured me that he would get in touch with the GM and have the room ""completely spotless"" in his words. The GM, who couldn't even be bothered to contact us themself, only offered us a one-night refund even though our stay in this dilapidated dingy crud-hole ruined our trip to Vancouver, as the old crappy beds they provide do not offer a good nights sleep and as a result all of us were tired, sore and grumpy! If this hotel has any pride whatsoever they would have refunded the entire stay for all of the inconveniences we had to endure! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!! There are far better places to spend $450/night than being disappointed by this godforsaken dump! Where does this money we pay to stay there go to if not towards room upkeep I ask? Probably into the pockets of management and ownership; if this place hasn't been updated since they opened up in the 90's you could imagine some wallets have grown fat without a single care as to the level of comfort their guests are provided. If ownership truly cared, they would refund the rest of my money and actually do something about the conditions in which their guests pay to stay!",2019-07-19T23:40:30Z,59
3493,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"Recently we stayed in this hotel for a week and the room we had couldn't be faulted as it was very comfortable however the service was appalling.
How this hotel won the TripAdvisor for the best hotel for the year is beyond comprehension as the lack of service was inexcusable.
First the two doormen didn't offer any assistance in helping carry the bags into the hotel from the taxi, or taking our bags to our room.
No milk provided in the fridge yet was coffee and tea making facilities, when enquiring at reception about milk was informed that I had to purchase from a store myself.
The lifts (3) took forever to arrive mainly due to staff and their linen trollies also using them thus many times the guests were squeezed hard against lift wall to accommodate house staff and linen trollies.
Surely all management had to do was lock off one lift for the purpose use of staff only?
The so called continental breakfast room was uninviting to say the least and the selection of food available was even more dismal, the hard boiled eggs were disgusting as these had been over boiled so much they were unbelievable dry and horrible.
The Hotel itself is centrally located in Vancouver which is a redeeming factor but truly lacks in many other departments to say the least, this can only lead me not to trust reviews done by TripAdvisor or how they award the Hotel of the year...",2018-08-13T20:46:24Z,59

3496,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"I stayed at this hotel 10 years ago, and I just stayed there this week. Just as good, just as courteous, fabulous, outstanding. I don't understand all the lower-than-average reviews here.

I'm not interested in five star hotels. For the value of the money, it would be a waste for me. I'm active, always out and about. For me, hotels just need to be super clean, comfortable, convenient, good customer service oriented, and designed for independent travelers.  This hotel is perfect for that type of travelers. The price was very reasonable in my opinion, in fact rather low that it got me a little worried. This hotel may be considered a 3.5 star hotel, but they don't act and treat their customers as 3.5 star customers. There are many 3.5 star hotels that are good, but they expect themselves to act as such. This one pays attention to details with care, yet they leave you alone to enjoy all you want. Just as a small example, they leave you with great coffee you can make yourself in your room whereas a 5-star hotel will make you order one at premium as room service. I don't need and want a hand-holding by a 5-star hotel concierge who may be getting a kickback from certain restaurants. I just want resources made available to me if I ever need. I'd like to do my own research.  Are you like me? Then, read on.

1) Suite is really sweet. It is really handy to have a separate room from the bedroom where you can have a little space to yourself from your family/friends traveling together. Both the living room and the bedroom has its own TV and phone. Handy.

2) Kitchenette is complete. Small, but complete with stove, oven, microwave, coffee maker, hot water boiling pot, refrigerator, dishes, dish towels, utensils, you name it. All spic and span clean. Even though we didn't cook, we sure used the microwave, fridge, coffee maker, hot water pot, and it made us at home.

3) Clean, clean, clean. After 10+ years, I expected it to be a bit aged and perhaps dingy -- NOT. Very impressed with how they kept it up.

4) Indoor swimming pool, hot tub, steam and dry sauna. I used them everyday, and again, clean and very well kept. It was nice to jump in the steam room and relax after a day of lots of walking around.  They close the facility for a couple of hours mid day everyday for cleaning and maintenance. It shows. Having this facility is a big plus for me.

5) Amazingly courteous and friendly staff, period.

6) Book directly with the hotel, and you'll be given a complimentary continental breakfast. Nothing too fancy, however, the quality of the continental breakfast was far better than some others I've seen in recent years of my traveling. 

7) Location is perfect that it's an easy walking distance to the heart of Robson, Yaletown, Gas Town, Downtown. You can catch Aqua Bus, a little boat to cross the water to go to Granville Island and other locations from Yaletown. Car2Go lots are nearby as well. Although it stands at the corner of Robson and Hamilton, it's not in the middle of the busiest Robson street, so that it is rather quiet at night which is perfect. Lots of lots of little eateries as well as more major restaurants around the hotel.

We didn't drive this time, but the parking is something like $16 in the building/day which I think very reasonable.  WiFi at the lobby is free and was good.  WiFi in the room is complimentary for one device. You'd need to pay for additional. (well, this is the only 'too bad' I felt, but we were fine with just one device being able to have WiFi, and it wasn't slow as some have mentioned. I believe it depends on the room location)

Will I stay again? Without a doubt, this is THE hotel I'll keep on using in Vancouver.",2014-10-27T19:40:20Z,59
3497,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"I read all the reviews on here and thought it looked like a nice place to stay, so I booked us for all 9 nights we were in Vancouver. They gave us a discounted rate for staying so long (I think it was corporate rate) but I realized that didn't include wifi so I called and they comped the internet since we'd be staying so long. When we arrived we were told that only one device was covered for wifi and it would be an additional $15/day per device. My boyfriend does this (networks) for work, and that's the whole reason for the visit. Since I'm staying with him I need to entertain myself while he's at work and I use the internet for that. So we need at least 2 devices, and that's before our tablets and 3rd laptop. We got to the room and the internet was shotty, we had to keep putting in the password. If they are charging $15/day/device, you'd think they'd be able to afford the best of the best, highest speed internet. But after the first day, we discovered this was absolutely not the case when the internet went out. We couldn't log on at all, and when we called the desk they said ""maybe it will be fixed tomorrow"",, tomorrow came and it was ""maybe tonight"" but the bf had some coworkers coming in to join him & stay in the same hotel. We all cancelled our reservations and went to Georgian Court (which was great). They were allowing guests to use wired internet at their single kiosk for 15 minutes at a time but the line was full of angry guests...it was not pleasant waiting in line to find a new hotel.
That's not all, the kitchens are from the 50's- completely metal and grimy. Our fridge wasn't working so we had to ask someone to come show us how to turn it on. Being so old it was hard to figure out the little plug in the back controls the temperature. 
The beds were hard, but I don't mind that usually. These were bad though. The carpets were gross & grimy and the bathroom was too small for 2 people. There were no full length mirrors and the lighting was bad. 
The breakfast was decent at least. Fruit, muffins coffee & tea-continental breakfast. But the exercise room was pitiful. I thought it was a storage room when we arrived, but when I went to use it, yikes. It is on the ground level, with window walls looking out to the driveway where people and taxis come & go. There were a couple of outdated machines, one was unplugged and ""out of service"" sign was on it. 
There were white stains on the curtains (I can only imagine) and what looked like vomit stains on the carpet. This would be an ok place to stay (for less money) if you were going to a game or just wanted to party and were leaving the next day. And didn't have to shower. 
The shower curtains are really cheap and suck in while you shower, so you have to push them out or put weights on them. This results in a flood every time you shower and there isn't enough space in the bathroom to hold all the towels you will need to use to mop up. 
It feels like everything in this hotel came from a garage sale. There wasn't even any stuffing left in the couch. It's gross, I would never stay here again unless it was free. Even then only maybe. 
At least the staff was friendly and accommodating. I almost feel bad leaving such a bad review. The owner should stop being stingy with the money you charge people and splurge on quality furniture, flooring, internet, etc. Stop buying from old estate sales.",2012-11-18T20:36:46Z,59

3500,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"My buddy and I stayed here the weekend of 02/15-02/17 for a weekend of hockey and nightlife. 

Overall the hotel is what it is (and you should know it by the price) which is not the grandest or the most upscale but a three to four star casual friends and family suite hotel 

The location is awesome as EVERYTHING is in walking distance (except for Stanley Park). You've got Yaletown, the Hockey arena, Granville St, Robson and Gastown all within walking or stumbling distance.

The room was decent as it featured comfortable beds, two flat-screens and an average bathroom. My only complaint is I had an ""Deluxe Superior Suite"" that did not have a couch in the living but two very uncomfortable chairs. 

It's a hotel that is good for a guys/girls weekend or family stays however as a couple maybe a nicer place would be a better fit. But for what it is, I will return sometime....

3501,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"The only reason they're getting two stars instead of one is because of the location of the hotel.  It's very close to all of the action in Downtown and a short walk to a couple of the other neighborhoods like Yaletown and Chinatown.  
Besides location some other positives would be the cleanliness of the room and comfort of the bed.
Now on to the negatives.  First, I reserved a room with a king size bed for two nights with my girlfriend.  We get there and told they gave our room away BUT don't worry...we've been upgraded FOR FREE to a room on a higher floor with two double beds.   I tried to explain to the guy numerous times I have zero interest in a higher floor as my girlfriend and I will be sharing 1 double bed now instead of a king.  After a few attempts at trying to persuade us into this new room he finally said he might be able to get us a queen bed.  He was able to and because I was obviously not going to get what I paid for (a king size bed) I took the room.  We were then given a parking pass for their parking garage and we were off on our way.  Except, the garage was completely full so we spent 15 minutes driving around that thing for no reason.  We ended up having to park the car in their taxi waiting area and having valet park the car for us later that night.
To end the review, if you value customer service and honesty from a business you're dealing with, do not get a room at the Rosedale.  There are plenty of other hotels in Vancouver and I for one will be checking into one of them the next time I come visit.",2012-11-17T23:33:55Z,59
3502,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"Great location.  The facility is mediocre. Don't stay here expecting the Four Seasons.  We stayed in the Rosedale Condos.  Rooms were OK.  Air con was working.  Bed felt comfy enough.  We spent most of the time walking around so the only time we were in the room was to sleep.

3504,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"This is the last hotel for our trip.  We stayed in a condo and they didn't provide much, and did not clean the room our entire stay.  Gave us tiny bar of soap, super difficult elevator but great area.  Would have rather stayed at The Westin nearby.",2013-06-29T21:42:52Z,59
3505,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"We did get a decent price since we went on Hotwire (via a site called Better Bidding) and did the hotel equivalent of Mystery Date (TM).  At that price, it was very reasonable.  We would not have stayed if we would have paid the on-hotel site price of C$199 + tax.  (Another hotel site lists a mystery size room for US$149 per night, which was still more than we paid with tax.)

One reviewer disapproved of the view, which, being downtown, comprises a lot of tall buildings.  1. To be expected.  2.  Who wouldn't want to look at the different types of downtown Vancouver architecture?

The lobby was quite dated and a bit dirty.  The color scheme somewhat reminded me of a Greyhound Bus station.  Something bothered my allergies.  I thought it might be because the Hotwire listing said ""pet-friendly"" - and the last time I stayed in a pet-friendly hotel, I had severe hayfever bordering on asthma the entire time.  Oddly, however, there were absolutely no pets and the hotel literature mentioned that pets were banned as of some date in 2013.

We got a king bed suite on the 20th floor.  This does mean a separate bedroom, which, although we were by ourselves, we appreciated.  And while the carpet was a bit dirty (some minor staining, mainly), the room smelled clean.  The bed was a bit hard, but comfortable. No eau de BO, either, in our sheets (as another reviewer remarked).  The soft pillows were exceptional and contributed to a restful night's sleep.  We heard very little noise from outside and almost none from neighboring rooms or the hallway, despite the fact that we were right across from the elevators.  The robes really are a one size fits all - both hubby and I were actually able to fasten ours completely with no problem - and are very comfortable.  We absolutely adored the patio outside (accessible both from the bedroom and living room) and only wished it weren't raining so we could have had our coffee and croissants (purchased from a very nice albeit a bit pricey croissant shop immediately next door to the left as you leave the hotel) out there.

Unfortunately, we didn't have time to use the sauna, jacuzzi, or little lap pool.  But they're there - and indoors.

Parking, with tax, was a little over C$20 per day, which was relatively reasonable.  Be aware, however, that you need a credit card (not just a debit card) and that C$100 is withheld for 2 business days after your stay - even if you've already paid in advance.  Bigger bummer (from what I surmised) is that if you don't have the extra money because you've paid for the room or for whatever reason, then you cannot check in.

Hubby liked it better than The Canadian, where we usually stay because we have a timeshare there.",2016-04-24T22:02:08Z,59

3507,Rosedale on Robson Suite Hotel,3.2,"Inconsistent service from staff, ranging from friendly and helpful to indifferent or downright sarcastic and incompetent. 

I don't imagine our experience to be the norm but it is the reason for my low rating.

My wife and I stayed for three weeks during which time we had to move rooms twice in a 24 hour period. Our first room change happened after I arrived home from work one evening at 11pm to find my wife standing on a flooded carpet. She was told by staff that a honeymooning couple in the room above got a little playful and splashed some water on the bathroom floor which must've leaked down through the walls and into our room. My wife requested a room change which was denied. Instead, fans were brought into the room to dry the carpet. When the wetness continued to spread into the remainder of the hotel room the staff admitted to a problem and we were given a different room. Between midnight and 1am we moved our belongings. Once in our new room we were informed that it was temporary as it was a time-share and as we understood was under different ownership and/or management. We were therefore moved again the next morning - our third room. I wonder if the lack of sleep and stress of that evening contributed to my suffering an injury on the job the next afternoon. Hmm. It's possible. In any case, we received a fruit basket from the hotel management for the trouble - a nice gesture.

The front door is locked and you have to call the front desk to ask them to open it.   Or if they see you they will let you in.  I was immediately greeted by the friendly staff and welcomed.  Check in was easy and seamless.  The front desk people explained everything clearly.  There's a code on the door to get in and out.  Parking is at the back,  It is safe with plenty of lights and cameras.  I left my luggage in the car overnight and staff said they have not heard of any incident of theft.  I parked my car close to the entrance as well.  If you are not comfortable leaving your belongings in the car then you can bring it to your room.  I had a very heavy luggage that's why I didn't feel lugging it around in a flight of stairs.  No elevator by the way.  The front desk is open until 12 am.  There are 2 complimentary bottled water in my room.   There's free refills beside the front desk as well as free snacks like popcorn, banana, pop tarts, hot tea, etc.  The room is clean and decent.  It is simple.  Room comes with cable tv, small fridge, microwave, and steamer.  Next door has a gym and I believe for hotel guests there's just a $5 fee to gain access each time.   Nearby there are 2 pizza places, and a sushi restaurant.  You will need a car if you want more options to eat or coffee.  I'm giving this five stars for what it is, clean and friendly service by the staff.

3513,Queens Hotel,3.3,"I was in the area for a few days and wanted to be close to a jobsite nearby, but I really didn't want to deal with downtown parking or staying out by the airport. I have to say this is the first time I stayed at a hotel in a strip mall and I was fearing the worst when I first arrived. 

That all changed when I walked inside. I was greeted by a very friendly host and the place was very nice, it was obvious it had just been renovated. In fact I think I saw Anthony Melchiorri driving away as I pulled up.

The room was small but I'll take small and clean over large and gross any time. The bed and linens were brand new, new hardgoods covered the floor, removing any questions about what could be living in that carpet. The bathroom and shower were brand new and done in real tile, not sheet plastic or vinyl. Fresh paint and all new woodwork covered the walls.

I had a chance to chat with the owner when I checked out and enjoyed him sharing the history of the place as a Hell's Angles hangout in a previous life. He explained that the entire neighborhood was undergoing revitalization and Enjoy your stay!that he had to think long and hard about spending so much money on the place. Personally I think he did the right thing. It's quaint clean hotel with nice rates and nice people.

This eclectic hotel truly provided us with an indigenous experience by showcasing aboriginal art on the hotels property. The lodge also had an indigenous art gallery in its main lobby. My wife and I felt good about staying here because we knew that it supported Vancouver's Native Housing Society's mission and financial sustainability. It was also interesting to see how urban indigenous artists resided in this hotel as their artist in residence. The art on the walls of the hotel rooms truly got you engaged with the indigenous way of life. If you are an eclectic traveler who wants a hotel that truly supports an amazing mission, than Skwachay's Lodge is the right one for you.

Aside from their mission, their breakfast was quite amazing. Everything on their menu was homemade. From danishes and muffins, to yogurt parfaits, we truly felt that everything was super fresh and that we were receiving amazing quality. One thing to note is their location can be a bit off putting. It's close to downtown, however, it's recommended you take cabs to and from the hotel, given the neighborhood. You will truly get the Vancouver experience outside of touristy downtown.

3524,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,"I'm going to school for art history, so this for sure sways my opinion on this hotel--and not for the better. Upon reading reviews and seeing pictures, I was led to believe this place was going to be an artistic experience with inviting art that wraps you up in its arms; I was sorely disappointed in that. The gallery is more of a gift shop, not clean walls and open space that showcases art like a typical gallery would.

I had an animal themed room and all I had was some tree wallpaper and only two tribal masks (one of which was shoved awkwardly too close to those corner of the room). And it didn't even stretch into the bathroom-there was little design in there. The mirror size and lighting was amazing, but the lack of counter space was very frustrating, but what was only because I needed space for makeup and a curling iron. 

I also have to say the TV and cable was frustrating. The hotel doesn't do a good job at keeping up to date on the condition of their technology because many buttons on the remote in my room were broken. 

The location this place is in was my least favorite I've been in. There are homeless people and druggies everywhere for a few blocks in both directions. I only stayed here since it was close to Rogers Arena. I was only a block or two away from this place when I saw a homeless man try and grab a young woman's butt, which shook me up.

After checking in, the front desk agent met us around back to show us how to park the car. The lobby is also a part of an art gallery which was cool. Our room was on the 5th floor and our stay was pretty quiet and relaxing. Our room even had a balcony! The complimentary breakfast is also amazing! The blueberry muffins were definitely my fave. :P Although the lodge was located in a sketchy location (Ill explain in a bit) there were many restaurants and bars nearby, which made looking for food that much more convenient. 

Now for the reason why I took off a star(and if I could, a half), the area surrounding this lodge is really sketchy. As another yelper said, there were quite a few zombies (druggies) roaming around the street. The alley way that you take to get to the parking structure, is usually blocked off by bums, which frustrated me a few times because they would not move even when I approached them in a car. On one of our days while leaving the hotel, my girlfriend and I witnessed a man peeing behind a dumpster which really creeped out my girlfriend. I wouldn't walk around at night because of how sketchy the area is.

All in all, if it wasn't in such a sketchy location I would totally recommend this hotel. Instead I would probably pay a little extra to stay at the Pinnacle at the Pier across the bay.",2017-10-19T02:51:05Z,29
3527,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,"I was in Vancouver for one night  but after staying at the lodge, I wish I had planned for a longer stay!

The hotel is on the border of the largest Chinatown in North America and the historic district of Gastown. Those who are not used to city life may feel uneasy but I felt the location was perfect for exploring fantastic restaurants, interesting bars and attending hockey games. 

The lodge hosts a beautiful gallery with Aboriginal art made by Aboriginal artists. As an added bonus, First Nation artists have their living and studio spaces subsided by the proceeds of the hotel. I love that this hotel has a purpose and interacts with the community. 

I stayed in the delightfully roomy Canadiana Suite which featured a TV room, a bedroom with a kitchenette (microwave, fridge, coffee pot, water heater, and glassware), and a full bath. 

Note that the hotel is small with only 18 rooms and limited front desk hours. They have a delicious complementary breakfast and extremely cheap pre-reserved parking. I have paid over $70 for overnight parking in San Fran so $18 a night is a steal. If you require parking, I recommend that you park in front of the hotel for check-in.

3528,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,"First, I'm going to start off by saying that the amazing thing about this place are the people who work there.  Maggie, in particular, was phenomenally professional, courteous, and helpful :)  As such, the low star review has nothing to do with the staff of this Lodge.

OK, where to begin?  There are several reasons I am giving this Lodge a 1-star review.

1. Dangerous area. I'm sorry, but there's no arguing that this is a scary area.  By the way, I have lots of experience traveling, as well as living in dangerous downtown areas (when I was younger), and I feel very comfortable in most areas (and countries) that other people are not comfortable in.  This being said, you have to do your own research, as there's so much conflicting on these reviews, and I'd expect you would be confused why this is suddenly a ONE star review amongst the majority of other, glowing 4 & 5 star reviews.

BUT READ FOR YOURSELF, at the Bureau of Diplomatic Security Website by the United States government:  

https://www.osac.gov/pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=19819

Here's a direct quote from this website: 

""Other Areas of Concern -- Generally, the east-side corridor of downtown Vancouver should be avoided. While areas near East Hastings Street and Main Street are filled with attractive boutiques and restaurants, individuals fueling drug addictions are also present and steal/sell items to support their habits.""

Now, I'd like to remind you that this intersection (East Hastings & Main Street) is less than THREE blocks from Skwachays Lodge.

2. The rooms are really tiny, and I felt claustrophobic.  There is actually a sort of ""counter"" built into the foot-area of the bed to try to compensate for lack of counter space.

3. Our room had NO privacy curtain on the windows.  Just curtains that black out the light 100%.  Thus, the choice was between darkness and zero privacy.  Oh, and outside the window was the whole side of an apartment complex, with peoples' windows and balconies literally an easy stone's throw away....  Really, no privacy.

4. This place gets the award for the slowest elevator that operates on electricity, lol.

5. Parking!  -- To get to your car, you have to walk outside, around the front of the place, around the side, and then into the alley in the back.  In daytime it's not so scary, but at night time--yikes!  There were drug addicts shooting up, and ANGRY criminals and troublemakers (the kind that accost you and harass you, and who might assault you) between me and the garage door...   That's correct, there is NO access to the parking garage from the inside of this ""lodge"" - you have to walk outside...

6. Cancellation policy - Yes, I know a 24-hour cancellation policy is the norm.  But, after we spent ONE night here, and experienced how dangerous it was, we decided to cancel the rest of our nights there (our safety is more important than artwork).  So, Monday morning we cancelled the rest of our nights, but they still charged us for Monday evening.  I truly feel that if I were in charge of this place, I would have refunded that night as well, since the cancellation was due to safety reasons.

7. Overall quality-to-price ratio is way off.  After we left, we went to another place (HINT!  If you go just 3 or 4 blocks to the west, the area clears up SIGNIFICANTLY, and we found an INCREDIBLY awesome hotel to stay at (spacious, elegant, high-class... I can't rave enough about it, but hey, that's another review, right?)) for just $15 more per night.  I'd say the place we ended up at was 20X better, for only a little bit more $$.  The other place was so incredible, that we will stay there next time we come to Vancouver.

FINAL CONCLUSION - Slow elevators, tiny rooms, and lack of privacy curtains aside, the main issue here is SAFETY.  How much do you value yours?  Are you willing to take the risk?  Perhaps you should ask a local (who does not have a conflict of interest - such as a bus driver) before you decide on ANY place to stay in Vancouver...",2017-04-20T04:49:33Z,29
3529,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,"This is a tough one for me to rate - definitely a 3.5, tipped into a 4 by great service and a nice breakfast! Yes, it's in Chinatown, it's not dangerous but it can get a little loud in the evening sometimes.

We had a lovely check in experience (you go into the art shop to check in, FYI!) and I found the staff super friendly throughout our stay. Our room was cute, clearly still very new, and I LOVE that they're all decorated by First Nations artists! There's even a whole sheet telling you about the artist when you come in! 

The room was small but comfortable, and the bed was big and comfortable! The bathroom didn't have a ton of counter space, but we made it work. The thermostat didn't work, but on our second day I realised that there was an AC unit in the room which was great because it was HOT! 

My only complaint is that the room hadn't been dusted - it's a small thing but it was noticeable on the walls etc.

The free breakfast was a lovely addition, and they had some really cute yogurt parfaits, as well as bannock on the first day! Yay!

Worth checking out, but please do make sure you dust the rooms thoroughly, Skwachays!",2016-03-03T01:30:16Z,29
3530,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,Super friendly and helpful. The rooms were great and the bathrobes are awesome. The gallery has beautiful art and it is great to get to meet artists in residence sometimes. Top of my list for travel to Vancouver and great to support  Indigenous artists and a local housing society.,2020-10-15T03:20:42Z,29
3531,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,"For my first-ever visit to Vancouver, and traveling alone, I wanted to stay somewhere special and non-cookie-cutter. I got my wish -- and more -- with Skwachays. My room (""Moon"") was spacious, clean, comfortable, and distinctively decorated. The front-desk staff was personable, thoughtful, and helpful. I loved strolling through the gallery to the elevator, and then chatting with some of the resident artists in that elevator. (That sort of encounter wouldn't happen at a corporate-chain hotel.) The breakfast buffet was outstanding: homemade yogurt in little Mason jars, petite quiches, freshly made breads, fresh fruit. Many thanks to Maggie for the fabulous repasts!

Despite some of the negative reviews here, I *loved* the location. I wouldn't want to trivialize  Vancouver's homelessness problem, but I've seen far worse in California's major cities. I loved being able to walk to Chinatown and Gastown, and Skwachays is directly across the street from one of the venues of the Vancouver International Film Festival (VIFF), which was one of the reasons for my visit. Within hours I felt at home in Vancouver, and much of the credit goes to Skwachays. I hope to return soon!",2017-10-09T21:08:35Z,29
3532,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,"The staff is super friendly, the hotel is nice. I am giving it a 4 star because the neighborhood does seem a bit dodgy and because of the stairs as soon as you enter the room.

Really, this hotel would be easy to miss, but you should check it out for at least one night, it is a full  place and the staff is very nice.

Their recommendation to go to Caveman across the street was spot on, the food was delicious, inexpensive and unprocessed. Oh and serving portions are gigantic. It should prove that healthy food can be made to be filling and affordable. Definitely check them out if you stay here.

But the hotel is beautiful and very quiet, at least for us. Given how environmentally friendly they are, it would be nice if their showers had temperature mixing valves so that the water wouldn't turn on until it comes up to temperature, which would help to save water as it does take a little while to get hot water.

Parking is a bit strange here, but it does at least make it fairly secure.",2016-06-02T14:36:29Z,29
3533,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,"The hotel itself is super cute and the staff is really nice. I feel really bad for this review but it is very true to our experience. We stayed here for one night over Memorial Day Weekend. The biggest thing I was concerned about was the location/neighborhood. 

The building was fairly hidden and it looked like a hostel from the outside. You check in at the Art Gallery and you get back in your car to meet the front desk agent in the ""alley"" to get into the hotel parking lot through 2 garage doors. Once you're parked, you walk out of the garage (not through stairs or anything butt where the car drives) and leave through the huge garage door then down the alley a few doors down to get into the ""back door"".
This set up was too much for me and there were a lot of ""zombies"" (druggies in the alley). It was a well lit alley but I still wouldn't recommend this set up if staying here by your self or a bunch of girls. 

During our stay, it was quite short but there was a lot of noise, I believe half of the building are tenants and half are hotel guests? Something like that but there seemed to be a lot of parties and noise going on in this property. It didn't bother us as we knocked out from drinking but I can imagine the noise to be bothersome for others.",2015-05-25T18:15:36Z,29
3534,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,"What an awesome place!

I just happened across this place on a travel web site.  The price was very reasonable for it's location, so I was skeptical.  I have stayed in many different places in Vancouver and this is by far my favorite.  

Everything is brand spankin new, so that was a real bonus for the price!  It's 3 blocks from the trendy gastown, across the street from an international shopping area with a huge variety of food court places, 3 blocks from the SkyTrain, an $8 cab ride from Canada Place (cruise terminal) and a $6 cab ride from the Amtrak station. Did I say it was a perfect location?  Seriously!

Are their homeless people in the area? yes.  Is that pretty much everywhere downtown except robson street in vancouver? yes.  It's urban life.  Certainly does not deter from the bargain and the fabulousness of this place.

The Scoop:  The place is about 1 year old.  The web site was very confusing to me and I couldn't quite pinpoint what exactly it was.  I read other reviews and since it's concept was so foreign to me, I worried that it might be a YMCA type homeless shelter/hostel /hotel like NY.  It is nothing like that!  This place has style and class and is GENIUS!

Style: It's a center for Native American artists.  Their art is displayed and sold in the lobby gallery.  The gallery works are spectacular.  The rooms are all brand new and very comfortable.  We had a corner room and it was quite spacious.

The GENIUS:  The center houses 25 artists.  The top floor is the hotel.  So, when you ride the elevator you are likely  to meet one of the artists.  I must say I was bummed that the elevator ride was so short!  The artists we met were very  talkative and informative.  You can really ""feel the love"" in this place.  It's an artists community where boring folks like me get to mingle and be a part of a creative community!  I understand why it's called a ""healing lodge"".... the positive vibes in this place are abundant.

I say this is Genius because travelers like me get to stay at a great place, pay decent (if not discounted comparatively speaking) price, and support local artists all at the same time.  Think about this!  You can either give your money to folks like Paris Hilton or  you can support local artists and a great community.  This is a genius idea and I wish there was a place like this in every city!

Bravo Skwachays!  I will always stay here when I visit Vancouver!  Bravo!",2013-05-13T05:20:56Z,29
3535,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,"This is the last time I book a hotel without READING the reviews first. (I normally just look at the overall ratings, which DID NOT prepare me for this place.)

First of all, we couldn't even find the place, because the entrance to the hotel is through this little hole-in-the-wall gallery. When I called for directions, the person I spoke to on the phone assured me I was on the wrong side of Pender (E. Pender vs. W. Pender), even though I wasn't. Then, when we finally got to the hotel and checked in at the desk, the person there tried to charge me the entire amount of our stay - including the $250+ that was pre-paid through Hotels.com. (Also, parking is extra, and their lot is super limited so be prepared for that.)

When we finally got to our room, we found that it was super small and very bare-bones. The bed has just a regular metal frame, the TV is a giant tube set that hums loudly when you turn it on, and the windows and balcony were unusable because they looked directly into other people's residences (all of which were within 30 feet of us). Housekeeping was awkward the next morning, as they don't give you ""do not disturb"" signs to put out, so I had not one, but two people try to come into the room while I was getting dressed, and had to yell at them through the door that we were fine and didn't need our bed made.

With that said, the room, though small, was clean, and was fine for just sleeping. If you're planning to be out and about in downtown the whole time you stay here, I think this place is probably fine. But if you plan to spend any amount of time in your room (which we expected to do at least a bit of, since this was our anniversary weekend), I don't recommend this place.",2013-09-10T21:05:26Z,29
3536,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,"The lodge is absolutely lovely. 
Decorated in aboriginal theme throughout the whole lodge and rooms which creates a very beautiful and calming atmosphere.      Although the building has 6 floors, only 2 are used for hotel guests.   The remaining floors are occupied by the ""artists in residence"" who rent a bachelor space at the hotel.    Those same artists are the artists whose work is on display and for sale in the gallery at the reception.   The most stunning art.    Prices vary, it's not the place to buy a cheap souvenir to take home: this is true art.    The breakfast room is small and more for a quick coffee and small bite.   Proper silverware and crockery and nothing of that styrofoam stuff often finds in hotels.   Good tea brands and a nice variety available!   Big thumbs up for that one!    One needs a hotel room key to enter the hotel and use elevator after 7pm which is good and safe.   Room has a safe, microwave, coffee machine and separate water kettle.    Nice beds, fluffy duvet, good mattresses.    Our room had no view: we looked right into the rooms of a neighboring apartment so we kept curtains closed.    The location, although Gas Town and bordering China Town (the gate is literally 2 minute walk) 
It's sketchy to say the least.    Vancouver has approximately 2500 homeless people.  Now don't get me wrong: homeless doesn't necessarily mean people are aggressive.   In this area there are many addicts, maybe schizophrenic, maybe alcoholic.  It's not pleasant part of town.    We didn't come back to hotel after 9pm but I wouldn't feel particularly safe here.    I would most definitely not like to park my car here overnight!     Having said that: walk 2 blocks and you'll see a fun part of town with less homeless.  
needless to say hotel prices will go up as well.",2017-04-26T17:27:59Z,29

3539,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,Great location and tremendous staff. Room was beautiful and very comfortable. I'd say here every time I come to Vancouver.,2018-12-04T04:42:50Z,29
3540,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,"Loved it! 
Where to start:
1. The staff were friendly and fantastic. 
2. The rooms are beautifully done. Ours was themed ""The Moon"" and we liked the big ""rock"" pillows and detailing on the ceiling and walls, and the unique platform our bed was on. Big giant puffy pillows. Mini fridge and microwave. Flatscreen TV. Ipod dock. All good. Love the wood table. Just every detail was perfect. 
3. location: close to gastown, science world. downtown, seabus, skytrain, and all points. Close to grocery, restaurants, a pharmacy. 
4. Love that we had a chance to stay at a hotel with a mission, and I wish them every success.  Its a hotel/residence, but it was not the least bit an issue. I did forget to see the 6th floor deck. oops! 

Room size is about average, even spacious, Ive stayed in far tinier hotel rooms, my family who joined us and stayed elsewhere had a far smaller room than us. It fit two adults, luggage, stroller and toddler just fine ( no cribs, so plan accordingly for the small traveller in your group.) 

I will say, for people unfamiliar with vancouver, the neighborhood can be...colorful. A bit alarming even, but we never had an issue. We used to live in the area, so I guess it doesn't bother me much. ( hint: the residents won't bother you if you don't bother them.). It's safe. Our suite overlooked an inner courtyard, but again, quiet, and lovely. 

This is now my preferred hotel for Vancouver. Highly recommend.",2015-08-05T19:26:55Z,29
3541,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,"Wow! Didn't even stay. It took us forever to find the place and the streets all around the hotel were filled with drug addicts.   We wanted to be near Gastown and walk around in the evening but clearly we would be taking our lives in to our hands to do so.   We cancelled and were charged the full room rate but there was no way I was going to stay there,  we cut our losses and left  we are now comfortably checked into the Pinnacle Harbour front Hotel and it is beautiful!",2015-10-21T00:15:26Z,29
3542,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,"The friendly staff and uniquely decorated lobby/art gallery and rooms made our stay great.

3543,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,"Very odd hotel experience. The room itself was very clean, but extremely small. That much is expected downtown, but there was a complete lack of service.  We called down at 7 PM to request more pillows, left a voicemail. and never heard back. It didn't feel like a real hotel, more like a little guest room in someone's apartment building.  It gets two stars for a great location, it's only saving grace.",2013-10-23T17:06:29Z,29
3544,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,"Having just returned from a weekender in Vancovuer for what was apparently an ""event"" weekend that meant insanely high hotel rates throughout the city. However, this is where the Skwachàys Healing Lodge really saved my bacon, because they popped up with availability at the last minute for a much more reasonable rate than any number of shoddy hotels were offering. And this place is by no means shoddy (although it is very close to skid road). Simple, but very clean rooms, a cool art gallery, and a great Ronald McDonald house-type service provided to Canadian aboriginal people. It's the last part that makes this place a by definition ""last minute"" booking, because this place serves visiting patients first. That said, it was no problem for us, and the Gastown location was perfect for our purposes. The only drawbacks would be the sheets/towels, which are scratchy (and slightly bleached-smelling) and the lack of area parking. But these are minor drawbacks. I would definitely come back here.",2012-10-01T00:49:35Z,29
3545,Skwachàys Lodge Hotel and Gallery,3.9,"Stayed here for the first time while attending Bon Jovi concert. BTW, about a block away to Rogers Arena! Everything is very close to this hotel. McDonalds, Tim Horton's, Cineplex. I was impressed with the location. There are homeless people near by, but it is Vancouver, there is going to be :) Did not have any issue with people. The security is very good. There is underground parking (only 7 spaces) which you need to call and reserve if you wish to get a space. $15.00 each day you wish to park. The security for the parking is grand. The entrance is located in a small alley, but no worries there. The two days we were there, we ran into no troubles. The back door into the hotel is locked and a large light above the door. Cannot enter ANY door in the hotel without your pass. Cannot even use the elevator without one. The room was clean and spacious. The beds were comfortable. For me, not too hard nor soft. Our room was two double beds. There is a nice big bathroom, shower, sink and of course toilet. There is a small kitchenette with a fridge. No microwave. There is in room coffee. (back to the parking - there is no luggage cart, so if you bring much luggage, this might be slightly annoying) The hotel staff were super friendly. We were not in our room much, so for us, this was perfect. Perfect location, perfect price for the location and security made us feel even better.",2013-10-05T01:29:52Z,29
