0,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,Love this place. Reasonable daily fee and water was in great condition. Some lane business however easy to get in an go as circle swimming is the norm. Wish I could go here every day!,2022-06-21T03:42:18Z,30
1,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"I went swimming here yesterday and accidentally left my only shorts on the bench in the changing room after my swim. After calling as soon as I got home and then calling 15 times the next day, not once did they pick up, straight to machine that hangs up with no message option. 
Frustrated, I drove there today after work and after calling over and over throughout the day (within 23 hours of leaving them there) and I waited outside until a janitor came past the door, he went and got a staff member who then apparently looked in the room and then withhin minutes he told me that they don't keep lost-and-found they just throw left items away.

Pretty pissed off to say the least. Not only did you throw my belongings out, you never answered any of my calls to give me any chance of retrieving them. 

I will never go back, also the pool is gross it's the worst in the city.",2020-12-15T01:13:35Z,30
2,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"I joined at the same time i started on Jenny Craig. One goes hand in hand if your serious about losing weight (for me at least )

This pool is close to my condo downtown featuring the water work outs i was looking for.

 I personally love the deep water which are Tues and Thurs at 1pm and Sunday at 4 pm .

I have gone to the moderate aqua fit in the shallow end in the mornings,  but didn't like it as much until i went to a Wed evening 7 pm class that ROCKED!!! 
 I plan on adding that to my weekly class schedule. 

My only complaint is that one of the instructors plays THE SAME CD of Latin themed music which i personally cannot stand. 

The change rooms also are a bit gross and the hot tub is kinda small and dimly lit. But overall its helped me lose 20 pounds so far!",2010-04-01T19:17:12Z,30
3,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,I go to the Vancouver Aquatic centre every week. I have been wanting to learn how to swim for many years now and as an adult it's a hard thing to start doing. I recently started classes elsewhere - since the classes here were always full and I have been on the wait list multiple times. I do come here to practice my swimming since their drop in rates are reasonable. The facilities are dated and could use a little upgrade. The price is what makes it feasible for a novice swimmer like myself.,2018-07-17T21:01:32Z,30
4,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"My neighbourhood pool.
It's not fancy. It's a dated building, but what more do you want? It's a pool.
Admission is dirt cheap and public swim times are plentiful and convenient. 
Change rooms are always clean. Staff are helpful and laid back.
The kiddie pool is nice and warm and at it's deepest it's only 2.5' deep, makes a great little spot for the wee ones to splash and play. It's a great option for the kids when the weather is crappy.",2015-03-30T22:47:32Z,30
5,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,The best swimming experience one can have! 50-m standard pool with sufficient space for everyone! The lanes are split by speed. Canadians swim fast!!,2018-04-15T02:35:39Z,30
6,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"Friends and I came here for long distance swim training. This pool is a 50-meter pool. We were very happy about getting there in time for their discounted prices (Generally, 6 Canadian dollars per person, but that Saturday after 1PM only 3 Canadian per person)

When we got ready to swim, there were lanes that already marked with different speed. Both my friends were in the medium speed lane and I was in the slow speed lane. In slow lane, people were mellow and relaxed. I actually swam over someone who was on his backstroke! After a while, I just had to swam pass those mellow people! :P 3 of us finished 4000 meters within 2 hours that day! Confidence booster for all of us.

Shower facility was clean. You bring your own shampoo and stuff, which is fair for the amount of money we paid. The only thing was, free parking is impossible in the neighborhood (well, we were from Seattle. I only lopped a couple times around. Eventually, we parked right next to the pool and paid for parking. I believe it's about 10 Canadian dollars for entire day)

We are planning to come back again (if our pool in Federal Way is not available). We will possibly check the 50-meter outdoor pool too.",2015-03-25T16:47:02Z,30
7,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,Woman at the check-in counter was one of the rudest people I've met in a long time.  Place was dirty and pool was cold.  Will never return.,2017-07-10T05:51:03Z,30
8,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"I go here about once a week. With the HST now in effect the drop in price is currently $6.75, which isn't bad at all considering it's $15 at most private gyms, including the YMCA. 

The pool is Olympic size, with a smaller pool connected to it, making for a tetris-esque shape. While doing laps you're quite likely to see either the water polo team practicing, the dive team doing their thing, or an aquafit class. 

The width of the pool is actually 21 meters, not 25. If you're serious about doing laps, this can be frustrating. 

The major week point of the place is its workout center. It can get VERY crowded, and much of the equipment is pretty worn down.",2010-07-17T16:18:30Z,30
9,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"After living in the West End for over ten years, I finally went to the Vancouver Aquatic Centre this week.
I have been going to aquafit classes at Brittania with friends but we decided to try something a little closer to home this time.
The instructor was friendly and kept the workout varied and fun.
I was surprised at the size of the pool - it really is big! 
The water temperature in the pool is slightly warmer than it is at Brittania which I really liked as I can get cold after aquafit and there were a lot less children.
I am looking forward to seeing the windows open in the summer so I can swim with a nice view of the water and the Westside. 
I would absolutely recommend this pool to anyone.",2012-02-29T18:59:01Z,30
10,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,Thank Canadian Dolphins Swim Club for hosting a practice for my son while vacationing.,2019-11-29T00:12:15Z,30
11,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"The gym.

Ugh. I hate going to the gym! 
Maybe if the VAC was a little more up to date, my opinion would change.
Hauling my ass to the gym is difficult on any day. I have so many other things I could be doing, like washing the walls, or vacuuming...

The 90's era equipment is in desperate need of an overhaul. And, I know it smells in gyms... but couldn't they figure out some better ventilation in there? 

OK, enough whining. I'm gonna need a spotter.",2011-02-14T22:56:56Z,30
12,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"I am writing this review today for two reasons.   1) to inform you the reader and 2) hopefully inspire myself to get my ass in gear and go to the pool.  

so for years you could find me swimming back and forth at the aquatic centre usually about 4 times a week.  They have the best facilities  in the downtown core.  Complete with olympic size pool, diving tower, and dive tank.  I like going here b/c at any time of the day they rope off three lanes or more to dedicate to people who like to swim laps.  No fear if you cant swim that well they have a slow lane, medium lane, and a fast lane.  They also have an excellent array of aqua size classes, swimming lessons, and kid things.  heres a tip for ya... they have a separate pool for children located in another building so if you want to get away from the children this is the best place to go.  One thing you should be aware of is every year during the summer they close the pool down for cleaning an repairs but not to worry this time of the year is the best time to go the extra mile and head to the pool at second beach.  happy swimming!",2008-09-24T00:19:41Z,30
13,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"The Aquatic Centre is one of the city's only Olympic-length swimming pools (50 M). You'll want to check the schedule to make sure that the swim team isn't practicing. They change the lanes so that you're swimming the width (25 M) instead of the full 50-metre length. It opens up more lanes, but you have to swim twice as many!

There's a diving team there, so you can watch them spin and twist off the spring board, 5 M, 7.5 M or 10 M boards. When they're not practicing, the public can try their luck and test their courage on the boards.

There's a baby pool and swimming lessons are offered on-site. For older patrons the small, but adequate gym might be more useful. There's a three bikes, elliptical machines, rowing machines, free weights ... there's two or three of everything, but it's never too crowded.

There's a 13-person hot tub and a dry sauna room to relax after your workout. Those are usually pretty crowded in the late-afternoon/early evening. 

It costs $42 for a month pass from 2009, 10-ticket passes and one-visit passes ($4.75ish) are also available. They're all being adjusted for 2009, so check the website. Monthly passes give you access to all Vancouver Park's Board facilities.",2008-12-09T01:59:33Z,30
14,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"With the weather growing cool, people are becoming more and more inclined to just sit at home. I'm guilty of it too! Compared to other areas of Canada, Vancouverites are spoiled in the weather department. Still, who wants to go for a bike ride when the cold air promises to cut into your every pore?

The Vancouver Aquatic Centre is a good place to go if you're keen to stay active through the winter months but still want to shield yourself from the cold. They have a large indoor pool and work out area for those looking for a combination of cardio and anaerobic workouts. The facilities are nice, well maintained and thankfully come without the exorbitant monthly gym membership fee. The public swimming and lane hours vary from season to season so be sure to check the website or call ahead for an updated schedule.",2008-11-19T11:07:08Z,30
15,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"It was a disgusting place for a swim. Your locker will be broken into easily even though you use the locker and key they provided, and PAID for it. Our locker got broken into, and lost $3000 value stuff, and guess what? NONE surveillance cameras in the entire building, even the entrance, and the staff can't do anything, we asked for the manager or supervisor to speak with, and the male staff told us that they are equal, not calling manager to present. That's ridiculous, have been working in the retail for years in Canada, there is always somebody on duty who is in charge of the store at all times!  Wry sad to hear that excuse is from a Canadian, and trying to push the responsibility back to the customers. Long story short, Zero cameras in the building, you will be charged when using their lockers, but they are not responsible for your loss. DO NOT GO HERE, many places in Vancouver are more insure and have nicer pools and staff. This very first experience just made me sick. What a place running by ""well trained"" Van CITY!",2017-10-22T17:33:02Z,30
16,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"Great place for a 50m lengths swimming. All sorts of people can be found here, which is one of the things I love about this place. You'll find all races, classes, religions, etc. and I've met some very interesting characters here. The place is clean, big, and the water temp is just right. After a swim, the communal co-ed sauna and whirlpool are great for relaxing and a little chat.",2011-07-09T17:16:33Z,30
17,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"1- and 3-meter divings boards and 5,7,&10 M platforms. Awesome diving well separate from the pool. It's hard to find this in the US in s public pool.",2018-06-06T05:07:33Z,30
18,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"It is not the best swimming pool, but it worth the money. I like the big size of it. I do not like gyms and never go there; so I cannot comment on that. The water has so much chlorine, but I guess it is better than getting disease! And, actually, I like water temperature. I prefer a little cooler water for swimming, it is easier for breathing (imho!)... and it is not crowded.",2016-02-29T03:11:44Z,30
19,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,This place is run down and dirty. The floor in the women's change room looked like it had never been cleaned in weeks. Balls of hair everywhere. Even blood on the floor beside a used tampon applicator(not even by the washroom side; the change room floor)! I'd give it no stars if I could but I know this probably won't be posted if I put less than 2 stars.,2015-01-17T18:53:22Z,30
20,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"Vancouver Aquatic Centre to the city: ""Please upgrade me. I am cavernous and mouldy. Here's an idea, why not make condo developers contribute to a fund to help upgrade aging public facilities? We don't need more dog parks, we need better public infrastructure. You listening, Mayor Gregor?""",2011-02-16T03:03:02Z,30
21,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"Started going here for Basic Swimming classes as I failed to master it when I was younger.

Bruce was our Instructor and he is amazing! I was afraid to simply put my head underwater and by the end of the class and with much patience and practice I was able to glide under water using a few strokes. He takes the time to work with you even in a class and is seriously patient. He's a bit injured and takes on more of a Manager role at the Center but still took the time to really work with the 5 people in my class.
I will now be signing up for the next level, thanks Bruce you helped me learn one of the hardest things I've ever had to do! I appreciate your patience.",2014-10-26T20:16:18Z,30
22,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"This place is now falling into disrepair. Run down and dirty. The locks on the lockers don't work. Overpriced. Paid $6 to use the hot tub that used to be pretty good, to have it shut down because it was leaking all over the hallway. This is now a refuge for welfare bums and street people. Has been eclipsed by new YMCA. Go to the Aquatic Center if you want to be disgusted and irritated.",2014-12-29T19:59:45Z,30
23,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"Last night I decided to try out the Aqua Fit class and it was sooooo much fun.  The instructor, Zack, was energetic and motivational and it was 80s music night! I had no idea that water workouts could be so entertaining and physically benficial.  I woke up this morning sore and feeling wonderful.  I will be returning for sure!",2011-01-27T20:08:59Z,30
24,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"I've been coming to the Van Aqua for almost 10 years.  They have a giant pool that is perfect for laps, with slow, medium and fast lanes and a fitness centre.  Olympic sized pool for future Olympiads. The diving boards are phenomenal. So high up in the air!   It's never too busy or noisy, sorry kids you are noisy, and I always feel comfortable.  No creepy men gawking or anything.  The hot tub and pool areas are clean and the hours are great.  I would recommend this neighbourhood centre for everyone.",2009-01-22T06:17:43Z,30
25,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"This really is a pool for swimmers......the best opportunity in Vancouver for length swims. 

Huge change room is always clean (I recommend the big one, not the adults only one). If you can get there during the weekdays for your lengths, you will have lots of room in the lanes. 
Check the schedule before you go! On evenings and weekends, sometimes there are several things going on at the same time, and length opportunities are compromised.",2015-01-11T02:07:17Z,30
26,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,The fitness centre has 1980s equiptment. Very hot and steamy enviroment at the pool & wirlpool. Make sure you go during the hours where there arent many swimming classes for teens. Or youd be very frusterated swimming with a bunch of kids. Weekends are ok with less people....unless they have a diving competition or waterpolo meet.,2013-08-29T06:02:11Z,30
27,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"This building needs some serious overhauling! The *only* reason I go here is because it's the only pool close enough to me when I have to resort to busing. I find the water to be really cold (and every time I'm there I hear someone saying that same thing) and the gym needs a huge upgrade (I don't even bother with the gym there anymore). It would be great to see some money put into this place, or at least increase the pool temp very slightly.",2014-04-26T16:37:55Z,30
28,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"Having a full membership at the Aquatic Centre is the best thing I have ever done.  I go to the gym Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and swim Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.  The gym instructors (sadly Erin has now left) are amazing.  Everick Golding has been my utmost saviour.  Not only has he helped me mentally on many occasions when things aren't going so well he has helped unbelievably with my gym workouts. He constantly stops to chat and tell me if I am not doing something correctly, or shows me new stuff to do.  THAT is what I want and need at a gym. He is simply amazing. The other instructors are also good and very very friendly.  Sead and Elaine are fantastic.  My swimming has really picked up and the lifeguards are friendly and amazing.  Even stopping to help when I was trying to learn to do the tumble turn.  Thanks Nicole - you are a breath of fresh air always.  You can't lose joining up here. You will make many new friends as I have.",2014-12-25T23:33:53Z,30
29,Vancouver Aquatic Centre,3.3,"I am a pretty active guy, and have a flex pass.  I usually use the gym at the Westend Community Centre as the one at the Aquatic Centre gym is small, worn down and extremely hot. But in a pinch it works out before a swim.  I like the pool when the 50m are available which unfortunately is not that often as the lanes are either closed and rented out to private individuals and clubs, therefore the one to three lanes that are open are extremely crowded, that the water boils like feeding pahrannas. Therfore this is not a space that caters to the public despite our taxe dollars pay for it.  Unless you are retired or belong to a swim club, which means adiddional costs, this pool is not a public pool. This January they took part of Sunday afternoons away from familys to cater to private lessons and clubs, kicking serious recreational swimmers to the curb again.  No 50m just  terrible 21m, the swimmers were pretty mad.  I guess they want the westenders, coal, harbour, yale town, downtowners, to drive to hillcrest or get unfit.  Quite sad at the lack of availavility.",2012-02-05T23:37:39Z,30
30,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"This facility is great! We did a family morning at the pool on a weekday when the rest of the city was in school. Aside from lap swimmers, the leisure side of the pool complex was a mix of preschool-aged kids and retirees soaking in the large jacuzzi. There is a shallow and large wading pool for kids to play, a lazy river with a quieter small pool in the center, and then a large hot tub. The jacuzzi and wading pools have a stairs as well as a gently sloped ramp for entry, which is an inclusive way of building a pool as well as fun for the kids. There are a few toys available (balls, pool noodles) and plenty of life jackets for the kids. There are a good number of lifeguards who seemed reasonable. I didn't use them, but there is also a steam room and a sauna.

Large locker rooms have plenty of lockers, changing rooms, shower space, sinks, and toilets. Soap is provided but no other products (shampoo, lotion).",2024-02-23T15:17:48Z,35
31,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"Terrific facility in the heart of Vancouver.

Hillcrest Aquatic Centre is across the street from Queen Elizabeth Park.  The facility has a large main pool that is sometimes partitioned to allow one end to offer laps and the other end to offer swimming lessons.  Without the partition, you would have a full length pool.  

Adjacent to the main pool is a kid's pool with lots of ramps and stairs to allow entry into the water.  The water is shallow enough to allow most kids to keep their heads above water.  There are cannons and sprinklers for kids to interact with.  Additionally, there is a section of the pool that has a gentle current that propels kids along in a large circular loop.  The pool offers pool noodles and some toys for visitors.

There is even a large hot-tub section next to the kid's pool for people to soak their aching joints.  Also, there are diving boards of various heights, a steam room and an outdoor pool.

What I like most about Hillcrest Aquatic Centre is that there are large changing rooms available for families with kids to change in.  These same rooms can also be used by bashful types who don't like people staring at their twigs and berries.  

One complaint I have, however, is that the water coming out of the showers is way too hot!  I have been scalded on several occasions!

Essentially, Hillcrest Aquatic Centre has something for everyone.",2018-11-01T18:40:03Z,35
32,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"This Aquatic Centre is a fantastic facility.  It is very crowded, with many regulars. Sauna is very busy and quite often dealing with others performing stretching exercises or laid out on benches. Hot tub is nuts. Over crowded anytime of the day. Swim lane are narrow, I am new (4 months) into my new exercise routine and each time I get into the SLOW lane to get started, fast swimmers use the lane because it is not as crowded. They come across as entitled and rude as the pass/hit you while your trying get you laps in. No help from life guards so the signage is a waste of time. All lanes should just say open swimming. Will not renew my pass. Off the UBC to see if they are better.",2023-01-21T03:11:00Z,35
33,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"Lazy river pool, leisure pool area with water toys and sprays, hot tub, lanes for length swimming, sauna, steam room, 3 heights of diving boards.... what more can you ask for? Ok, maybe they're missing a water-slide. 

I think this place is great to bring young children and introduce them to swimming or the pool since they have a beach-style entry into the water. The water in the leisure pool is also ridiculously warm. Staff are all so friendly here, and this place is very family-friendly as well. In addition to men's and women's change rooms, they also have a large area for family rooms. This location will be able to accommodate everyone in your family. It is missing a star in my ratings because of a couple of things. First of all, I really do not think the steam room is steamy enough. Compared to other steam rooms that I've been to in another community center (ie. YMCA), the one here is very, very mild. Secondly, this location can get super crowded during peak times, which makes it difficult to actually swim sometimes!",2015-12-15T08:27:27Z,35

35,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"Awful experience. We paid for the tickets and 2 mins late for our section, we got refused to get in, they resell the ticket right away. There aren't any indication on the website says we would lose our ticket if we come in late! Whether in movie theater, concert and any events, there would never ever refused customer to enter.

37,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"Too bad this beautifully designed pool is extremely crowded and unpleasant. Aggressive older ""regulars"". Constant spitting. Changing rooms, pool deck - filthy. They close off the lane swimming, so its about the same length as a regular COV indoor pool. The hot tub is the craziest of all: standing room only, packed like sardines, and you will not leave without contracting the latest, most severe strain of flu.  Avoid it like The Plague (literally!).",2017-09-21T02:09:28Z,35
38,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"Attentive, alert lifeguards, awesome staff, awesome facility. Generally clean, especially considering the volume of people it handles. 

My only complaint is how the family change rooms are constantly taken by older singles or couples with cultural-based modesty issues using what are clearly marked family change rooms while I'm standing with a crying, freezing baby. It's amazing how these people suddenly know no English when called out for their rudeness. I'd love to see the family showers restricted to families with small children only.",2015-04-03T18:39:35Z,35
39,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"Today was the coldest wettest July 2nd in Vancouver that I can remember. Biking outdoors seemed unappealing. 

After a little bit of thought a Cold Gray Day in July plan appeared. So we got into the car and drove (blasphemy) to Hillcrest Pool and we realized we where not alone the parking lot was full but this is because Hillcrest is a Great Pool Adults and Kids like. 

What Makes this Pool Great

Everyone I interacted with were great. Check-In person smiled as they took our frees. The  Lifeguards actively managed the pools manged. The pools and cleaning staff also do a great job.  

The Diving Pool is a world class and fun to swim in and even more fun to jump into. The Lap Pool was fine and third pool is what I call and Adult Aqua Aerobics Pool/ Play area for using kick boards and flotation sticks made for a fun visit.

My visit to the pool made today's cold wet weather feel irrelevant for a while and I hope to go back soon.",2012-07-03T05:24:25Z,35
40,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"That one star is for the good facility.

I am rating their pool party package that is $195. DO NOT...EVER! make the same mistake we did by booking the Percy Norman Room.

1. We chose that room because it is adjacent to the pool. Much easier for our guests to be in and out but no. We
cannot use the access door.

2. The hours are strictly 1 1/2 hours. They do not allow extension. They should skip hosting a kids party if they will limit their hours. We are talking about kids/toddlers here! They can be very unpredictable no matter how much you plan your time. 1 1/2 hours is not even enough for snacks and chit chats. They should just tear that room down! It's useless! Also 1 1/2 hours includes set-up and pack-up! 

3. They did not let us use their caddy for our stuff! Because they only have one or two caddies and they
are booked on another party! I asked the party leader in another room if I can use it BUT no he said I can't even if the host hasn't arrived yet while me and my husband are already there and will only take us 5 mins to load things up and unload everything. The party leaders did not even helped us find any available caddy or could have at least spoke to the other party leader and negotiate. They just effortlessly said no, they don't have any caddy for us! 

4. DECORS! This is part of what we paid for and I was told I can choose a theme. Guess what?! they just provided us with plain purple and green table cloth a fee balloons.  I still provided the tinkerbell stuff! While a friend of mine who had their son's party at another community center provided their transformer's themed decors! 


WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!",2015-06-15T05:48:31Z,35
41,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"I swim here, 4-5 times a week. It get's crowded. People are generally dicks in the lanes and every-time I swim and catch sight of a band-aid sitting on the pool floor.

But the water is heated. The showers have good pressure. There are lots of staff on hand. 

For families this is the spot, indoor lazy river, outdoor kiddy funtime splash pool. 

WARNING: This s not a place to go if you are afraid of naked old people. I've seen so many old, naked, Asian men's penises. 

WARNING: This is not the place to go if you're afraid to see naked children. Children have no shame. They pee on each other in the showers!! I've seen it!!",2012-08-15T22:07:11Z,35
42,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"I was happy to hear about this pool opening especially when the Downtown Aquatic centre is closed for maintenance...I also got a tan from swimming at the Kits pool 4 times!

This place is way too kid-friendly. Maybe I'm a bit jealous but the outdoor pool is pretty dedicated to them with all the jets, sprays and shallow water. A big portion of the indoor space is also dedicated to them although I see a lot of seniors enjoying the lazy river too. I just wish that they have more 50 m lanes in the fall. 

About the lanes...people should try to respect the lanes and go with the flow. The other day, a girl and her mother were swimming in my lane, the medium lane. I was getting annoyed because not only were they moving slowly but they didn't allow others to pass. Usually, if I find that people are passing or attempting to pass, I'd (1) move to the slower lane or (2) let them go ahead of me when I reach the end. I knew the girl was uncomfortable but the mother was telling her to ignore the other swimmers and just keep going (with her trailing behind as a buffer). It's okay to go to a slow lane. I've done it many times as I fatigued in my laps. Let's be considerate! And no spitting!

Anyways, one time while the bulkheads were stuck, I decided to try the Aquafit (aerobics) and loved it. I've tried the morning, evenings and the deep aquafit. Morning ones have a lot of seniors but you can challenge yourself by jumping higher or pumping your arms more. I remembered that I got into it so much once that I almost collided into an old lady when we were ""running"" in a large circle. 

The evening one also gets crowded. I've been to one and it was slighter harder but you could do whatever you want underwater...or above. Go at your own pace. I like to kill myself at these things. I'm the one with the red face. 

The other night, I tried the deep water one which takes place, duh, in the diving pool. I love the waist floatation belts. Those are so cool. I find the evening regular shallow aquafit gets me more worked up with the jumping and pumping. I mean, with all the arm pumping and ""running"", you can only go so fast in deep water. 

You don't need to know how to swim to do the regular aquafit because the floor is moved up so that the water only hits you at chest or waist level. It's great for me because I'm totally not coordinated. But waist up, no one can tell.

70- person hot tub: Because it's so large, it's not as easy to maintain the hot temperate. Sometimes, not all the jets are turned on. 

There are ladies, families and men changing areas. One time, a lady was telling this mother who was getting her son to shower in the ladies area about the family area. She got really defensive. 

First, there are only 6 showers in the ladies area and the change room is open. I'm not a prude but I'm already trying to be non-chalant about showing my skin amongst others who have the same anatomy that it's just one more thing to have boys around. I'm sure they feel awkward too. So please, please, take advantage of the family change areas with private change stalls.

Showers: 4 stalls with curtains and towel hooks on the outside (never noticed them until my last visit). Yay! That saves me the naked walk (with my bathing suit draped over my front) to the far wall of hooks. 

Only do-able improvement: Perhaps they could add a small shelf in each shower stall so we could put our shampoos, etc. The soap dish doesn't do much. Maybe more hooks on the other empty wall.

Just like other public lockers, you get your 25 cents back.

Another consideration: Shower before entering pool. First, it's cleaner and second, if you saturate your bathing suit with water, the chlorine won't be able to penetrate and ruin your suit as quickly (so I've read).",2010-08-27T22:58:02Z,35

44,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"Having watched this building grow and having visited it in its incarnation as an Olympic venue, our whole family was very excited to see it finally open. Our first opportunity to visit was after it had been open about a week and we were certainly not disappointed.

The main pool is a great facility with movable bulkheads separating out the lap area from the diving, with 1, 3 and 5m boards, and shallow ends. It has a huge indoor play pool for kids with a big lazy river and lots of fun sprays and splash toys to play with. The hot tub is pretty large too with plenty of space to sit and relax. The changing rooms are good too with plenty of cubicles in the family changing area - despite it being busy we didn't have to wait around for somewhere to change.

The one thing I'm not convinced about, though, is the outdoor pool area. It's shallow - although it does get up to 1m deep in places. It also has a few splash/spray installations. When we went, it was raining outside and whilst we had fun, it seems like it's a bit misconceived overall. As a splash park, there are better free splash parks to cool down in around the city. As a wading pool, then it's really a bit too deep in places for smaller children. But it's not deep enough realistically to replace an outdoor swimming pool - plus it has a very rough non-slip surface that, whilst super-safe for wading, gets very hard on the knees and elbows if you're an adult. It may well grow on me, but first impressions are that it's not really one thing or another. It's certainly no replacement for the wonderful old Mount Pleasant outdoor pool.

All in all, it's a great improvement on Percy Norman pool and I look forward to the rest of the centre coming opening up.",2010-08-10T01:18:24Z,35
45,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"Best gym pool in Vancouver. after living in the U.S. for so long I forgot how spoiled my fellow canadian comrades are with public pools and gym. I can pay 150 a month in California and the amenities don't even come close.

Remember it is a public pool so bring your flip, flops.

46,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"This is a top-notch facility; having spent some time at the other community centre (Creekside) constructed with the Olympics as it's impetus, it was a really pleasant surprise.

The fitness centre is well equipped with a  practical layout, lots of benches and free weights, all the necessary machines, and a great view. there's plenty of cardio equipment and everything is spaced out nicely. 

The pool is excellent with a very large hot tub, a children's area, diving, lanes, and a third area partitioned off for classes. I'm told that there is an outdoor pool as well but i did not see it my first visit. Furthermore, they offer swimming lessons for adults as well as children, which as an adult who unfortunately needs them, had until now been impossible to find.

The staff seemed friendly and knowledgeable, and the patrons a reflection of the neighbourhood, which is as it should be. 

I will be going out of my way to attend swim lessons there, and to use the fitness centre also. I suspect many will do the same and before long the place will get over-crowded (a la Mount Pleasant) ... I'll keep you posted if it does, but in the 2.5 hours i was there today it was fine.",2011-03-23T04:36:05Z,35
47,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"Sure it got crowded, but everyone seemed to be having fun including my family (my sister and I are old: I'm in my 20s and she's 16 along with our parents). Went in July 2014, beautiful sunny day. 

The facilities are big and modern. I enjoyed how Hillcrest offers an outdoor heated pool with sun bathing opportunities (with chairs!). The indoor pools were a lot of fun: a ""river"" that pushes everyone along, hot tub that looks like it can accommodate 30 people, kiddie pools and lap pools with a diving board. 

Hillcrest also has a steam room and a sauna. Didn't use it but it was great to have that option.

There were lockers that you can use for a quarter and shower rooms for individuals and families (with body wash). The change rooms didn't feel crowded and it was also decent in terms of cleanliness. 

Parking was crowded, but to be expected on a sunny day. We just need to be a bit patient knowing that lots of people are enjoying this centre.

Having it been our first time visiting, I thought that Hillcrest is a well-maintained facility with lots of visible staff including lifeguards. Had a great time and would definitely return.",2014-07-28T08:45:19Z,35
48,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"For the unique circumstances of our family -- three kids four years and under, the older two being autistic -- this place is a disaster.

Access and parking is difficult and confusing, and not particularly near the pool itself.

The changing area is a disaster.  There are no family change rooms.  What they do have is  the large locker area between the men's and women's change rooms where there is a... I don't know what to call it.  There are two banks of private change cubicles along the wall, and many if not all of those cubicles have showers inside them.  Then there are two banks of cubicles running across the area, which don't have showers.  This area is not designated as a family change area, so most of the people using it end up being singles who, for whatever reason, have a hang-up about getting undressed in their respective change room.

Common sense would suggest that when you're putting your suit on to go swimming, you don't need one of the larger cubicles with a shower.  You could use one of the plentiful smaller ones without a shower, and leave ones with a shower for those getting out of the pool.  But no, it doesn't work that way at Hillcrest.

As it was, our older son had a melt down when we got changed both going in and coming out.  The cubicles have seven foot walls, but the ceilings are like 20 feet high, so it gets really noisy and echo-y, and he was quickly overwhelmed.  I'd suspect that's the rule rather than the exception with autistic kids at this facility.

If you have to use a toilet, I recommend going somewhere else before, or holding it in until later.  It's not a good setup there at all, they aren't clean, and the odds of finding TP seem to be about 50-50.

The pool is completely unsuitable for small children.  There's a small area with water jets shooting up and across that's about two inches deep.  Then the rest of the pool the shallowest part is .9 meters.  It just doesn't work for the smaller kids.

You can see from the photos that the swimming area is huge.  It, and the locker area, are completely open.  The view of the outside is great, with the two long walls basically being all windows.  But the flip side is that as a parent, I found it very creepy, and I didn't feel as safe as I'd when taking my kids swimming.",2015-11-30T21:10:23Z,35
49,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"Always busy, but such a great space!! The kids pool is incredible and is probably only second to the Wave Pool at Richmond Riverport (in my humble opinion). Besides the crowds, my only complaint is the depth of the hot tub; I'm short (5'2"") and I have to crouch to get my shoulders under the water when sitting. 

There is free parking and it's a great location near Queen Elizabeth Park, Little Mountain baseball diamonds, and between Main St. and Cambie St. The #16 bus stops mere yards away from the entrance.",2012-03-28T00:01:03Z,35
50,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"Of all the pools, in all the towns, in all the world (or at least the ones I've been to!)... I'd probably walk into this one first.

I go there regularly for fitness three times a week, participating in their deep water aquafit classes. 

The space designated for DWF is excellent - large and deep. It certainly surpasses the area in the community pool this one replaced, the Percy Norman Pool (although I do have a warm spot for that pool, where I went for eight years.) The quality of the classes vary, depending on the instructor (not all instructors are created equal, after all) but I believe you can get value from any class - it's up to the participant to make the most of the class, but some instructors are better than others. The line-up changes fairly regularly, so you don't normally get stuck with the same instructors for long time periods. 

My one comment about some instructors is, they rely too much on ""swimming-type"" routines. One of the reasons I quit swimming lengths was because of continuing shoulder problems; many people who chose aquafit do so because they cannot swim lengths. When I first started doing aquafit in 2002, this was not an issue; it's just in the past couple of years that ""swimming"" has crept into the routines.

A real plus: since moving over from PNP, they've added three additional DWF classes on M-W-F. They maintained the M-W 8-9 p.m. classes, but also added 12:45-1 p.m. classes on M-W-F, which really adds to the flexibility of scheduling fitness activities. I guess there were some Sunday morning classes, but I never even attempted to get up that early for them, so I can't speak to them.

Moving on from the programs, the facility is top-notch. There is an excellent steam room and a dry sauna, as well.

The hot tub is very spacious; however, the vast majority of the jets do not shoot out with enough pressure, in my opinion. The best jacuzzi jets I've been to at a public pool are at Bonsor, in Burnaby.

There is also a leisure pool and fully regulation sized pool for swimming lengths. The changing facilities - lockers, showers, bathroom facilities - are also all top-notch.

The staff is very friendly and helpful.

Overall, it's a great facility, whether you're looking for fitness or just some family fun.",2012-04-14T22:06:38Z,35

53,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"A great facility for families with kids.... or people who dont actually swim. If you are looking for a place to do a lap workout, go to the Aquatic Centre (or Kits Pool in the summer!).

This place gets CRAZY BUSY!!! Parking can be impossible.....ride your bike. 

The swim lanes are NARROW, slightly under the standard lane width. There is often a mishmash of swimming abilities distributed amongst the various designated lanes for different speeds. With the narrow lanes, its difficult to pass someone....especially those with crazy wide frog kicks! The only time the 50 meter lanes are available is EARLY morning on some mornings only. Shame!
This centre is a good example of the trend of the generic changing rooms, with change booths separate from the lockers, for families and those who fear nudity. This system, and the private shower rooms therein, takes up WAY too much space. The result is that the designated men's changeroom is small and always crowded, many of the lockers are broken. And the floor is disgusting. 

We were very disappointed when this place opened up near our home. It really isnt designed for athletes....its designed for kids, and for people that like to sit in a FULL 70 person hot tub with a bunch of strangers...",2014-10-02T16:49:03Z,35
54,Aquatic Centre At Hillcrest Park,3.3,"Beautiful facility for sure, but the lane swimming can be horrible. Too busy and too chaotic.
There is always lap swimming available, but usually only 25m lanes are open rather than 50m lanes. The moveable bulkheads seem handy and smart but they essentially eliminate the 50m lengths which is too bad.
There is no policing of the lanes by the lifeguards, so you get an awful lot of people who don't really know how to swim, doing weird back strokes and clogging up the medium lane. The other problem is they rent way too many lanes out to clubs, so even at peak times you will often find only three narrow  (no passing) 25 m lanes for public lengths. This in a wildly popular pool with the capacity for 8 50m lanes.  What a zoo. 
The outdoor pool is a nice place to cool off after your lap swim in the summer.
The hot tubs is very large, holds like 50 people, but is very shallow and not hot enough.
Steam room and sauna are okay.
Parking is a nightmare after work and people are so very rude. 
Never use the ice rink or gym so cannot comment.

There were clumps of hair and grey stuff all over the change room floor.  I don't think this facility was meant for such high traffic.   The staff just couldn't keep up.

70,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"As mentioned in my previous review of the YMCA, it's a great gym, but the people there are just HORRIBLE, hence the two stars.  (If I didn't encounter such awful people, I'd give the gym at least four stars.)  There's the relatively minor annoyance of people talking VERY LOUDLY on their phone or to their friend while on the exercise floor or machines; there are guys who throw basketballs at people in the gym (last week, my friend got hit in the head, very hard); there are people like in my last review who are complete assholes and have no business being out in public; and last night, some loser who was drinking a bright blue drink from a plastic cup (it looked like melted slurpee or Naked Grape Blue) and spilled it all over the ground in the atrium, right in front of the turnstiles to get into the gym.  I saw him look at the floor, see the sticky mess he had made, shrug his shoulders, and just walked off.  Ugh.  (I reported the spill to staff so that they could clean it up, and prevent someone from slipping.)  And a couple of weeks ago, I was harassed by some creep.

I was on a treadmill, and four minutes into my workout, two obnoxious middle aged men went onto the empty treadmills beside me.  While they weren't being creepy, they were talking excessively loud, practically yelling, as if they were in some nightclub.  (While there is a lot of background noise at the YMCA from people using the machines and talking, it's a relatively quiet gym - which is something I like - as they don't blast music on the exercise floor, which is what other gyms seem to do.)  Not wanting to put up with their yelling for the duration of my workout, I stopped the machine at the five minute mark and started gathering my stuff to leave.  As I was gathering my things and getting off the machine, the guy right beside me started talking at me (and I also had earphones on), and asked me my name.

FUCK OFF, ASSHOLE.  DO NOT TALK TO ME FOR NO REASON.  AND WHY THE HELL SHOULD I GIVE YOU MY NAME, WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO OFFER ME YOURS?  (Not that I wanted to know his name.  But demanding someone give them their name without introducing yourself is fucking RUDE.)

Now, for the guys who are clueless and don't understand why this was upsetting, it's not that I have a problem with people talking to me or asking me a question, regardless of gender or age.  It's because in this situation, this guy had NO REASON to talk to me; he didn't say, ""Excuse me..."" to indicate a question, nor did he say something, such as an observation he wanted to share with me.  He right out demanded to know what MY name, a personal piece of information, was, as if I owed him an answer.  And he did so when he noticed that I was walking away.  Awww, I guess creepy guy was disappointed that he wouldn't be working out beside a hot chick.  (Which is entirely his own fault - if he hadn't been so fucking loud and obnoxious, I wouldn't have been leaving.  But since he turned out to be a creep, it was a good thing I was leaving when I was, because I would have been extra pissed off if in the middle of my workout I had to leave due to harassment.)

Guys - just because you see a woman that YOU'RE attracted to doesn't mean that you are entitled to speak to her.  She is under no obligation to satisfy YOUR wants, and if you can clearly see that she doesn't want to talk to you, STFU.  While it's OK to strike up a conversation with someone, it is fucking creepy and obnoxious to start talking at a woman, who is minding her own business, simply because she is a woman, and if you don't really have anything to say.  Women know the difference between friendly chitchat and creeps hitting on them.

I reported this creep to the YMCA staff, but of course the useless staff did nothing.  I wish I could go to the gym, or go to the store, or go about minding my own fucking business, without some creep harassing me.

But nevertheless it's run pretty well and I think they just need to higher some personal trainers that actually lift weights and know how to help their clients. I see to many of them preaching incorrect form to female clients on squatting. Maybe if they hired some actual trainers that look the part, this wouldn't be a problem.

80,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"Overall this place is fantastic. Great facilities so on and so forth. The only problem I have with it is that they only allow you to reserve a squash court once a week.

85,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"With the full gym, pool, lockers, and cafe, it's no wonder why the Village People sang praises about this place!

My sister and I went on a short trip and wanted to make sure we stayed in shape while away from home. We came in fully expecting to pay a few bucks for day passes but we were pleasantly surprised with a free pair of 12 day passes!

The gym itself had three full squat racks. THREE! My sister and I had no problem finding a free rack. 

And of course it had all the other things typical to a gym-- free weights machines etc etc. But what did it for me was the full kettlebell set! I love kettlebells and was ecstatic to be able to do my kettlebell exercises at the YMCA as well. 

After our workout, we had yummy protein shakes as recovery drinks. Perfect end to a great gym session.

The girl who signed us up wasn't exactly friendly and we were not even offered a tour. We also had to ask for all the paperwork regarding the schedules etc

The U.S. Y's are not affiliated with Canada.This Robert Lee location is absolutely awful. They are so overcrowded that I can't get to a station without asking someone to stop texting and let me join in. The Robert Lee YMCA has ignored my suggestions to post a sign saying, ""as a courtesy to others, please refrain from using your cell phone while on this equipment."" This sign is standard on every other YMCA I have ever been to. As a result, I will be cancelling my membership tomorrow.",2019-09-20T08:21:56Z,99
91,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"Awesome! I love the YMCA. It's really affordable for how much you get -- loads of classes, big gyms, swimming pools. I really like the classes but it can be difficult to get in them at some times. They might want to try out other options, like maybe sign up online for the class? The staff is really great and there's some really good instructors. I also like how fresh towels are everywhere, and the equipment is modern and usually all works. 

The cafe is nice to have but some really simple things they should also carry -- reusuable water bottles, hair elastics, etc. 

The only big problem with this location are the CHANGE ROOMS! They are terrible. They are so cramped and at busy times you have to like rush in there and elbow naked women out of the way to get a locker. And its also used for the swimming pool? So there's like wet people and swimsuits were you want to change from like work clothes to yoga clothes. They are wayyy too small for how many people this place services. I've found some work arounds, such as wearing exercise clothes there and using the lockers in the hall but it's still annoying. 

And there is some unused space in the building, like the random CIBC ""reflexion space"" or whatever. They should look at building more change rooms, please! Otherwise, I love it here.",2017-10-21T23:24:26Z,99
92,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"The membership desk/reception staff should receive some CUSTOMER SERVIVE training especially when  I pay a $$ monthly membership compared to CoV community centres.   The DT YMCA front desk staff who answered the phones are rude and not helpful.  The Southslope YMCA staff are much better but unfortunately I need to switch to go to the DT one.  When I called to inquire about the facility explaining that I have not been there before, the front desk staff gave me the attitude that ""I should know it and why bother me"" type of client service.  I left messages many times for a few days and I don't get a call back so this time I just keep pressing zero so I can get a live agent.   I tried requesting to speak with a membership desk manager and the agent actually hung up the phone!!  Really!!!

It is such a shame that the customer service is so poor for a potentially a very nice facility.

94,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"With tempuratures close to freezing, there was no way that this Southern California boy was going to be swimming outdoors.  The Robert Lee YMCA was the perfect place to for me to swim while on vacation.  The pool is a 25 yard pool located inside the YMCA.  The pool is UV filtered.  The water temperature was perfect for swimming laps fast.  

The pool was a good pool to swim at.  It has an infinity edge where the edge is at the same level as the water.  The waves you make will not splash back at you.  Additionally, it is nicely tiled which makes the pool pretty quick for swimming laps.  Nice pool for a nice workout.  Lifeguards are on duty watching out to make sure you are safe.

When I show them on my smarthphone the google search with the YMCA Robert Lee address and the Program I am asking them about they on both occasions said sorry but we have none of those programs and walked away to deal with someone else!

I explained that although I think it is a great facility, the fact that it is so busy and double the price of most of it's competitors means that I would be unlikely to sign up for full membership.

Certainly there are cheaper gym memberships to be had in the city, especially if you are willing to put up with poor service for several years in order to see your rates cut by 50%. But life is short, and if you'd prefer to spend a bit more money for quality, friendliness and a true sense of community, ask for a tour.

99,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"I love everything about this gym and I regret no longer being a member. Unfortunately, I decided to go about the Steve Nash route due to location convenience for me at that time. Although location helped my commute, Steve Nash has been one of the worst and unfriendly, selfish, pathetic, and all around poor organizations I've ever dealt with. 

If anyone's thinking of crossing over and leaving the Y for SN, bad call! The only reasons I'm leaving a 4 star is because YMCA only has 4 locations. Robert Lee being the best, the Langara one is okay. However Langara is pretty outdated with their locker room and is always packed full of people, much smaller gym with less equipment, and has poor ventilation/very smelly too. 

I'm aware this is the Robert Lee page however, and the other reason I leave 4 stars is because there was a time my mother died. As the executor, I had to leave town to attend to her estate. The YMCA didn't reimburse me and rudely said it's my fault for not holding the membership. That was honestly the last thing on my mind during such a hard time for me, so they charged the $100 for the 2 months I was out of town anyways. Not good.",2018-06-21T06:30:26Z,99

I like this place because it's comfortable and there's lots of different types of people and fitness levels. You don't feel intimidated going. Also, the membership is quite cheap considering you get basically everything, all the classes, pool access, etc. There's no tier system like Steve Nash (unless you want the fancier changing room). There's lots of towels, cold water, and even a bathing suit dryer. And the front desk will spot you a hair tie!

There's Steve Nash, but every time I checked one of those out it was depressing, with the low ceilings, out of date equipment and high pressure sales. The YMCA was built (or rebuilt) to be a gym. It's a beautiful building and has everything.

The downside is that everyone goes there, including the certain percentage without basic gym etiquette. Re-rack the weights when you're done, and conversely, don't leave the weights on the bench press for 5 mins and expect them to be there when you get back.",2015-05-16T06:48:43Z,99
103,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"A+ facility!

- Indoor Basketball court is maintained very well.  No dusty spots.  My bball heads know how annoying dirty bball floors are for indoor courts. Thank God!! 

- BIG Olympic sized (i think?) pool. Plenty of classes for youngins too.

- Inexpensive monthly plans.  I pay 48 bucks a month with no commitment.

- Tons of Cardio equipment - Rarely do I ever see 100% of the cardio machines occupied. During the peak hours 4-6pm, machines are usually 80% occupied.  The cardio machines can also connect to your cell phone to charge it or play music from it.

- Weight room is decently stacked with dumbbell weights up to 100lbs. No meat heads here either. A+++

- Lockers are provided. NO need to bring your own lock. 

- Restrooms are probably the only downside to the facility.  They're not always clean. And most of the time, there's an old dude that'll be walking around or drying his butt crack at the hand dryer thing (COME ON MANNNNNN!!!!!!!! SMH!!)

- Staff is very friendly! A+++

- Juice bar is fairly inexpensive.",2015-01-21T20:06:04Z,99
104,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"When I need a place to do my workouts while in town, I come here. At $15 per drop in, the price is standard for these days. But it is worth the $15.

The change rooms can get crowded but are fine. The lockers have keys that you take with you after you lock your stuff up. Change room is in good condition.

I do not use public pools, so cannot comment on this one. However, it is always busy looking, and from what I hear, is pretty good.

The weights room is great. However, if you come to the facility at peak after-work hours - it is SOOOO crowded! You really have to be creative with finding space and equipment. Luckily, it is a big place with a few levels. 

There are rowing machines on the 3rd floor too, as well as a small weight rack that goes up to only 20lb of free weight (or 25lb, I can't remember), but is sometimes less crowded. 

Even though it gets more crowded than a county zoo, there are usually some free cardio machines available to do your warm up/cool down/cardio portion. Like the zoo, there are all kinds of people here which makes for very interesting people watching if you are doing something dull like walking uphill on a treadmill for 30 mins. Also, the gymnasium is huge and has glass walls so you can look at everyone messing around in there. In fact, the whole layout of this facility is excellently designed in a very open-concept way. You can see so much from almost every vantage point. Who needs the TV when you have live action all around!

So I highly recommend this place as a place to go to get your exercise fix. Since I am not a regular member, I cannot comment on its specific programs or the consistency of how things are. But the many times I've dropped in, I've always had a good time. I keep coming back, so that says something, eh.",2015-08-27T11:46:22Z,99

I am currently using their 5 day free pass and so far I like it. The atmosphere is nice, staff is very helpful and friendly, the only downside I can see so far is how busy it is!! I'm an evening gymgoer, so I normally make it to the gym around 8:30pm, normally that is the cut line of peak hours but for the past few times I have gone it seems to still be super packed at the time. Then again, I am never there around 5/6 so maybe its just like a can of sardines during that time. Anyways, I will still probably join once I finish my free passes!",2017-04-12T21:07:41Z,99

Only complaint is that there are apartment buildings nearby, so I can't slam my weights down when done a set. Their rules are really holding me back from achieving ultimate douchebagery. 

Could use a few more olympic bars as they are normally in short supply. I have seen people almost come to blows over the squat rack.

111,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"The customer service staff here are more interested in gossiping to each other behind counters than greeting guests. Every morning I felt the bad vibe between staff members and it just made it look like they hated their jobs. 

You need to turn up 20-30 minutes before classes start to secure a spot and if you like to be packed in like sardines in a yoga class, this place is for you. Don't even bother coming in after work between 5-7pm. Looks great that they have racquetball and squash courts, again, good luck ever getting to use them. 

The plus change rooms are nice, though at peak times you'll need to wait for showers, hair dryers, mirror space, etc. They don't seem to care about being overcrowded, you see prospective members being taken on tours regularly.  

The cafe downstairs is hugely overpriced and if you want a fresh protein shake that doesn't taste like poo, you'll have to go elsewhere. 

An upside to this place is the month-to-month membership. When you've had enough of the crowds and bad customer service, you can say bye bye and write a review on Yelp.",2011-09-23T19:30:17Z,99
112,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"I was very optimistic about the new shiny YMCA next door to my home, however my enthusiasm waned quickly.

Beyond the crowds which made it difficult to work out during the weekday evenings.  Frankly, that's not my biggest issue.

I have a gym in my building, and frankly I joined the YMCA for their squash ladder setup.  Again, I was super stoked about this which didn't last....
Due to the crowds, you were lucky if you could book a court a week out and even then, the times would be at 9pm and after.  

Furthermore, the squash ladder list of participants was removed and supposedly was replaced by online system.  The Y never emailed several of us to let us know the new details.    Seems like they need to sort out their service issues before they bring even more people into the gym...

I dropped my membership 3 months into this experiment...

Don't get my wrong, the concept of the Y is awesome.  The execution left a lot to be desired.",2011-07-31T18:02:14Z,99

Has everything (pool, too!), except a running track (likely for space reasons.)

Staff are nice and helpful. Was visiting from out of town, and got a tour of the four story building (a bit maze-like in spots) from a fitness center staff person.

Lots of equipment and space---but did get busy at peak times.

They have a ton of group fitness classes---of variable quality. Their instructors are volunteers, and they DO NOT do Les Mills or Mossa programs, FYI.

114,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"The Y is back and it's fabulous. Its been about 4 weeks since the Y has re-opened its doors to their brand new facilities on Burrard st. YMCA

They host a number of top of the line fitness classes, pool (its small but non of us are Phelps are we?), weight room, numerous treed mills, elliptical machines, steam room, hot tub and the list goes on.

Memberships are quite reasonably priced, 43$/mth if you are a Young Adult (19-35), 53$/mth for the adults, and then there is the plus membership $81/mth where you get towels, private steam room and hot tub and a few other bonuses might not be worth the extra $$

If you sign up now there is sign up fee, $50 I think. For me this is a great place to work out and relax, they are not about getting huge, there are no free weights above 100lbs. The Y is all about a healthy life style for everyone if you are 80lbs or 400lbs everyone is welcome, it's all about life style improvement.

I am currently doing 2-adays...swimming in the AM and running/weights in the PM. The TIGF Spin class is a great way to get your ass kicked into shape for the weekend

I didn't have my bank details the day I wanted to sign up (direct debit is necessary). When I came back THE NEXT DAY I was advised the promotion had finished! Person I spoke to at front desk the day prior did not mention this. I asked if as it was only 24 hours later, if they'd extend the promotion but was told no. I then emailed management and got no reply.",2018-12-02T02:11:13Z,99
116,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"A while back I realized how ridiculous it was that I had a membership to both this YMCA and Steve Nash on Howe/Davie. I was doing personal training at Nash and came to the YMCA because it was closer to home and had a pool.

Well, when my personal training was over, I decided it was time to focus on one location over the other, and I'm (mostly) glad that I chose the Y.

As everyone has said, it's a beautiful facility. It's always been very clean and devoid of any undesirable smells that are all too common with public gyms and pools. The front desk staff are all very friendly and attentive. The cafeteria has a lovely, mostly-healthy selection of tasty foods and beverages, although I usually stay away from it when I can because it's hard to justify paying $8 for a tiny sandwich that I could make for $3-4 at home. 

My reason for not giving five stars is as follows: My main purpose for going to the Y is the gym. It's clean and has a great assortment of equipment, though it gets very, very busy at specific times of the day. There really isn't a lot of space for doing free weights and it's all too common for someone to walk (uncomfortably) in front of you as you're doing your workout. Gym etiquette seems to drop sharply during these busy periods as well. People will walk directly in front of me and start lifting, blocking my view of the mirror. I realize this isn't really the facility's fault, but they could always consider moving a few of the ellipticals and treadmills from that area of the gym somewhere else to make more space.

So yes, the facility is great. The people who go to this facility are terrible and I hate most of them. So I tend to go at very specific times of the day where I know the gym is going to be dead or more quiet - usually in the early afternoon after lunch time or an hour before they close.",2013-06-04T01:03:56Z,99
117,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"I used to be a regular at the Robert Lee before I moved. It is a really great facility, the equipment is all new and well taken care of. The space itself is pretty cool with a few different free-weight and machine areas, a studio room, a pool, and the basketball court all on different levels integrated with the Y offices and spaces throughout. They offer regular and plus-member(for extra per-month) changing rooms which is cool.. Even just the regular changing rooms were clean, and nice. They even had hair dryers which was great. The plus-changing rooms are what you would expect, well even more actually. It has a lounge area, any products you could imagine if you prefer not to bring your own - or forgot something. They had flat-irons and curling irons for your hair.. and a bunch of additional perks. One of the biggest being that it has even more space, and less people while you are trying to do your thing and get ready which is awesome when you are there pre-work and most definitely worth it if you are willing to dish out the extra per month. I only ever used my membership for the gym areas but they offered so many great classes, including yoga classes, all included in the monthly fee. 

I would always be there Mon-Fri for open at 5:30am and the front desk staff was easily the most pleasant I have ever encountered in any gym. That is a big bonus when you are coming in every day before work. It was a facility I looked forward to visiting first thing in the morning and definitely miss it!",2016-01-16T21:55:10Z,99

Easy to sign in, no BS yearly contract that other gym propose. Affordable monthly membership. Easy to stop when you don't need it.
Special plan for low income people or student.
Now the gym itself is great, clean with plenty of machine to do your work-out. Plenty and good quality free classes ( the only one that I don't think is good was the spinning, as it hard to hear the instructor).
A nice cafeteria where you can get your smoothies and snack after a hard work-out.
Clean bathroom and changing room with the only downside that there is not enough locker.

Yes, the only downside is that everybody loves it, meaning too many people.
If you go around 5 PM, be ready to wait for whatever you want to do.
Now I heard that lately they got better .....

If you are tempted go there and ask for a free tour and 1 week trial.

I highly recommend this YMCA and would go there again, if I was living closer !!",2012-10-18T21:05:31Z,99
122,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"Overall, this gym is a great place to work out - while other people talk about the facility being fantastic, what really thrills me is the selection of fantastic group fitness classes with really talented instructors. The cardio dance class is fun, the Zumba class is a huge party, the bootcamps are enjoyable and the yoga classes are incredible. Really, the yoga is the biggest draw for me. Best of all, the group fitness classes - including yoga and pilates - are included in the monthly membership, which is a great value.
 
Best of all, the YMCA is the most community-oriented fitness facility I have heard or been a member of; unlike some of the more shady contract-oriented fitness companies, the YMCA is not gimmicky and I feel happy knowing that my membership fees help to support programs for newcomers, families and seniors. It makes yoga and kinesis classes (check them out! super cool!) just that much more meaningful!",2013-06-25T06:06:54Z,99
123,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"The downtown YMCA is a great location for those living or working nearby.  I do like the facility, it's clean, up to date, and friendly.  I usually swim a couple laps in the pool as well besides using the exercise equipment. And the steam room comes in handy when fighting a cold.  I just wish it wasn't so darn BUSY all the time!  And I also wish it didn't close at 10:30 pm on weekdays and 9 PM on weekends.  I'd prefer it to be open 24 hours, but besides that, it's a great facility.",2014-12-03T16:17:30Z,99
124,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"Visiting in Vancouver and wanted a good work-out and steam room time. I got quick replies to questions about dropping in via email. The Pilates class was full (tokens all gone) so I jumped in a bootcamp class. Brian gave a good 30 min workout with jump rope, high step aerobics jumping, and burpees. I also took in a one hour yoga class which was great. In both classes, I got one on one instructor time to make sure I was doing the drill or position correctly. I then enjoyed the steam room which was very hot just the way I like it.
I'd rate it 5 stars but not able to get the Yelp star rating system to work on my iPad 2!",2012-02-29T09:13:52Z,99
125,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"Well designed. Speaks community. A successfully operating community centre with good process. 

A community centre downtown on Burrard with a state-of-the-art two level fitness facility, fitness classes throughout the day, a swimming pool, a daycare, a community lounge/foyer and community programs (ie. youth entrepreneurship and business planning programs). Inviting to all members of the community, it offers an interactive open environment with welcoming management and fitness trainers, feedback boards from members and free wifi on the main level. 

Ergonomically designed to perfection.  
When you experience it, you'll notice the planning and development of the building, its operations and programming have been strategically developed. You can tell they've thoroughly thought out aspects of design from their community lounge area designed for meetups and dialogue to the multiple functionality of their membership cards. Even the GM's office is on the main level beside the side entrance. He keeps his door open and encourages anyone to stop by and say hi! Solid community thinking has been integrated into the operations. It's brilliant. Look for them ;)

The Fitness Facility. 
The fitness facility is huge and well-layout with a Kinesis system, tons of machines, weights, mat areas, gyms and most notably, good looking (like really attractive) healthy people! ;) It's one of those unwritten things, that everyone who goes, knows. And because of that (and perhaps other reasons), it is always PACKED! So be prepared to wait for a machine or improvise with another way of exercising that muscle you're working on! Least busy time: 8am-noon, weekdays.

Business Programming. 
I'm near completion for the YMB Program for young entrepreneurs and my experience has been amazing. With guest speakers, mentors and highly skilled entrepreneurial-minded programmers (Andrea, Miriam, Andre and Natasha!), the business planning program they've created has been excellent. Not only that, but the the programmers are fabulous to work with, great communicators, and offer thoughtful, critical and encouraging feedback. It's only in its beta phase with a few kinks to work out, but I can honestly say that I'm very impressed. We also get complimentary access to the computer lab and facilities, as their belief is 'healthy bodies + healthy minds.'",2011-11-01T00:12:45Z,99
126,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"New facilities, clean building and if you go at the right time, not overly busy.  Great central location with friendly staff, this place has just about everything.  Lots of machines, squash, gymnasium, pool steam room hot tub, yoga, etc.  

If you hit this place at the right time you won't have to deal with the massive crowds that can be seen at times... I try to go in during business hours as to avoid line ups.  I don't really like having to wait for machines.  

Lots of classes here, and everything is included with your membership.  There are even two types of membership, if you want to spend a bit more money you get towel service and a more secure locker room (even though the public one is fairly secure).",2013-02-09T20:19:44Z,99
127,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"Very convenient downtown location with new equipment, facilities etc.  The aerobic equipment is a delight to use with iPod sync and built in TV monitors.  It makes the time go by so much faster!

Locker facilities are clean and well kept.  Sometimes can be a bit crowded though.  

The classes are FREE (with membership) and also excellent.  You just have to arrive a bit early to make sure you get a spot.  

The pool facilities are also very nice and it's never that crowded.

However, on that note, the fitness area can get very crowded, especially during the peak after-work time.  In my opinion, this is the only major negative point and the reason why I gave it 4 stars.

Otherwise, the facilities, equipment, instructors, pricing etc. are all top notch and highly recommended.  

I have yet to use the gymnasium itself but hope to play drop in badminton or volleyball one of these days.

I've tried the snacks in the lounge area a couple times.  They are well priced, healthy and tasty.  It's a nice place to hang out before or after a workout.

Overall I would highly recommend the YMCA!!!",2011-01-29T00:24:00Z,99
128,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"This facility is fabulous!! It's new, state of the art and so much fun!

As soon as you walk in you notice how new and modern the place is. The main floor over looks the Pool facilities so you can watch people swim if you choose.  There are two change rooms, one is for ""Plus members"" where you get extra perks and towel service. It is not very expensive ta all at only $43 a month for a young adult membership..

The top floor is the gym which is loaded with the greatest equipment.  All cardio machines re also equipped with media. There is a Gym available for different activities. Make sure you know what is scheduled on what day if you are interested in a certain activity!There are also several other rooms used to host various classes

 The only bad thing about this location is that they have terrible customer service and staff can be rude. Besides that this is a great place to enjoy a workout or play your favourite sport! It really helps to get you motivated.

UPDATE: Just a note to update my review. This location has now become extremely crowded. I am not sure if they will do anything to address the issue but it will continue to get worse as the new PATINA Condo building will open in April.",2011-01-17T18:39:27Z,99
129,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"For now I think it's a best fitness in Vancouver, especially you have  a several free time cuz u don't have to meet tons of people around 4-6 and u can find an interesting class here

My favorite classes are

- Monday plyometrics --jump run and engage ur core, and noon cycling 

Tuesday nothing!

- Wednesday 4:15 cycling OMG the hardest cycling class

Thursday Nothing!

- Friday Epoc workout and 5:30 pm spin

- Saturday 9:30 boot camp 

- Sunday I guess boot camp might be good but there is an new instructor",2013-06-29T03:17:37Z,99
130,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"I go to the gym primarily for Group Classes. Since all of the instructors at this gym are volunteers, the management does not endorse any kind of quality control regarding the classes. Most instructors are abysmally bad. Why would a good instructor teach for free though? Which is why majority of them are newbies or just weird. 
There's only a couple of good ones. Is it worth paying for the gym for a couple of classes per week? Methinks not.
Plus, now, they removed the names of the instructors from the schedules so you never know who you are going to get.  
I do not endorse unprofessionalism, mediocrity, and poor quality.  Ta ta, YMCA!",2012-11-23T03:12:12Z,99

132,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"This is my new home away from home. The downtown YMCA has super friendly and helpful staff, and the facility itself is AMAZING! 
Gymnasiums, a pool, hot tub, steam room, VERY well stocked gym (that has all the latest and greatest exercise machines AND you'll be provided with a small towel to wipe down the equipment after you use it) and tons of classes to choose from... and I'm not even scratching the surface here! 
Lot's to see and do. The facility is super clean and very welcoming. Great for people of ALL ages, shapes and sizes. 
Another added bonus? You get a swipe card that you allows you access to a gym locker. YAY! No more locks, keys or combinations! 
I'm so glad I'm a member! :)

My only complaint is that there needs to be more free parking for the members. Seriously!!!",2012-02-23T19:40:22Z,99
133,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"When I told my friend that I was going to check out the Robert Lee YMCA, the first thing he told was that his coworkers workout there.  He also said that his coworkers mentioned that exotic dancers workout there in the afternoons.  Interesting comment and I will leave it to you to interpret what that means. 

I dropped in for a tour recently where a staff member showed me around the facility and explained the membership rules.  The staff member was enthusiastic and open to questions.  I noticed that it was fairly busy at the machines already before 5 pm on weekday.  I was mostly interested in the group fitness classes and was surprised that some of the classes required an additional fee on top of the membership fee (eg, extra $15 for certain classes).  These classes were highlighted in black on their program schedule.  I wasn't too impressed with that because some of the classes I really wanted to join required that extra fee on top of a membership.  There is the option, however, is just to do the drop in class without the membership fee.

Some of the memberships require a $50 initiation fee like the young adult membership.  Unfortunately, the young adult membership cannot be placed on hold if you choose to not go to YMCA for a few months.  This means that if you cancel and rejoin you would pay the initiation fee again.  The adult membership is about $10 more than the young adult membership but you can place that membership on hold.

If you get the plus membership, you get extra perks like a separate changing room which has a private hot tub and steam room.  It is kind of like a spa changing room with hair dryers and large counter space with a mirror.  It was also much more spacious and less busy than the regular changing room.

It was nice that they offered a tour to prospective members but I am hesitant with the extra fees for the classes I want to take, the busy gym during times I want to visit, and the small changing room for regular memberships.  In contrast, the Richmond Oval is more spacious in gym space and locker space.",2011-11-29T18:48:55Z,99
134,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"Decent gym - very new equipment, repairs are done fast, very clean equipment and change rooms. 
It isn't a serious gym. Beware of fools. It's also downtown, so beware of rude middle easterners.


Can't comment on the pool, classes, or other services.",2016-02-03T05:12:21Z,99
135,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"I have been a member for 18 months now, after my old gym went belly up.  The facilities are very clean and well-maintained.  They have a lot of equipment for cardio and a good number of free weights and machines.  I am on a morning workout schedule, so it tends not to be too crowded when I am there, but there is the odd day where it seems everyone shows up at the same time wanting to do the same thing that I am doing.

I have friends who go later in the day and complain about the crowds, so I am glad that I am an early morning person.  Medium price for memberships.  There are cheaper, but you definitely get what you pay for.  Also not as pretentious or pick-up joint-like as other gyms can be.

Membership isn't just for one Y location, and I regularly use the Langara Y as well.  The Langara Y is definitely showing its age, especially in the change-rooms and building structure.  Each Y has its advantages/disadvantages over the other.",2012-05-27T05:31:07Z,99
136,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"A lovely new building with great facilities. They offer fantastic classes - pretty amazing given its all volunteers. They also have a little cafe on the ground floor run by Be Fresh Local Market and often they do discounts each day on different items which makes the selections there more affordable. It's all healthy and delicious, and a lot are organic so no matter what you will be happy!",2016-03-06T07:03:33Z,99

I find the child centre staff unmotivated and unengaged...two things you need when dealing with children. We recently had a very terrible experience with childminding. We witnessed an infant left unattended on a sofa with no staff in sight ""minding"" the infant. A toddler had time to pull the infant off the couch and finally the sound of the infant wailing alerted the staff to give the infant attention.  I am no longer comfortable leaving our child there.",2014-10-15T01:06:01Z,99

I came here for the first time over the weekend and got free entry for a first timer. The front desk people are really friendly and helpful. The change rooms are clean and equipped with lots of lockers (more lockers outside on the upper level as well). It does get busy due to the prime location and we faced some disgruntled gym rats but other than it was an overall positive experience.",2015-09-14T20:56:28Z,99
140,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"This place is still too overcrowded.  I've been to other downtown gyms (Fitness World, Steve Nash, Denman Fitness, Pantheon, YWCA) and none of them are as busy after work (5 PM to 9 PM).  Sure, the YMCA tells you that is you want to get a decent workout to go during their ""off peak"" times (9 AM to 11 AM and 1 PM to 3 PM) - but unless you're unemployed, work night shifts or are a student, it's really not practical or possible to go during these times.  Even though they are beyond capacity, they continue to sign up new members.  They should limit any new members that they can only go to the facility during the ""off peak"" times, to lessen the negative impact on already existing members.

The actual gym area is small, relative to other gyms in Vancouver.  Limited number of free weights and there is typically only one of each type of machine/equipment.  For example. there is only one flat bench press for the entire gym.  This causes it to take forever to get a workout done, since when there is only one of each machine, it takes a long time for it to become available to use.  They really need to start increasing the equipment they have.  They should have plenty of money to buy new equipment from all the new members they keep signing up.

The staff aren't very friendly or helpful either. I have seen so many people using equipment incorrectly, endangering not only their own safety but also those around them.  The staff never goes up to these people to inform them that they are working out incorrectly and that they could cause serious injury.",2011-03-04T16:03:20Z,99
141,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"Some goods, some bads, which balances out to 3 stars.

Goods:

- brand new, very well-maintained equipment. Everything looks new and almost always works - whenever something is broken it's fixed within a couple of days. The cleaning staff is always busy, even on weekends.

- excellent facilities: pool, gyms, weight rooms, yoga studio, tons of cardio equipment, two squash courts that expand to racquetball courts. Many classes that are included in membership. Frankly I can't think of anything exercise-related that they don't have, except maybe a track.

- well-trained and friendly staff. They are pretty knowledgeable and usually available.

- downtown location can't be beat.


Bads:

- the members. They are horrible. There will be people yakking on their phones, in your ear, whenever you go and whatever part of the gym you are in. There will be jerks nearly fighting over how good they are at basketball (newsflash: you all suck, which is why you don't play professionally). People don't put their weights in the right place, so you can never find what you're looking for (I'm convinced that either numeracy is dropping or these people are doing it on purpose). And worst of all, for some reason the latest fitness fads involve swinging heavy weights around your head, jumping on equipment benches, and walking your exercises around the gym, so you can't turn around without someone smacking into you or just generally being in your way (and doing something dangerous, besides). This happens when the gym is crowded (which is often), but amazingly enough, it's also a problem when the gym isn't crowded.

- the price. I have a ""young adult"" membership, which means I get a $10/month discount for being under 35. But I only get it once, which means that if I cancel it and then re-join, I have to pay full price forever. But my ""discounted"" membership is $51 per month, incl tax, which I think is a little expensive (although the staff and equipment are very good, see above). A regular membership at $61 a month would definitely be too much.


If they could somehow enforce courteous behaviour I wouldn't complain about the price. But as it is, I suppose it's the best value for a gym with squash courts in the downtown area, and I don't have people calling me on the phone to sell me upgrades like I did with another chain of fitness centers that I won't bother to mention. So until I find something better I will stay here.",2013-01-05T23:08:58Z,99
142,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"Great amenities for executive class! I've recently became a member and canceled my Steve Nash Membership. My friend took me here as a guest and it's been life changing. I work out and felt that there were not enough classes at Steve Nash Granville location and as it's getting busier the up keeping hasn't. I am now a Plus member at YMCA and truly love their options and classes. Yoga classes have been great - from Flow to Speed to Yin. The mens change room is always well kept. The best is that you never have to wait for a locker as you do at Steve Nash! Oh, they have a pool too! AWESOME!!",2013-04-22T08:28:20Z,99

144,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"Great place to workout in the city. Although booking a personal instructor to help you out is a long wait, everything else is 5 star worthy. They have great classes for members from cycling classes, yoga, boot camp and so much more! I've done a few and they're all helpful in getting yourself into shape. 
They have 2 levels of change rooms: the regular membership-showers and lockers, and the plus membership-pay a bit more per month and you get extra perks such as towel service, private hot tub and steam room in the room. But they also have a public hot tub and steam room by the pool so don't think you're missing out. 
This location has a basketball court which they occasionally book for classes or convert into badminton or volleyball courts and has  separate rooms for racketball/squash. It also has lots of new machines and friendly people who work at the help desks who can  show you how to use these machines. 
Overall this gym is great for all levels, individuals or groups.",2010-09-17T19:35:17Z,99

Our kids are swimming and they look forward to their lessons. 

I find the fitness classes top notch - great and knowledgeable instructors and my husband enjoys swimming laps before work in the mornings. Looking forward to exploring the after school drop in program and tae kwon do for the kiddos.

149,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"Almost two years in and this gym is still shiny and new! Maybe there are a lot of members like me (Pays for the full membership every month but only goes a handful of times a year).

Not this year though! I was gung ho to keep my new years resolution! For a bit at least...
Working out before 7am is great... Machines with individual teams, good selection of free cardio machines. Used to have an empty gym you could do your own exercises in but that seems to be used for a class now.

The showers are awful though... Sensored showers? Nothing says ""Good morning"" like stepping into the shower area with your gym clothes on and having a cold spray of water rain down on you fully clothed because you didn't know they were sensored. 
Once you get over that, have fun dancing around the shower trying to get the water to come back on again.
There is also nowhere private to put your towel and such. Option 1) Hang it outside the shower curtain and dry yourself off with everyone else or Option 2) Pull your towel in and risk it getting wet with the spastic sensor shower.

Since showering after my workouts wasnt ideal I thought I would try working out after work.
YIKES! Intimidatingly busy. 

I jumped ship and am now waiting for the Trevor Linden Club 16 to open. I'm sure it will be just as busy, but hopefully at least I'll be able to shower in peace at half the price.

In sum...
Pro: nice new equipment, membership card acts as a lock, cold water system, resusable towels to wipe down machines (not that people use them :P )
Con: busy, showers, cost, talk",2012-01-23T18:32:44Z,99

151,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"Typically I work out in a small gym and I didn't really feel the need to go to a bigger gym. But a friend of mine asked me if I wanted to go on her guest pass. So I went. I was very impressed by the new equipment and the vastness of this YMCA. I didn't realize how dated some of the equipment in my regular gym is. At the Y the treadmills actually had Bluetooth capacity to connect to my phone. Who knew this even existed? Obviously not me. They have eco-friendly towels to wipe down the machines which people were actually using.  It was quite busy in there but not overly so that i had to wait to use any of the equipment.  I worked out for about 2 1/2 hours and then spent half an hour in the steam room. At my regular gym I typically only work out for 1 1/2 hrs due the lack of varying equipment. So I got a great workout in at the Y. I'm only rating it a four out of five as I do think it is a little expensive. It's worth it if you're going to use everything such as the hot tub, steam room,  pool, gym and take the classes such as yoga,  and boot camp etc. However I would only use the gym in the steam room. That you can get at a another gym for much cheaper.",2017-02-27T19:40:46Z,99

Having just moved from the states where a majority would never think to go to the Y, this place blew me away. There are so many different cool classes offered there. 

Also, the pool is fantastic! Being a swimmer, I am picky about swimming in a clean pool and this one definitely is. Half of the pool also can be raised or lowered for classes and lessons. I have never seen nor heard of a pool that does that.

Definitely recommend!",2015-04-15T19:21:06Z,99

What a great place for him to develop in many different ways.  From the amazing staff to the programs for kids and adults, the childminding, swimming classes, it's truly a wonderful place for children. My issue lies here: ""Playtime""  it is such a great place to watch your child in all developmental aspects. What i believe is needed is a seperate space for babies and toddlers. They are in different development stages and ive witnessed and felt the wrath of many brand new, on edge, sleep deprived parent's who are not tolerant of the older kids kicking balls, throwing things, rough housing and basically being toddlers. Frankly I'm exhausted too from all their energy and going to playtime is a much needed break to regroup and recharge for an hour or 4!. Today as i sit in the gymnasium(indoor family playground) here at the Robert Lee YMCA watching my son play in his very energetic toddler way, I am happy and relieved that there are is only 1 child that doesn't walk yet and no babies crawling around. I hope staff are in fact redirecting parents and babies to the 5th floor to the other playtime area where they can't get injured by the rambunctiousness of the older kids. I mean they have 5hrs up there as opposed to the 1 hour here.  Theres still some kinks to be worked out,  what if a parent has an older and younger child..

160,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"First impression:

This place is fantastic! I only went once but wow was I impressed! Everybody was very friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed their pool and hot tub. Very clean for a public place. 

It put me in a great mood to be here. The swimming & hot-tub was great for my back & neck injury. I feel really grateful to have access to a place like this; I can't wait to go back!!",2014-09-04T18:59:07Z,99
161,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"Great gym. Clean facilities. No music blaring over the speakers.
Tons of machines. I have never waited for access to some kind of cardio equipment.

Members are pretty a pretty normal cross-section of the downtown area. Classes are good but I have started personal training with Brandon Hamilton too! He is great. Highly recommend him for pushing you out of your comfort zone.",2012-04-05T19:44:58Z,99
162,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"I'm in love with any gym that has decent cardio equipment and good classes, but I especially love this place because the facility is amazing (huge, brand new, top notch equipment), the classes are (mostly) very high quality and plentiful, and the price ($48/month) is very reasonable for what you get, especially when compared to the other large gyms downtown. I love the fact that they offer the discounted rate to under 35s in recognition of the high cost of living in downtown Vancouver, especially for people paying off a student loan and starting their first post-university full time job. Yes it is busy at peak times (like any gym), but I think that would be a common complaint in virtually all downtown gyms.",2011-02-22T06:59:08Z,99
163,Robert Lee YMCA,3.8,"Yes, sometimes it's extremely busy here. But for the price you're paying which includes use of the ozoned pool, yoga classes and fitness classes (there are only a couple that are extra fees) its kind of to be expected. I go here pretty much every week day (a twice a day a lot) and at least one weekend day. I do a lot of the yoga, weight and cardio group classes as I get bored working out on my own. The instructors are amazing and take the time to get to know you. If you're a regular they will push you harder and help you out if they know you can do better by giving you advanced moves. They also listen to suggestions and change things frequently. I've read lots of reviews saying the staff are awful, but I've never found that. Both the volunteers and paid staff are great and more then pleasant to talk to and ask questions. Some of them even get mad at me if I don't show up to a regular class :) they actually want you to be there. Which is a great feeling. 

The free weight section is getting better and they have more then enough cardio equipment for the cardio junkies. 

Sometimes it's hard to find a space, but in the mornings and afternoons it's usually okay. I never go between 5-7 because my schedule allows me to go any time and I choose 6am and around noon so as to avoid the worst of the crowds.

Oh, I did read reviews that the showers suck... Yeah, they do. But for me it isn't that big of a deal and the awesomeness of everything else makes up for it. :D  Also, the pool is a little small for lap swimming if you are going any real distance, I use it for after training just to get in a couple lengths after. And use the aqua center for my real swim training. So for those two reasons I gave it a 4 instead of a 5... 

Love it here though!  In fact, I just got home from here :)",2012-04-19T23:12:04Z,99

165,Kitsilano Pool,4.5,"A great local salt water public pool in the Kitsilano neighbourhood and surprisingly not as expensive as you think! It's $7.50~ and you can get combo tickets for similar prices for an adult and child or adult and senior!

Parking on Vine or Balsam will be better than paying for parking in the Kitsilano lot but give yourself advanced time to find it if you're hoping for free parking. Beautiful view overlooking Kitsilano Beach, the water and North Shore Mountains. 

Spacing was great. There are a lot of people doing lane swimming practice so be careful and aware of the marked areas or expect to be spoken to over the megaphone of the life guard. 

Bring a blanket and snacks to dry off around the side. 
Depth is up to 8 feet in some areas. 

We have gone three times in the past month and the process has been super easy purchasing tickets online and lining up near the Kitsilano Boatshow theatre to get in. I recommend prebooking tickets instead of link by up for drop in in the off chance you cannot get in!",2021-09-04T16:05:42Z,37

Kitsilano Pool  a pool which draws from the ocean and therefore is filled with salt water. It opened at the water's edge in 1931 and became an instant success. It been updated since then and got a face-lift  for the 1986 World's Fair.

However, this pool did leave me disappointed with its seemingly freezing temperatures (even on a hot day) and relatively small size (at least for non-lap swimming). While I did appreciate the grassy hills for lounging when not in the water, I found that I spent most of my time lying on the grass beside the pool rather than actually in the pool.

A gradient floor makes it very easy for a 2.5 year-old to play in the shallow area of the water without any dangers. A mini slide went in to the water, too. 
Separate from the big pool is a toddler zone/spray park.

179,Kitsilano Pool,4.5,Swimming is my calling my passion and my way of life . Kitsilano pool has shown me swimming is much more than just a pool a lifeguard and a bit of chlorine. I arrived to the pool in my new sexy speedo and swam multiple lengths at ultra speed. The feeling of the water wasn't itchy on the skin and The water even had an after taste of sea salt. The view of the ocean was remarkable and calming . The food was quite garbage not exotic enough for my liking . Can't wait to return again.,2020-04-04T21:50:22Z,37
180,Kitsilano Pool,4.5,"This pool used to get a 5 star rating from me.  It is amazing - 137.5 meters (12 lengths /6 laps for a mile!) and a great layout.  Kids can wade in like a beach, and a rope separates the waist deep (for short people, anyways) from the swimming lanes and deep end, where you can go off slides or dive off the edge in certain areas.

My favourite part is the pool.  The lane swimming is two thick black lines that you can follow along the center and faster swimmers can pass up the middle, while slower swimmers will move out to the sides (hint hint to the occasional breast stroker and lolly-gagger who may not realize this well-known protocol).

VPB generally has a good crew of lifeguards keeping an eye on things, and the place is usually maintained very well.

Recently, the wind screen seems to be making it a much warmer place to swim!

My two detractors from a five-star rating would be the dirty factor of the pool bottom.  It does not appear that maintenance was done (or properly sanded and painted) in the past year or two.  And, that's been since day 1!  There are boot prints at the south-east end of the swimming lanes that have not moved (possibly pasty sediment that will just remain until the next major maintenance... next year we hope!).

Secondly, the height of the showers in the female change room.  I am fairly short in the sports world (not triathletes so much), around 5'9.  Tall for a girl, but there are many taller women out there!  The showers whack my head every time.  I need to practically squat as I arch backwards to rinse off and shower.  These were installed not ten plus years ago, when they used to be much higher!  

It would be terrific to see the city acknowledge that taller people in both the Vancouver  Aquatic Center and Kits Pool (all VPB locations, really) would benefit from having proper installation of showers at varying heights, or higher heights as a short person won't have an issue with a taller shower head, while a taller person is a liability (and we as taxpayers would foot any bill, whether we know about it or not!).",2014-05-31T17:35:16Z,37
181,Kitsilano Pool,4.5,"I like this pool. I think it's about 137 m so it'd really helpful to pace yourself. 

I'm used to swimming in lanes and need the lines to guide me. There are only 2 black lines and it's supposed to be clear between them but the really fast swimmers tend to go up and down that area. Sorry, I need to be close enough to see the black line or I'd be all over the place. There are some really aggressive swimmers there. One time, a pregant woman got kicked in her belly and the guy didn't even acknowledge her. 

I go around 9am because there is a rush of people around 7-8am, trying to get in their workout before going to work, I guess. At around 10am, the kids arrive. 

There aren't any private showers and there are never enough for the masses that go through. 

It's too bad the season is so short! Also, remember to bring your tinted goggles. The first time I came with my clear goggles and was blinded by the white bottom. It's still pretty bright with my black goggles.",2010-08-28T05:33:48Z,37

The view of the North Shore Mountains and the ocean as you come up for air is amazing. In early Sept I had a near-religious experience there during an early-morning swim. The sun was just rising as I started a length heading east. As I raised my head out of the water to breathe, the sun hit my outstretched arm, turning it golden. It blew me away!

There's a locker room with restrooms and plenty of places to lounge.

They do have pool noodles to borrow, however, I am not good at sharing, therefore, I bring my own.

187,Kitsilano Pool,4.5,"This pool is lovely and salty and splendid. I went yesterday on a hot, post-work evening, with the sun just beginning to drop behind the mountains. The pool was bathed in golden light, with the ocean crashing just beyond. It was the best choice I could have made after a tiring day.

I swam a few (extraordinarily long!) lengths of the pool then moved over to the non-lane area to wade around and generally sun myself. The pool is so large that everyone has plenty of room. It was fairly busy when I was there but it did not have that awkward, crowded bathtub feel of many public pools.  There is also plenty of area on the cement pool-side to spread out your towel and take a break. Lots of people were tanning or reading.

The water is a crystal clear blue, so it's a bit of a surprise when it splashes against your lips and you realize it's salty. It's ocean fed as well as freshly-sourced for a mellow combination of ocean and public-health-mandated chlorination. If you are sensitive to chlorine this pool ought to be totally fine. After I left my skin did not have that odd 'tight' feeling excessive chlorination gives it, and my eyes did not burn at all during or after my swim. 

Like all Vancouver public pools it's $5.15 (adult) to get in, which makes me grumble a bit. Am I just a cheap bastard or does that seem like a buck or two more than a tax-payer-funded pool should be? It's a bit steep to spend that two or three times a week in any case. I gotta look into the price of a book of passes or something like that. 

The only other downfall of my trip to the pool was the women's change room was dismally wet and untidy. Everything from the changing room benches to the tabletops was wet and there was forgotten socks and unflushed toilets and discarded odds and ends everywhere. Maybe it was because I arrived towards the end of the day, but still. Run a mop around that schniz a few times a day, employees!

But all in all this is quite a great pool in an incomparable setting! Next on my list: the similar set-up they have over at Second Beach.",2009-05-30T16:18:08Z,37

193,Kitsilano Pool,4.5,"This large outdoor pool is OK for lap swimmers and great for families with kids as it is a truly huge swimming pool -- 137 metres -- and the water is kept ""clean"" (ha-ha, what can you expect with a large public bathing pool) with salt water instead of nasty smelly chlorine.   It is located grassy park along the shoreline so the location is very popular with sunbathers and others who like to read, relax and hang out.

Pool hours were listed as 7:00am - 8:45pm weekdays and 8:00am - 8:45am weekends, but as the pool is summer-only, it's best to check the website at http://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/kitsilano-pool-schedule.aspx

This pool's very long distance of 137 metres indicates it is an older pool, built in the days of English measurements as a roughly 150-yard pool. 

If you are a lap swimmer you have to let go of enjoying the usual lap-lane courtesies that exist in a pool which has swim lane dividers and a regular circular flow.  Random swimmers do some times disrupt the flow of traffic and there are lots of kids of course, but even they tend to see that there are a huge number of ""lap swimmers"" going in a circle and they thus tend to stay out of the way.  But not to worry, the pool is plenty wide so there is lots of room for those who just want to soak, frolic, play, or just float, especially if they are doing it off to one side, to avoid the lap-swim traffic if it gets heavy.

Two nearby pools compete for attention of swimmers, both across the bay from Kitsilano:  Second Beach Pool, also outdoor and thus seasonal, and the Vancouver Aquatic Centre, both of a more conventional size for a public pool.

Second Beach Pool is more concrete-y and definitely more devoted to lap swimmers, though there is room for everyone and a completely separate area for non-lap swim activities;  the water, for some reason, has a huge ""current"" so as you swim laps there is a strong chance of being drifted over into the hard plastic swim lanes, and swimming one direction will be falsely easy and in the opposite direction you are swimming against the current.  The water seems to be kept quite fresh and clean.

VAC pool -- right by the Burrard St. Bridge -- is made for lap swimmers and also has a gym and hot co-ed jacuzzi.  Open 11 months of the year it is very popular but its water ""quality"" is, let's say, harder to maintain due to heavy daily usage.",2013-06-18T17:46:30Z,37

203,UBC Aquatics Centre,2.9,"As someone who frequents the Aquatic Centre and enjoys this facility, I really wish I could give them a 5/5. Compared to many aquatic centres, this one is really great. But they still have a lot of flaws. 

For one, the showers. None of the shower curtains actually close. The water jets blow them away as soon as they're turned on. There might as well be no shower curtains. (Also, there are not enough showers. Even the YMCA has more.) Plus, the water is usually lukewarm. 

Another thing is the swimming lanes (the ones under the diving board). These are the ones that are usually available most times, but they're crowded half the time. It's hard to swim continually because you're always having to be aware of everyone in your lane. If they arranged the lanes better, this could be solved. 

The good about the UBC Aquatic Centre still trumps the negative, because as swimming pools go, this one is pretty great. It's free for students, for one (even in the summer)! The abundance and size of facilities (steam, sauna, hot tub, whirlpool, etc) and the cleanliness of it all. The bleachers are also an awesome place to study, nap, whatever - the chlorine smell is barely there. It's an overall great place that I enjoy spending time in.

They have public swimming at night but the issue is that only the shallow water area open. Women changing room, is very lacking. Lots of locker stall (free of charge for day use). Inside the washroom is not very appealing looking. Very run down and kind of disgusting looking in some ways. As well, I don't get why water is so hot. There is no freedom to adjust water temperature. Yes I was showering in super hot water. Too hot water. Not only that water tap in the basin are mostly not working. Cold water tap are broken. Soap runs low or out for some. 

Showering area very open. I had to shower with my  swimming suit on.",2016-09-14T15:57:43Z,8

206,UBC Aquatics Centre,2.9,"I would normally give this 4 or 5 stars but I am not because when they built the new Aquatics Centre they never replaced the outdoor pool that was there before. 
In a city that already lacks outdoor pools compared to Toronto and Montreal I find it very sad that just because of ""high precipitation levels"" they decided to scrap it, but the thing is that when Vancouver has lovely warm weather, people would prefer the option to be able to swim outdoors and to feel and smell the air instead of the inside chlorine smell of an indoor pool. 
For this reason, I will only ever visit this place during the winter months, if at all..BOO on them for not even including a smaller outdoor component!!",2019-06-12T18:53:44Z,8
207,UBC Aquatics Centre,2.9,"For a world class university, the UBC Aquatic Centre is definitely lacking. 

The basic bits:
-standard 25mm and 50mm indoor interchangeable indoor pool, whirlpool, sauna, steam room, diving boards, and a 50mm seasonal outdoor pool.  
-open to the public at a variety of price structures depending if you are affiliated with UBC, if you are a student elsewhere, and if your general public. 
-lessons for kiddies and adults

The lacking bits:
-the pool is straight up just chlorinated, full strength bleach, which leaves me smelling like a bottle of bleach
-absolutely no hot (or even warm) showers. I have never hard a decently heated shower here
-there are puddles of water in the locker room because of poor drainage
-there are very specific hours when we can swim, because the university uses the pool for their swim team and classes
-and everything is just old and rusty

The redeeming bits:
-the outdoor seasonal pool is nice for lap swimming and not as crowded as the other outdoor pools
-overall the indoor pool has deeper waters than most city pools
-the staff and lifeguards there are nice people
-I swim there for 'free' because it is apart of my student fees as a UBC student

I have heard that there is a new pool planned for construction in the future. Hopefully the new pool will be better, too bad I won't be a student when it is completed.",2012-10-06T16:23:33Z,8
208,UBC Aquatics Centre,2.9,"I was excited by the opening of the new pool at UBC. Don't get me wrong, the facilities are nice. But the kids lessons and lack of respect by the instructors for children in the pool is appalling. Maybe because the instructors are students, our last set of lessons basically had a different person every time. One of them actually left 3-year olds at the hot tub. Luckily, we spotted them and went to get them. I asked for help in supporting my son to become comfortable with putting his face in the water and she basically said that he just needed to dunk his head in. After sucking in a bunch of water, he wasn't prepared to do it again. They recently were ""training"" new instructors by running into the kids side of the pool and splashing the little ones without any disregard for the little kids. It was pretty shocking to see the little kids' faces. My little guy is so traumatized that he won't go back.",2018-08-07T23:27:44Z,8

They're basically saying, ""Get fit your way, fam.""

Now, let's spill the tea about that track with artificial grass - it's not just boujee; it's a whole vibe. You can break a sweat without worrying about getting down and dirty.

Right to the floor that were expected to walk on in our bare feet! Especially during a global pandemic. Cmon guys - this is basic health stuff to grasp.

The other levels at Minoru were poorly executed. There was 1 good teacher, a couple average, and some that clearly didn't enjoy working with young kids. The main cause for concern was the turnover of instructors. Other than the first class at watermania, the subsequent classes at minuru failed to have the same instructor for all 10 classes. Time was wasted, lesson planning continuity suffered and the student progression was poor. Instructor commitment was lackluster. His last level had 1 teacher for 6 students, this combined with unorganized lessons from ever-rotating instructors left little time for student improvement.",2013-09-25T08:34:46Z,12

225,Killarney Community Centre,3.6,"I'm giving this place 4 stars for the pool, ice rink and how many happy kids I saw. We'll talk about that stuff first. 

The pool is the main attraction here. They've got a large play area, and in the main pool 75% was dedicated to leisure swimming. They had 3 lanes in the other 25% for swimming laps, a stream room and a hot tub both of which were exceptionally hot :-) and the whole place was swarming with smiling kids - i mean, geez, they've got so much play space, diving boards, even a water slide! Made me wish I was 12.

Didn't see the ice arena, but i'm sure it gets good use if the pool is any indication. 

The fitness centre lacks, wants, and needs. No rack, not much weight (i'm not a muscle guy and they didn't have enough for me) and a really tiny space crammed with machines. They have 5 treadmills, which is more than Brittania or Trout Lake or False Creek, all of which are at least twice the size of this place. Not my first choice for weight training, but that's not what this place is geared towards, so it's not as though they missed their mark",2013-02-09T02:37:49Z,19

The 6:00PM classes are available on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursdays, but make sure you check before going in case they change the times.

230,Killarney Community Centre,3.6,"Vancouver is very well endowed with public swimming pools of all shapes, sizes and ages. Most have their strengths, and all have their weaknesses, but Killarney is one of the best for family fun. It has a genuine, if modest, water slide and a large warm shallow splash pool with a fast-flowing 'river of mild peril' for the smaller kids to enjoy. But it also has a reasonable sized regular pool for laps and diving. Finally, it comes with the obligatory hot tub and sauna complete with old people in saggy swimming costumes straight from central casting.

Like most of the newer pools, Killarney has a purpose-built family change room area. Unfortunately it's so popular that it's often hard to find an empty cubicle for changing - particularly the ones with the private showers. However, it beats having to take the boys into the mens room which, in common with men's change rooms everywhere, has a resident population of creepy-looking guys. Or perhaps it's just that all men look creepy when they're naked.

Definitely a kid friendly pool and not nearly as busy as Hillcrest.  There was a waterslide for the big kids/adults and a mini slide for the little ones. 
Parking was easy, the only thing that would make this a 5* is if they had larger change rooms.

Some other centres only allow 30 mins. In addition, they have a helium tank for balloons. Unfortunately, they were out of the helium tank for the weekend we had it booked, so that was too bad.

234,Killarney Community Centre,3.6,"Underwhelming is the best way to describe the Killarney Community Centre swimming pool programs and facilities.

The facilities are so-so. The pool is okay, the leisure pool is okay. The hot tub is really sub-par - too small and the jacuzzi jets hardly have any pressure at all.

The one redeeming feature at the pool is the steam room. It is always hot (sometimes even verging on too hot). But it's the only reason I go here.

That's because even though I live not quite 10 minutes away, I don't use the pool for fitness activities because there are no deep water fitness aquafit classes there. There have not been any offered there since I've lived in this neighbourhood since 2004. And I have asked on more than one occasion if they ever plan to add them - the answer is always ""no.""

Neither do they have a ""length swim"" lane designated for water running, like some pools do.

The locker rooms - at least the men's locker room - also suffer from a design flaw that does not allow the water to drain properly, so the floor is always very wet. And anything you drop on it ... well, you can figure it out.

I only go to the steam room there on the rare occasion I can't get to Hillcrest for a workout. I go there after participating in a low-impact aerobics class at the nearby Champlain Community Centre. The CCC does not have a hot tub or steam room so I head to Killarney to ease my body strains from the dry land fitness activity.

I can't speak to the other aspects of the facility or programs, as I've never participated in them, although my companion, the Divine Ms. K., does enjoy the belly dance classes she's participated in there. However, that is not a program run by the centre; rather, a room in the centre is booked by another organization for the activity.

But the pool - well, it doesn't make me drool. 

Sorry, Killarney. This is the aquatic facility I'm least likely to use in Vancouver and area, at least of the five or six I've been to more than once or twice.",2012-04-15T07:55:27Z,19

236,Killarney Community Centre,3.6,"Been coming here on the weekend the last few weeks for public swim, pretty nice pool. I think it was renovated a few years ago probably longer for the olympics and it looks really nice. The public swim is busy more on the little kids side with the slide and random pool fixtures but the adult side is not too crowded. We usually go in the afternoon to avoid all the big crowds. My gf does the lane swimming but the distance is a little long for me so I tend to stick to the actual pool itself and I swim my own lanes. There are 3 changerooms which is convenient, mens' womens, and the universal for families. We usualyl share a locker and just wear our swim suits under our clothes so we like to use the universal one. If you forget to bring a quarter you can put your stuff in the cubbies directly in front of the pool so you can keep an eye on it. Obviously don't bring anything valuable or worth stealing.

248,Edmonds Community Centre,3.7,"This is my 2nd review of Edmonds Community Centre. Somehow, My 1st review has it's own listing and is not grouped with all the other ""Edmonds Community Centre"" reviews, and Yelp keeps suggesting I review Edmonds Community Centre as though I haven't already done so. That said, My 1st review could use an update as times have changed, so I'll kill two birds with one stone; end the suggestions I review this place, and update my previous review. 

Edmonds is an extremely well equipped, large facility with a great aquatic centre, nice gym, lots of programs, and friendly staff. The building is only a few years old and so most everything is newish and clean and functions. It is centrally located and has ample parking both street side and underground. 

When it opened it was certainly among the best places to go work out. a huge field for running, a pool to swim laps, and a great weight room. Seems everybody thought the same thing, though, and now it's routinely packed. It appears as though everyone from Bonsor didn't hesitate to move right over once Edmonds' new digs was discovered, and the opening of Trevor Linden's ultra-affordable Club 16 did essentially nothing to ease the influx.

Despite being so large and well equipped, you can never the less expect lengthy waits for benches, treadmills, et cetera. Be prepared to bump knees with other patrons in the hot tub, pool and sauna. Even just getting in, they have a system in place where a staff member needs to physically scan your card and place the admittance bracelet on your wrist prior to entry. They could really take a page out of Hillcrest's playbook to streamline that process, as spending 10 minutes in line needlessly is never fun.

All that said, I can only dock one star from my previous review. The high volume of people speaks truly to how desperately this area was in need of this facility, and as nice as it is I wouldn't blame anyone for ever going there. For me, however, it's back to Bonsor; now that Edmonds has caught on, by comparison Bonsor feels like you have the place to yourself.",2016-02-13T01:48:48Z,27
249,Edmonds Community Centre,3.7,"Brand new facilities, although a little small (steam room, sauna, hot tub) this is a gorgeous new pool. Lots of fun for little ones with the lazy river and shallow pools, and plenty of lap lanes open for adults. I really enjoyed all the deck chairs for snoozing near the hot tub. Parking can be a bit difficult as we usually see all the underground parking is full before driving around the surrounding streets to find somewhere to park.",2016-01-20T18:05:59Z,27
250,Edmonds Community Centre,3.7,"Great community centre!  I dont really like to commit to a gym membership, community centre's a great and affordable.  My first time here since it opened maybe couple years ago.   Nice and clean, new, and friendly staff.  Im training for a marathon and when it snows in the lower mainland its hard too run outside.  I came in originally as a drop in to use the treadmills, but I was convinced to sign up for 10 drop in days.  For $60 you cant go wrong.  You have access to all Burnaby community centres, pool, saunas, weight rooms, exercise classes, and so much more.  Free parking, .25 locker, (warning some lockers dont work I lost a quarter ), weight room has plenty of machines and weights.  I often hate going to the gym being surrounded by people who all look like bodybuilders or supermodels.  Not here, a lot of seniors and normal people just wanting to workout.   I loved it.  Overall, it provided me with what I needed and more.  Hours are great too.  Currently  the pool in under maintenance, they are recommending you visit Bonsor until its up and running.",2020-01-17T23:42:34Z,27
251,Edmonds Community Centre,3.7,"This community centre is a hub for physical and intellectual endeavours with the library, fitness areas and pool. The fitness center is spacious and has lots of free weights. The pool is brings Watermania to the residents of Burnaby. 

I put a deduction for the lockers because they all require a quarter, which means that you will have to pay and carry a key around. I really do not want to pin or carry a key on my swimsuit.",2018-03-05T03:47:28Z,27
252,Edmonds Community Centre,3.7,"Friendly, helpful desk staff.
The weight room is clean and plenty of machines with good variety - weight machines and kettlebells, cardio equipment (treadmill, stationary bikes-upright and recumbent, rowing machine, elliptical, step climbing).  Free weights area has free weights, Bosu, Swiss balance balls, weighted medicine balls, foam rollers, balance boards, mats, you get the idea.
Tried the different fitness classes.  I only enjoyed a couple of them -- the instructor makes all the difference in whether the class will be fun as well as challenging.  Same goes for the aqua aerobics classes.",2018-07-28T14:48:18Z,27
253,Edmonds Community Centre,3.7,"Worst designed changing rooms ever for a newer pool serving a fast growing community!!

Men's changing is TINY!  The guys are cheek to cheek in a U shaped area!

Universal Change room is open to anyone wants peer in.  The shower rooms here are tiny and the shower water flows out of the shower section into the 'changing' section where is supposed to be dry!! It's plain bad, bad design.

The pool area is great though!  Kids have to be 8 in order to swim alone.

The main entrance, hallway to the rec center is wide and open! Some of this space should have been allocated to the pool changing areas....",2017-04-10T00:36:38Z,27
254,Edmonds Community Centre,3.7,"Brand new community center that opened up less than 5 years ago. I have a lot of friends in the Burnaby area and this is close to the station, however, was disappointed with the programs offered and the specific program that I took. The center itself looks really nice and shiny. Modern and clean. I used to come here for some of the aqua programs earlier, however, they cancelled one program, replaced another and switched instructors which was horrible. I thought that it was just that one area. The public swim times have changed which makes it inaccessible for the working class in general. I did do the gym drop in which was the only redeemable program here. There was enough equipment and I was able to get a mini circuit in while the billing was being sorted out at my regular gym. General front desk staff has always been helpful.",2018-02-24T20:31:29Z,27
255,Edmonds Community Centre,3.7,"Edmonds! We love you! This community centre has honestly ruined all others for me. It is simply a beautiful facility. It is exceptionally clean, new bright, and well maintained. The staff are knowledgable, helpful, and seem super enthusiastic about their work (excepting a few questionable interactions with the front desk staff). There is a ton of programming and initiatives for community involvement. The pool is what we mainly use the centre for and it is beautiful. It's so bright and fun and there are many features for my toddler to enjoy including a lazy river and a play structure in the shallow end. 

Downsides to the pool: the giant bucket that dumps water on your head every 5 minutes. What is UP with that?? Who decided that was fun? It terrifies my son and frankly it stresses me out. The other downside is that many people use the spray areas of the kids pool as a massage opportunity which causes water to spray in all directions including the children's faces and eyes. Some life guards address this and others don't. Total crap shoot. 

We recently began attending a toddler dance class at Edmonds and are LOVING it! Lisa is a kick-ass instructor who genuinely cares about the children and their learning through movement. My son has absolutely blossomed in this class. 
We also use the indoor and outdoor playgrounds, the cafe, the Saturday play gym, and honestly sometimes we just cruise through the centre because it's a nice environment.",2016-05-14T07:54:13Z,27
256,Edmonds Community Centre,3.7,"A great place to be for young families on cold rainy days. There you can find:

- indoor swimming pool with slides and spray features.
- open gym for kids with random toys (once or twice a week only)",2016-03-30T02:24:13Z,27
257,Edmonds Community Centre,3.7,Well more evidence of a good thing gone bad. Been going to aquasizes here since 2014 but been away for about a year to come back to a total changed program. It's been widely known that the management sucks at this pool and I see why. All the good  instructors have been leaving since  2014. The adult aquasize classes have been reduced in frequency. The pool was a shambles the 3 days I attended this week. I was annoyed when no evening classes are being held on Tuesday or Thursdays anymore and no deep on Wed. Thankfully the 2 instructors I did attend classes were awesome. A glimmer of hope.,2017-09-07T20:14:32Z,27

259,Edmonds Community Centre,3.7,"The best indoor pool in Burnaby. Incredibly massive and a lot of life guards. Very attentive life guards. Front staff (older white lady) wasn't very interactive and jolly for a kid environment facility though but everyone's got a rough day sometimes. Family change room is perfect, some rooms have the toddler/baby seat with seat belt for when dad and mom showers, all in one changing room. Spacious. Love this place and my kids enjoyed it. Make sure your kids are at least wearing slippers though even by the pool. There's also a jacuzzi far back corner (a bit cramped), huge slide, and lap pool. Great facility to come for ALL ages. Even has waiting area inside the pool at the cost (you can't swim) while your older kid goes and play by themselves inside the pool). Lots of life jackets available and floaters. Easy in and easy out. It's all what parents want ultimately and have a seamless experience and not too expensive.",2019-06-19T22:01:07Z,27
260,Edmonds Community Centre,3.7,"I like the pool here. The gym is alright, would like more standards held of people putting weights away.

A dip in the pool is just the way to start a Saturday.",2016-03-24T18:02:21Z,27
264,Edmonds Community Centre,3.7,"I recently started coming here regularly as it is close to my new job, so it's easy to stop on the way home from work. It's a great facility, with a large and very well-equipped gym that is usually not too busy. Needs more room for floor work though- the only space is by the front doors and it's pretty small compared to amount of people the gym can hold. Gets crowded with more than a handful of mats.

Very nice pool, good jacuzzi except I wish it had better jets like at Eileen Dailly- which is probably the best public hot tub in the lower mainland. I like that the pool here at Edmonds has a large supply of training tools like hand paddles. Beware that on Wednesday nights it is $1.00 swim- PACKED and nigh impossible to get a spot in the jacuzzi or do any serious lengths.

Nice staff, most clientele seems pretty friendly and a good range of different types of people- no need to feel intimidated by steroid monkeys here!

My one complaint has been mentioned by others on Yelp- the men's changing room is WAY too small and cramped. Even adding a small tiered bench in the middle of the seating area would allow more room to change and put your gear down- it's always a total hassle. Whoever designed this space had NO idea what they were doing. But that's my only gripe- good place to go for sure. Lots of other areas like basketball courts etc if that's your thing. Free underground parking (if you can find a spot) and lots of free street parking also. 

And I'm looking forward to summer when all those huge windows will let the sun stream in!",2016-01-16T11:29:46Z,27
265,Edmonds Community Centre,3.7,Went there last week and I was impressed by the fact that it was clean and cheap at the same time. The slides were fantastic until someone vomited. Good thing they work fast and cleaned it in no time.,2017-08-09T14:36:14Z,27
266,Edmonds Community Centre,3.7,"I have been going to this community center since it opened in 2013. 

Its nice to enjoy a facility that is new and modern.  
 
Like most community centers in the lower mainland, Edmonds has many programs and activities for almost everyone of all ages.  We ( the residents of BC)  are lucky to have many facilities like this,  so very affordable and always close-by. 

I do have issue with a few things i noticed here. 

1) on the second level, there is a common area where people can look down onto the lobby below. its where the vending machine and drinking fountain are located.  The height of the fence at the edge of the floor is quite low. seems very unsafe and perhaps irresponsible at about 3 feet high. (just above my waist level)  Especially since this area is across from the rooms used for kids and seniors activities.


2) i have to agree with Nathan I...the change rooms for the pool are way too small and offer very little privacy. if there are 5-6 people changing all at once....its reached maximum capacity for the area. And the entrance is too open. as soon one turns a corner, just a few feet off the common hallway (and not far from the womens area), you are right in the area where the lockers are and the males are changing. Its was a bit of a shock for the first visit.

The drainage is poor in this changing area. -To avoid the pooling water, some are opting to stand on the benches to change.  Thusly, becoming fully exposed to all around the area. Very uncomfortable, especially for the younger ones. 
 I recommend bringing slippers or a mat to stand on. I will next time for sure! I did however, pack my bathrobe, so i did get a bit of privacy.

3) coffee /snack shop closed on a Saturday at about 2pm? not sure if thats a regular occurrence.",2014-03-08T16:48:46Z,27
267,Edmonds Community Centre,3.7,"Facility is very new.  This place seems to be a perfect place for Everyone. I will drop by for work outs every day , and every day of the week the gym downstairs is being used for something else, from families with kids riding their little bikes (sheltering them from rain) to seniors doing work outs for them, to table tennis, badminton, basketball for the youth, indoor soccer for the kids.  Lots of space and room for other stuff, like dance classes and music classes.  I mainly use the gym.  Very nice equipment, for a place that is a community centre, it pretty much has everything you want in a gym.  Keep in mind this is a ""community centre"" gym so it does get packed very quickly.   And because it's a community centre gym, there are some creepers thought which is annoying, since all they do is checking you out like wtf man.  Yea I know I'm doing athlean x but still.  Had to chance to go as early as 7 am and I thought it was quite busy.  The men's change room is way to small.  Walked in only to see a but naked guy because of the limited space .

It was mainly ladies being active and doing dance moves to Broadway tunes. At the end, we were doing stretches and Stevie Wonder's song ""I just called to say I love you"" was playing. EVERYONE sang the chorus. It was just great!",2013-10-23T04:02:33Z,27

Our family attended a children's party that some friend's of ours held in the Cyprus room and we were impressed.  The staff were friendly and engaged the kids as well as the adults, the toys were in excellent shape and the whole area was clean.  By area I am referring to the play area, kitchen and the washrooms.  There's even a playground right outside the room if you want your kids to get some fresh air.

If you're thinking of hosting your child's birthday party, I highly recommend this community centre.",2015-03-23T13:59:13Z,3
