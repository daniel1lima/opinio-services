0,Twelvewest,1.9,"First, after reading all the other reviews, I assume people don't go out much to nightclubs. 

First, have an understanding of what nightlife people deal with on a nightly basis, the stress and aggravation of drunk people, brash intoxicated people that don't reason or have common sense. 

I've had nothing but great experiences here, and this is my 5th or 6th annual trip to stop by. It's realistically one or two or three clubs worth while in Vancouver and the one that has the best diversity both in design (lounge bar up front, VIP bar in back, with elevated VIP area for bottle service and dancefloor) and demographic.. As some clubs in van are predominately all asian etc. Twelve west is a welcomed mix. 

With any club, they look for the crowd they want, and to some people thats insulting, but unfortunately.. That's the way nightlife can be. Be it new York, Miami, or Vancouver... Deal with it and get over yourself.  

I'll continue to support and recommend twelve west.. And enjoy more drunken shenanigans.",2019-12-21T19:32:55Z,45
1,Twelvewest,1.9,"Our bottle girl was amazing, I was disappointed that they weren't checking bands and the table section was packed full of people, people on our table etc. and we found out the bottle girl doesn't get the tip.",2023-03-25T07:54:00Z,45
2,Twelvewest,1.9,"Got groped and was physically abused for refusing advances from a couple of middle aged guys - management did not do anything so would not recommend, spend your money at a place that does something to take care of their guests.",2023-01-30T05:52:15Z,45
3,Twelvewest,1.9,"One of the many nightclubs in the Granville entertainment district.

Parking here is almost non-existent.  Best to walk over from somewhere.

The theme is a bit interesting, with the funky floor pattern and chandeliers.  There are screens at the back showing old movies or something.

The front bar is quite impressive.  Runs almost the entire length of the place.  There is a smaller bar at the back where the lineup is much shorter.

Music is a bit too loud to chat while drinking.  Seating is better than most places.",2017-09-18T01:36:16Z,45
4,Twelvewest,1.9,"On this past Saturday, May 14th, my stepdaughters and I went to this venue. Unfortunately as we walked there we witnessed a fight between two women on the street close by. Many people (mostly men) were gathered around, videoing them and saying derogatory things about - and to - the women. What we didn't know as we walked by was that at least two of those men gathered were bouncers from this establishment. As we arrived to the line, all the guys around us were talking about the fight, again in a derogatory fashion (""she looks like a s**t anyways""). The two men came jogging back from the scene where the doorman asked ""did you guys see anything?"" and the response was ""not really, just their weaves on the ground"". The men were laughing and looking at video footage. Us, as three women, felt very uncomfortable; and quite frankly unsafe; staying anywhere near the venue. We left the line, not wanting to give business to a place that employs people who conduct themselves in this way.
As bouncers, you'd think the immediate response would be to help break up the fight- not video, laugh, and say terrible things.
I'm not sure what I'm hoping to accomplish by sharing this information, but I will be sharing this experience anywhere I can leave a review for Twelve West.

5,Twelvewest,1.9,"Very rude staff. Don't bother with this place. They will make up some random reason to not let you in, based on age or looks. For us it was because we were 25-30 years old. Inside is only 19 year olds standing around not knowing what to do with themselves. Terrible vibe and music.",2022-04-26T05:23:52Z,45
6,Twelvewest,1.9,"I came to this club tonight to celebrate my best friends birthday and i was FORCED to coat check my jacket as it is ""club policy"". Upon checking my coat, i was told EACH item was 3$, so 3$ a jacket and 3$ a scarf. That is completely inappropriate, I'm visiting from CALIFORNIA, it's freezing here. I should NOT be subjected to paying extra for the Canadian cold. When i entered the club i saw MANY people wearing coats. See attached photos. I was told to speak with the manage Jessie. I am extremely disappointed with the treatment.",2018-12-02T06:18:49Z,45
7,Twelvewest,1.9,"Please do not step foot in this place. My friends and I visited Vancouver this past weekend and came to Twelve West because it was close to our rental. Not only was the staff RUDE AND RACIST, but they also had a ridiculous who comes in and who stays in line process.

I had called and added myself and three friends to the guest list. We arrived after 11 pm and two of my friends had to go back to the apartment to get something. The security man (tall blonde guy with coat and side swept hair), told me that we had to either go in or get out of the line. We decided to go in and wait for our friends inside. To pie surprise, my two friends were being held outside and told they couldn't come in. His pathetic excuse was that after 11 pm no more people were allowed in. We had all arrived after 11! Once I told the security man this he started to say he didn't make the rules and that he just followed them. 

It was obvious that the problem was my friend's pagh. In a city like Vancouver, where there is a massive Punjabi population, this is not only unacceptable but ridiculous. He kept on denying it was for any other reason but the time. Mind you , he was letting other people in the line go in. He then told me that if I wanted my refund I had to go inside and get it. I went in and demanded my refund and the lady at the register looked bewildered. She said they didn't do refunds and that she needed the guy to tell her first that he had made such a comment in order to honor it.

Once I told the security guy he said that he had never mentioned anything about a refund! People in the line were shocked since they too had heard him say it. After a lot of struggle,they gave us back our 18 dollar entree fee back. YES $18 DOLLARS! Who do you think you are? This wasn't Vegas. I've gone to much nicer and upscale places that don't charge this exuberant amount of money for an entry fee. 

This place was the biggest joke. It left us a bad impression of Vancouver. Everyone in the staff was on a different note. No one agreed on what the actual rules were. I regret spending $12 on that one watered down vodka drink. 

DONT GO HERE. Spend your money somewhere else where they will treat you and your group with common courtesy.",2016-06-02T06:51:56Z,45
8,Twelvewest,1.9,"Does anybody know what's going on?

Went here for the first time for a paid private event which was arranged to end late in the AM. However the party was cut short when they stopped serving the event's open bar at 10:15 PM - to then charge an arm and leg for drinks when we bought 2 jager bombs totalling $19.50. 

DJ then proceeded to halt the music around 10:30 PM, as bouncers and staff rudely scrammed people to leave with no access to bathrooms. The event goers were all confused. Instead of taking the time to explain what was happening, bouncers threatened patrons. Oh - but yes, ""you can come back inside, just wait in line and pay another entrance fee"". 

Talk about hospitality. 

If you've ever wondered what it feels like to be livestock being herded out of a clammy farm, twelvewest's nightly events can certainly arrange that for you. Just don't expect to know when it will happen.",2018-04-29T05:07:04Z,45
9,Twelvewest,1.9,"CREDIT CARD SCAM.

I paid with my credit card; bartender told me that my card didn't go through. Told me to pay in cash instead. Checked my credit statement, my card did go through.

SCAM.",2017-02-27T17:42:37Z,45
10,Twelvewest,1.9,"I came here on a Friday night.  It's where the old Ginger 62 is.  They had free champagne for all the ladies the entire night.  They played mostly hip hop from about 2000-2005 the entire night.  Not sure what I can say about the renovations, but it does look like a brighter version of Ginger 62.   There were lots of people and I'm gonna have to head back to give a better review.",2015-03-24T10:57:53Z,45
11,Twelvewest,1.9,"I don't club much, but this place was over capacity and the drinks were definitely watered down and at 12$ a highball I'm not impressed. The Dj wasn't great some bad transitions and quiet moments which is weird for a Saturday night. It looks nice in there with the update, classy decor. Very mixed crowd here, definitely an older crowd night club. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't that good either ;)",2016-09-06T17:43:16Z,45
12,Twelvewest,1.9,"This club is a real disaster. Yesterday I went to this bar, and in less than an hour, I had my cell phone stolen from inside my bag. I felt it when someone put his hand inside my bag and took out the phone. The bar staff did not help me at all, and the hostess tells me it's quite common for that to happen. None of the local security guards were willing to help me, and yet one of them wanted to keep me from talking to the police.
I never go to this place again, and I'm not surprised by what happened, but by the employees' disregard for a customer who had their cell phone with their documents stolen. They have a security camera, and they could have helped me find the person who stole just watching the videos.",2017-09-17T22:29:57Z,45
13,Twelvewest,1.9,Got here with friends from a birthday. We were all on the guest list. They let my ftiends and only my friends in. We were early and wanted to celebrate at a club but they put us on the side when the to guest list line was empty and used us as pawns to draw crowds. We all eventually had to pay a discounted price to be let in,2018-11-24T06:51:49Z,45
14,Twelvewest,1.9,The staff was really great but the music wasn't very good to dance too and even at 11:00- 11:30 it was pretty empty and the people there weren't dancing... left pretty quick,2018-07-08T05:48:56Z,45
15,Twelvewest,1.9,Amazing club.  The girls here are the hottest in the city.  Bathroom guy really nice.  The doorman at the front named Peter even got my coat for me at the end of the night.  The drinks were pricey but it's Vancouver what are you gonna do,2018-10-13T04:03:13Z,45
16,Twelvewest,1.9,"I'm giving this place only 2 stars because i had my phone literally stolen from my purse while i was on the dance floor.  Mind you i was also completely sober with my girlfriends so this was a targeted event.  I know it is not completely the clubs fault, but I just want to warn others to be careful with their belongings because of what happened to me.  There should be better security personel and video cameras all around the club watching suspicious activity.  This will at least deter those types of criminals...hopefully.

I did speak with the VIP manager the following day and she told me to text her the info about my phone and will keep it on record in case it does show up; which i highly doubt it will. 
But at least she made some effort.",2015-08-16T02:10:48Z,45
17,Twelvewest,1.9,"The bouncer at twelvewest treated us in an extremely unprofessional and rude manner. He believed that my friends enhanced drivers license was a fake ID, because she was born a year younger and had an updated version of the Washington State license than the rest of the group. The bouncer didn't even bother to double check with any of his other employees, and tried to avoid us when we presented a second form of identification. He made no eye contact while dealing with us, overall the worst bouncer I have ever encountered.",2019-03-30T08:08:56Z,45
18,Twelvewest,1.9,"This place sucks.

Staff is rude, drinks are overpriced and the clientele is low end.

A girl I know was drugged there and spent the night in the ER. This isn't even the same girl that was in the news.

Stay away from this place.",2018-04-26T10:49:34Z,45
19,Twelvewest,1.9,Came here a few days ago and music wasn't that good as well as slow bar service. Jagerbombs were 11$ but that could've easily been overlooked if service was up to par,2018-07-10T23:27:45Z,45
20,Twelvewest,1.9,"Terrible experience just trying to get in. Apparently they had two lines which was so stupid and we were in the table line and had to go line up again in the other line up. We wait a bit then told everyone needs tickets, at that point we left. 

Probably will never go again and it's overrated.",2017-11-18T19:32:08Z,45
21,Twelvewest,1.9,"Twelvewest is the biggest money grab in the city. Went there for a birthday and paid $20 to get stamps. You would think that means you're in the club. Nope. We stepped outside for a bit and upon return, we were no longer allowed back in the club as it was over capacity. We stood in a re entry line for one hour and still didn't get back in. What kind of horrible service is that. They shouldn't even let it get to the point where it is over capacity as it is unfair to the people that have paid to be there. Twelvewest is essentially a scam so don't even bother wasting your time here.",2018-10-27T17:04:03Z,45

23,Twelvewest,1.9,I came here Memorial day weekend for my birthday. I like this club a lot. The bouncer and waitresses were all really good to me and my friends. They really took care of us. I like the music that was playing that night. The venue looks nice and to get bottle service the price were reasonable. I really have no complaints.,2015-07-29T06:15:03Z,45
24,Twelvewest,1.9,"Watered down liquor for sure. If you get Bottle Service make sure you watch them open the bottle in front of you. My Tequila shots had water in it for sure, But this might be normal for Vancouver no matter where you drink unless you're at your own house.",2016-05-14T04:52:11Z,45

26,Twelvewest,1.9,"This venue has been around for a while replacing Ginger 62.  The biggest changes to the venue are the increased number of tables for table service and music.
GOOD: 
Not too thuggish...  yet...
Good mix of guys and girls most nights I've gone.
Well dressed good looking crowd.

BAD:
Needs to investigate in better ventilation, or it will get VERY hot in the summer
High end cover.  Almost anywhere except near the bars it was very hot.
More tables means less mingling, more demand for bringing in more and more $$.
It makes me miss Ginger, but I understand that things change.",2015-06-09T05:31:41Z,45
27,Twelvewest,1.9,"Slightly disappointed with this club. Visiting from Seattle, I had a lot of expectations coming here. From all the fancy pictures posted online , I expected this club to be high end and pumped, which it was..Didn't mind standing in line but it was the rude bouncers/securities that we're kind of annoying . Kudos to the lady/host who helped us get checked in for the guest list . She was super nice, very accommodating and gave us the  red VIP guest list pass. Went through security inside  and was told to go to the left side since we had the vip slip. Another lady host was checking us and was about to stamped our wrists when one of the bouncers came and interrupted and said "" ur not supposed to be in this line. Go to the right side and get in line . "" I showed the bouncer our red slips and said "" that security guy over there told us to go through here so Idk why ur telling us to get in line on the right side"". He looked at us and just said "" oh okay. It's cool"" . Lady host apologized to us and proceeded with stamping our wrist. This club was packed and was super full. Good crowd but the dj played older songs which was kinda disappointing . Club was clean and bartenders were nice and polite. Does anybody know if this club plays better songs on a Saturday night ? We went on a Friday night maybe that had something to do with it .",2018-11-04T22:52:59Z,45
28,Twelvewest,1.9,This place was so inconsiderate of UBC's party as everyone was kicked out at 10:30pm to make room for a celebrity's after party. So our party was cut short with absolutely no notice and the bouncers were terribly rude as they were pushing us out.,2018-04-28T22:08:13Z,45
29,Twelvewest,1.9,Wish I could give this place 0 stars. Was on the guest list yet still had to wait in the regular line for some reason.Yet one of the bouncers was allowing select people of their choice to enter a private line allowing them to get in right away.Twelve west should really consider hiring some new staff.,2018-09-16T18:59:11Z,45
30,Twelvewest,1.9,This is the worse club I've been to in my life!! And I'm from Los Angeles ... Ladies night free ? Not free I payed $18 .. Free complimentary champagne ??? I didn't get any... So I bought myself 2 glasses & I got 2 shots of don Julio for $35 just because they only had 3 options of tequila so the selection was not good.. They make a huge deal on their Instagram of how amazing the club is but its not all! It's ghetto. I'll keep my clubbing in la or some other city in Vancouver plus I'm not a fan of seeing guys in ugly shorts with sandals no thanks!,2015-05-30T22:31:41Z,45
31,Twelvewest,1.9,"The anniversary party started super fun. Except for the anally retentive little, wrist stamp / security boy inside the front door. So officious and major attitude. Turned into a bouncer / freak when I tried to access the coatcheck to leave: Suddenly some dirty dude butted in front of me to chat up the nice coat check girl. When I stood my ground the security guy tried to humiliate me and pick a fight. Then for no reason he physically pushed me out the front door. Holy shit! 5 minutes later my coat was thrown out the door after me. When I spoke with the female management the next day she was shocked, but admitted they have had problems with this employee previously. Witnesses advised me to pursue this legally. Management: Get rid this jerk, please.",2018-03-02T07:53:20Z,45
32,Twelvewest,1.9,"They get 2 stars because cover was free and coat check was a decent $3 per coat. Staff is super nice as far as I can see so far, but the dj and the music playing on a SATURDAY NIGHT is sobering me up faster than the drink ticket lines at the lame hotel party I was at last month. Crowd = meh. I'd hit up another joint if you're looking to have a good time on a weekend.",2015-11-15T07:22:07Z,45
33,Twelvewest,1.9,"Worst club in Vancouver. There are so many other better clubs to spend your time at. The bouncers / hostess / security are rude and have horrible service. More importantly the owner is rude and has no customer service skills. Being from US and Toronto this club is a -1 out of 5 stars. Please take your business to a club that is worth it, this club is by far the worst club in Vancouver.",2015-06-20T10:58:33Z,45
34,Twelvewest,1.9,Service was extremely poor and they are very disrespectful  when I complained Owner Peter who was so douchey and talking about how he's slept with all of his (servers).

35,Twelvewest,1.9,"It was my birthday on May 18th, so I chose to celebrate at twelvewest with my friends. I had e-mailed Ian and asked about a guestlist. He said that we are good to go, and I was really excited to just dance the night away. Well. Saturday came and me and my friends ran like crazy from the skytrain to make it in time for the guestlist. We were literally 2 minutes late. The guy at the door said ""i can let you and one friend in, but the rest will have to wait in line"". Are you kidding me? Not only that but cover was $18? Like okay if we were actually so late I get it. But we were 2 minutes late, AND it was my birthday so I feel like they should have just cut us some slack. This ruined my birthday because I was seriously excited to go here. I've never been and now that I've seen how uncaring the staff was, I definitely will not be back. The girls with the tablets at the front door were so rude, that's why I usually don't go to places like that because I cannot stand snobby people, but I've seen a lineup in front of the place a few times so I thought it would be perfect for my birthday, a new club that I've never been to before. Turns out the place was a disappointment.",2019-05-20T19:26:14Z,45
36,Twelvewest,1.9,"hopped to this club after ditching venue, wasn't disappointed at all. The scene reminded me of an actual club experience- everyone was in their 20s & 30s. great music, and the exterior & interior of the club were beautiful. great layout too! bartenders were fun. drinks are pretty pricy though, and the lines were a bit confusing- they really need more signs or people directing you where to go.",2015-11-23T09:25:24Z,45

We immediately noticed the woman we paid had not given out IDs back. We asked her and she said she gave them back. So I walked over to another lady and she came over and as soon as that happened she gave the IDs back and said ""your friend doesn't need to call over 15 people.""

42,Twelvewest,1.9,"We had booked a table for fifteen people at Pierre's and ordered a couple bottles to start to celebrate a girlfriend's birthday.  The lights went out, so they shuttled everyone to Twelve West.  (Not our complaint.) Only half our group had arrived before the lights went out, so when the other half arrived at Twelve West, they wouldn't let us up to the table, including the birthday girl.  We tried to explain that we had booked at Pierre's and they had brought us over, but there was zero consideration given.  If you can't accommodate the original group, then let us know, cancel our reservation and let us head somewhere we can enjoy the night together.  What ensued was then a 45 minute debacle where they tried to force us to buy a third bottle to get everyone up there, only to be told that we wouldn't be able to get everyone to our table anyways.  One of the managers even called a girl in our group a bitch.  Absolutely appalling ploy.  Finally the guy at the ropes let the few women in, and refused to let in the men in our party, forcing them to go home.  The table next to us had twice the number of people and was spilling into our table.",2017-04-01T21:25:58Z,45
43,Twelvewest,1.9,"Really great club, my sister set up VIP for me and Ian was handling our process of planning and he was really great to work with, super understanding when things were getting changed like the number of people coming etc. When we got there we came like 10 minuets after 11 and they didn't even complain they just checked our ID's and waved us in. Right away Ian introduced himself and from there on we were very well handled. The waitresses were so nice and helpful and were always filling our cups and making sure we had everything. There was one man I didn't get his name that was always making sure we had clean cups and a lot of cups and the cups were not dirty which things like that definitely do not go unnoticed in my eyes. We went on Saturday May 19th and we sat right next the entrance just so the club maybe knows who served us at that table because they did an awesome job. The reason I took a star off was because of the washrooms, they were super dirty toward the end of the night which I understand drunk people make a lot of mess but the floor was super wet which is dangerous and just gross so even a quick mop up would have been better than nothing. The lady handing out paper towels was kinda rude she didn't really hand out towels unless you asked which was weird and just kinda looked judgy towards the girls in the washroom which I didn't like. Other than that the service was awesome the bartender was super nice and I would definitely recommend this club to anyone wanting to get VIP definitely worth the money and I would recommend to go even if you don't choose VIP.",2018-05-22T19:53:53Z,45
44,Guilt & Company,4.0,"We were in town just over night and our concierge told us about this spot for good live music and it did not disappoint. 

The staff was phenomenal and on top of it all night! They kept glasses and water readily available, drinks were kept full and they pushed food and drinks out all night quick and seamlessly. Our bar tender was Yalara (sp), it was super loud so I hope I got this right but she was a gem!! Give her a raise!!

It's pretty dark inside, and it was very warm. We sat at the bar and had a great view of the band and honestly the best people watching seats in the house. Highly recommend. We would def come back when in town.",2024-03-12T01:14:40Z,297
45,Guilt & Company,4.0,"We came on Saturday night as a party of 4 at 7:00 on the dot! We got to listen to some wonderful live music and catch up in a relaxed and lively environment. It was busy, but not so loud that we had to scream at one another over the music and conversation. 

We loved the garlic bread-can every bar do this? It was so nice to have something so simple and filling while we enjoyed our cocktails.

Looking at their menu, we loved that their cocktail names were creative and features quotes from famous songs.

I enjoyed a ""Como La Flor""-a tequila, guava and tajin combination. If you like all three of these things, you will love this cocktail. For a cocktail that has aperol, this was bitter without being too much. 

The best cocktail of the table was the ""one hot minute"". This cocktail is one of the most unique cocktails I have ever had the pleasure of having. This cocktail, from start to finish, was hot, sweet and delectable.

The last cocktail we shared was a #1 crush-this was simple and citrusy, and delightful. I could have had many of these.

This bar rocks! Their drinks and music are awesome-we can't wait to return.",2024-01-01T03:28:25Z,297
46,Guilt & Company,4.0,"Come here for the music! We came by on a Sunday night and got in to hear a great local jazz/funk fusion band. It was definitely loud but we got a seat by stage and it was loved the just $6 charge per set. Stay as long as you want! 

But the drinks are a mixed bag. The wine should be a pass. The beer scene is better and the prices are reasonable.  Service was quick and friendly. 

Definitely a place whether you're old or young to enjoy some music!",2023-11-14T01:45:43Z,297

48,Guilt & Company,4.0,"Enjoyed @guiltandco's patio during the off chance that we're getting some October sunshine . I stumbled into their basement by chance which instantly gave off completely different vibes. Almost speakeasy-esque with the dark, intimate candle-lit space, stone walls & low ceilings. I later found out they often host local musicians and bands here too!

They have a variety of cocktails, beers, and wine, as well as snacking food. I tried the following:

1 Coconut Jalepeño Ceviche $17 - Mahi-mahi, coconut milk, lime, cilantro, cancha, wasabi peas, corn tostadas
2 Raclette Potatoes $12 - Baby potatoes smothered in melted raclette cheese and herbs
3 Garlic Bread w Mozza $11 - Fresh focaccia with garlic butter, grilled",2023-10-07T03:38:01Z,297
49,Guilt & Company,4.0,"It was likely one of their less busy times, but I went there late on Thursday night nevertheless. in the midst of below-average temperatures and precipitation. However, I can understand how this spot may potentially exude a lively atmosphere on a weekend night. It was a blast having fun around with my server. I only gave it three stars since it was a quiet night and I had a few cocktails, which were great, but that was about it. Overall, it wasn't too bad.  So that we may have a greater perspective, I'll give you the return.",2023-12-05T20:06:02Z,297
50,Guilt & Company,4.0,"I was looking for a place to get a drink on Labor Day which was difficult to find, but Guilt & Co. was open. Glad they were. They had live music playing inside with zylophones and saxaphones. Totally hipster and I was about it!

Drink menu was a little limited, but my rum cocktail was good. Food looked pretty decent too. Lots of birthday parties and groups enjoying the night. It was a good place to lounge for a few hours. 

Prices were fair. I'd recommend it.",2023-09-07T21:35:07Z,297
51,Guilt & Company,4.0,"I was here for my wife's BD. A NICE music bar that you can wish to find in downtown Vancouver with great staff And great music. This great band (@Ty.Koch) made our night very special  but the joy didn't stop there, the food was great,,,,small portions, reasonable price, incredibly delicious, and great presentation,,,,so I asked to see the chef to thank him in person. And sure enough my wife and I had a pleasure to meet with Chef Paco (see him in the picture- first from left), such a creative and talented chef....I would give him 10 out of 10......ps. I'm not in restaurant business but if one day I open a restaurant I'll invite you to become my head chief Go Chef Paco. 
I don't know if or when I may come back  to Vancouver again, but every time I travel here, I definitely come to this place again.",2023-11-12T01:59:05Z,297
52,Guilt & Company,4.0,"Guilt & Co is an amazing live music venue with a little dance floor up front and tasty treats to enjoy. 

Highly recommend bringing ear plugs cause it can get kinda loud. Also cover was $6/set/person. And that night, there were two sets after 10pm. 

We put it our order for a cheese board and it looked like the kitchen forgot our order, but no, they just were really busy. But at the end of the night, they gave us a discount on the bill, which was fantastic. Thanks for trying to make things right! 

I dont drink so not much to report on that end. 

All in all the vibe was amazing, the cheese board was honestly so delish, I had great company, and of course the live band was fantastic. Highly recommend overall.",2023-04-07T20:58:20Z,297

56,Guilt & Company,4.0,"If Gastown had gone through prohibition, Guilt & Co. would have been its speakeasy. 

Perfect for a rainy Vancouver evening, duck down the stairs and into an underground room with brick and stone walls, servers in 30's-era clothing, and live music or improv comedy. The 30's-era stuff works because they never try too hard...this isn't ""Medieval Times"" set in gangster-land, but a nod to an era and a way of drinking. 

Indeed, Guilt & Co. is a place for drinking rather than eating, with six beers on tap all priced at $6/pint, another eccentric list of at least 30 in bottles, and a thoughtful - if slightly try-hard - cocktail menu at about $8-11 per drink.  I can't comment on the wine list except to say there were about ten reds and ten whites, at about $9-10 a glass.

The food is all appies and reminds me of Six Acres across the street. We tried the olives, beef tartar, meat and cheese platter, which were all of above-average quality with no surprises; the potato chips, which were delicious and fun, and went well with beer; the brulee, which that evening was coconut and very smooth; and truffles, which were nothing unexpected...but whats not to love about truffles? 

I get the impression that the people behind this place really wanted it to have a personable feel - the staff was warmer than most in Gastown, and were sure to let us know that we could buy jars of their antipasto or pickles for only $5 each. If I lived closer, I could see myself becoming a regular here.",2010-06-18T21:05:09Z,297

When we arrived 10 past 7 we were told they weren't ready yet and to come back in 5 minutes... when clearly there hours stated they opened at 7pm. So we went to a nearby spot to grab a bite and came back about an hour later. We found a spot to sit at near the stage. At this point the place was packed and the line up at the door was getting bigger and bigger. The server approached us very rudely and said ""these seats are reserved"" when there was no sign on it?.. so we said we didn't know and got up and got a seat by the DJ booth. The server NEVER came back to ask us what we wanted to drink not once in the hour and a half we were there! So my friend had to go to the bar to get us drinks! Such HORRIBLE service!!!!!!!! THE only reason I'd come back here would be for the live music which is nice . I felt bad my friend had to experience this as it was her first time there!",2018-09-30T16:26:12Z,297

64,Guilt & Company,4.0,"I had no clue that I have been to this place in the past. I came here with some colleagues to enjoy the night. Guilt & Co. is located in the basement. I was surprised how the inside hasn't changed much. When I arrived at 8 pm, there was a short line at the door. The wait was probably 5 mins which wasn't bad. 

They have 5 sets of music and each set cost $6 (per person) that will be automatically get charged to the bill. Each set runs for 45 mins and each night there are 5 sets. In between the sets there is about 30 to 45 mins intermission for the next band to set up. The main band is the later set or the last set of the night. The place is very loud and very packed. So if you want to have a good conversation with someone this is not the best place to be. If you care coming here for the later show, do show up early. The line will be up the stairs and that is how popular that main show will be. 

I came here for food as well. I got the duck confit sandwich $23. It was a very good size and I have to say it was absolutely amazingly delicious. I got a side with it which was another $3. I chose the potatoes. Definitely a bad choice. The potatoes were very mediocre and not worth the price. 

Service was ok. You do have to flag someone down if you need something. They do come by but not that often. I do like the music and the vibe. Maybe I am getting old but I have noticed the people coming here are younger folks. I had a fun night.",2022-12-17T17:04:59Z,297
65,Guilt & Company,4.0,"You walk down a flight of stairs into a dimly lit room packed with people enjoying good music, drinks, food, and company.  Great atmosphere, pretty much everyone appeared tto be enjoying themselves.   Can't ask for much more.  

It is a music venue with a good selection of beers, cocktails, wines, and hard cider.  Non-alcoholic choices too.  

Service was pretty much as you would expect.  The place was packed, be prepared to wait for food, beverages came fairly quickly and additional rounds were easily ordered.

There is a decent selection of vegetarian items with a few vegan items as well.  We had dinner before arriving so we only enjoyed our beers while listening, with one exception.  The soup of the day was a Borscht which one of us ordered.  I took a taste and frankly did not enjoy it, as much because it is served cold as the tasted itself.  I give them a lot of credit for putting it on the menu which does not limit itself to just traditional bar food.

While not quiet, the music was not overly loud and if you wanted to talk it was possible. They charge a cover charge per set; for us the band we wanted to see played 2 45 minute sets with a fairly short break between.

If we are ever in Vancouver again will definitely return.",2023-07-10T21:50:11Z,297
66,Guilt & Company,4.0,"Ended up here during a trip to Vancouver and fell in love with the place. So much so, that we came here multiple times within our short stay. 

I'm not sure how their food is, as we came for live music, drinks, and vibes - all of which they certainly delivered well. The ambiance is dimly lit and romantic, like something you'd see in a movie where the protagonist makes eye contact with someone from across the room while a jazz band plays out seductive tunes in the background. The drinks are good, not mind blowing, but tasty enough to invoke curiosity in exploring what else they can concoct after finishing your first glass. The music performers that played during my multiple visits were all extremely talented and were my biggest draw to this place.

I'd love to pay this place a visit again, should I ever return to Vancouver. It gets a 9/10 from me.",2023-08-14T20:53:30Z,297

71,Guilt & Company,4.0,"Below is the review I wrote our first night at Guilt & Co.  We went back after dinner at St. Lawrence on Sunday night to listen to an amalgam band named Nightwalker.  There was no line, and we were escorted immediately to a table for two after being advised about a cover charge of $6.00 per person.  Six bucks! That's nothing for listening to great musicians.  Our server was an attractive, petite woman with dark hair, who works her ass off and seems to be at Guilt every night.  She runs around taking care of every patron.  The music by Nightingale was amazing, but again, a bunch of people got up to dance blocking the sight lines for everyone else.  The music was concert quality, and I didn't think Guilt was a club.  I thought it was a concert venue.  Despite the dancers, listening to the musicians was cool, until the two dudes in front of us began arguing with the server about the $6.00 cover charge.  Are you kidding me!  They were giving this poor woman a hard time, and I had to intervene.  I offered to pay the 12 dollars, which is about $9.00 for me.  The server refused, wanting the two nincompoops to pay.  By that time, the band's set was done, and it was time to head back to the Loden Hotel.  Guilt & Co. has great music, and the concept is egalitarian, but dancing should be restricted to an area that doesn't block the sight lines for the patrons who choose not to dance.  Also, if people refuse to pay the $6.00 cover charge, let them serve drinks and food for 30 minutes, and they'll be happy to fork over the 6 bucks.  Maybe they'll appreciate how hard people work, and what the $6.00 is for.  
-----------------------
I like the concept, and the people who work here are very kind.  As a venue, the acoustics could be better, but food, liquor and the bands are all good.  However, I am now old.  I don't feel old, and I don't act old, but age tapped me on the shoulder when I wasn't looking.  There was a band we wanted to hear on Friday night.  We stood on line over 45 minutes, and my body was in pain, and my wife was looking at me with her death stare.  After 50 minutes, we ditched and went to L'Abattoir for drinks.  

Saturday night we went back and we were able to wait on the patio.  That was infinitely better, but the band lacked energy for some reason, and some bad dancers detracted from listening to the band. We will try to get into Guilt & Co. tonight, before or after our dinner at St. Lawrence.  It's all a crap shoot, but for me, I can wait in a line maybe 15 minutes.  That's why Guilt & Co gets four rather than five stars.",2022-06-27T01:09:04Z,297
72,Guilt & Company,4.0,Amazing summer patio. Food is 5 star! Best fish tacos I've had in town. The seasonal salad is to die for. I don't understand how people go to the restaurant next door and not this. The food is honestly superb. If I could do 10 stars I would.,2023-07-30T17:44:07Z,297

I have been coming consistently for some time. I show up early to get a table. I am the first to sit and (sans pandemic) am the first to stand up and dance. But often. I am among the last to leave. The sounds of the bands who play for me tickle my ear drums as they beat their own. 

I spent 3 years in Russia. This bar reminds me of home. My home. I was born in Coquitlam and this reminds me of that. That is why I come here so often to spend time with friends, family, tunes, and cocktails, popcorn. This place gladdens me.",2021-10-01T05:01:06Z,297

Hands down the best cocktail on the menu (especially for gin lovers) is ""grounds for divorce."" It's refreshing and citrusy (lemon), not overly sweet, and very easy to drink.

80,Guilt & Company,4.0,"I didn't even know this place existed and I'm so happy my friend brought me here! It's a secret little stairwell that goes underground to a cozy type lounge. I absolutely loved the atmosphere - dim lights, rock walls, greenery, and every table lit up by candle light.

The environment of people were really interesting as well. The ages varied substantially, some were dressed up formal and on a date, others were with a big group of friends, and other simply just came for a drink! 

I really enjoyed the drink menu. They had very creative cocktails that weren't insanely priced (like the Diamond). They also had a really good bite sized snacks and appetizers. My friend and I got the medium size cheeseboard. We originally wanted to get the large size but the server said it would be do big and thought we we couldn't do it. FYI, we could totally do it. It didn't actually come with much cheese, but the crackers, bread, meat, olives, beats, and jams/mustard were awesome. I would definitely order it again. The large though ...

We got there around eight, and around 10 a live band started to play. Again it was just a really fun and chill atmosphere where everyone appeared very friendly and just wanting to have a good time. I am definitely excited to come back. FYI I would get there somewhat early because once it got full the line went around the block and didn't budge for at least a few hours.

Cons : cover cost is $6 per set not the night not the band . If they take a break and come back you pay again . That would be fine if I was told at the door. 
I had 2 glasses of wine and entre and ate my desert during the break , I asked for the bill 10 minutes after the second set started and had to pay and extra $6 and on top of that were taxes . 
I talked to the bartender and he was offended and kinda rude . That ruined the experience unfortunately.

84,Guilt & Company,4.0,"What happened to guilt and co?

The space is great. Ambiance, music, warm. 

The food was terrible!!  

First we order olives. A little starter to have with drink. They arrive with HALF a loaf of bread, toasted , huge, hard...no knife, no fork, no napkin. The server places and leaves. 

Next I see a server and I ask for a knife to cut the bread. Half a loaf mind you. Nothing I could pick up and eat without looking like a beast.  I person quickly walking but throws two napkins disheveled, with a knife buried in there. A butter knife to cut this giant toasted loaf. 

""Assorted olives, artichokes, and capers marinated in honey, ginger, garlic, & herbs"". Is what I ordered. 

I got olives and artichokes in a heap if  
Sooooo spicy, so greasy no taste of olive. No fork but a little stick for poking and olive. Except is was covered in all this gunk. And this giant half a loaf of bread. 

The bread is not in its own basket but on top of the olives. Anyway. Inedible. Whoever wrote the menu and whoever is cooking the food are NOT on the same page. 

I'm expecting a bowl of olives, which I've had elsewhere, nice, identifiable olives. Warm. 

So I tell our server that I cannot eat these. They are so incredibly Spicy and I do not need half a loaf of bread. 

Then I order  

""Greens, seasonal vegetables, fruits and shredded manchego. Served with toasted bread.
Seasonal Salad""

Sounds lovely. 

I get a large bowl of greens that appear to have been diced   It's very very dense due to the small size of greens. Like porridge. It's heavily coated in dresssing. Heavy like milk in oatmeal. There are no veggies or fruit and the only thing I shredded is the lettuce. It was also served with a giant half loaf of bread. It was stunning that they would even serve such a thing. 

I told the server that could not eat this either and I pointed out the discrepancies between the menu and what I actually received. 

She comes back and says I have to pay for the salad because they comped the olives. I disagreed of course because they did to deliver what they promised. 

So the manager comes over. He walks up behind me and starts talking very loud before I can even see his face. He s looming over me basically having a tantrum. 

He's yelling about how I'm causing the restaurant to lose money with my rejection of its food. He stamps his foot and says I have to pay. I just turn forward in my chair and say nothing. I was having to turn on my seat to look at him because refused to address me from the front. Wow! 

Then he says fine but just the one time. Whoa. Does he think I'm coming to eat there ever again?  . 

I did notice that no one was eating. Which is funny cause precovid that place was great. Great food. Always busy preshow for people who wanted to eat. The had charcuterie boards in three sizes so a small on was perfect for one. 

So guilt and company. No one is coming there to eat because your physical representation of the menu is WAY OFF!  

New management. No one wants half a loaf of bread  the want tastefully marinated warmed olive. And the salad....no words. The behaviour of your on floor manager was like a child having a loud tantrum in a public place. Embarrassing and totally uncalled for. Alienating, bad form, make restaurant look bad speaking to a customer like that. 
BTW. I was polite, quiet and respectful as I always am. 

Atrocious behaviour. The salad... nothing like what the menu says. OMG does management know this type of food is being served.",2022-05-20T17:22:32Z,297

Their speciality cocktails were excellent. The staff waiting on us had recommended 'Grounds for Divorce'. When I say the drink was excellent - that would be an understatement.

The vibe was very enjoyable. 

The place was definitely crowded - but not necessarily in a bad way. However this meant that the staff waiting on us could not check up on us as often as I would have preferred. But whenever we called on them they promptly came and helped us out. Once the order was placed, the drinks arrived fairly quickly and as mentioned earlier they were spectacular.

However, had a glass of Cava which tasted flat and a Rose which was like a chilled red with a hint of vinegar - not good.  Pork tacos and salmon tacos were filling but the tortillas were gritty. Would not order again.  All in all, I think beer/cocktails/popcorn might be the way to go and would eat elsewhere.  We arrived really early at 6 on a Friday. We could sit wherever we wanted. At 7 it was pretty much full and when we left at 8ish a line up was starting.  FYI the one large washroom with several stalls is unisex causing some confusion.",2022-10-30T18:09:34Z,297

I had a particular dietary request; the chef prepared something off menu just for me, how impressive! Later, the chef came to my table so I could thank her personally. My date had the spaghetti which was the best she has ever had. The only negative was the limited wine selection. This did not deter from the overall experience. We finished the meal with a chocolate tart, a very good recommendation from our waitress. 

I have to mention how amazing the staff was. I go to a lot of restaurants, I know good service. This place gets full marks. The staff was professional, courteous and friendly.

We have brought our friends here whenever they visit Vancouver. However, beware that the drinks are quite pricy! As for the menu, there aren't that many options. So it's best that you eat elsewhere but come and just enjoy the music with some good IPA beer.",2021-10-20T02:58:10Z,297

96,Guilt & Company,4.0,"Wouldnt recommendend. My boyfriend and I used to love coming into this place before Covid for good drinks, live music and a great time. However the whole vibe has changed. For starters, a staff member pushed my mom aside to get through to the front door when an ""excuse me"" would've worked.  Then the hostess says ""its okay, he works here"". 

Our server took 13 minutes to greet us and when I asked for some clarification on the cover charge, he got REAL pissy. Rolled his eyes, and told us that if we didn't want to pay that we could just leave. I couldnt believe it ... We were just trying to understand the cover method ( $6 for every set you watch) I only asked him if we needed to pay for 2 sets as we had walked in on the last ten minutes of the first set. 

anyway, someone like that shouldnt be in cuwtomer service. I wouldnt come back.",2022-05-26T02:43:51Z,297
97,Guilt & Company,4.0,"Had a fun night out listening to live music. I arrived two hours early for a 10 pm show, best decision ever!  The place fills up early for live music. There was a long line to get in when I left at 11 pm. 

Seating is first come first served. 

It can get loud as guests try to talk over the recorded music playing while the band sets up equipment. 

If you arrive late you are part of the standing crowd which is off-putting for those seated behind at the tables. 

I ordered warm olives and deluxe nut mix. Pretzels with the nuts were a bit stale and the mix was heavy on peanuts which are my least favorite. 

Because the musicians do not sound check the sound balance is not the best during the first few songs. The sound technician gets it together and the music is good about mid set. 

I would go back. This is a great casual date spot. Not a dress up spot at all.",2019-03-31T19:01:06Z,297

We thoroughly enjoyed our evening there. You walk down and is located in the basement and might be a bit of a challenge to find it. There is no entrance fee, the guy at the door mentioned that the musicians/bands will be playing and the donations goes to them.

The place was rustic and hip and I enjoyed the live music. It was fun watching the musicians arrive and setting up the stage for performance. They have dancing area at the front, close to the stage.

The cocktails were tasty, delish and has unique names. Our waitress were super nice and attentive.

101,Guilt & Company,4.0,This place has decent priced beer on tap.   If I remember correctly it was $7 for a 16oz and $8 for a 20oz.  The ambience is very good for a live venue.   I would describe it as intimate.  Yet there is lots of seating for any of the live shows.   The sounds works throughout the venue.   I like how they support the band by donation with a recommended donation of $5-10.   Support your local bands!   This is one of the few venues that still plays local musicians.   The bands usually start around 9:30-10pm.   But they go until midnight or sometimes later.   Very good venue for live music.,2019-01-16T03:34:35Z,297
102,Guilt & Company,4.0,"Located beneath Chill Winston, this place is quite easy to miss if one doesn't notice the sandwich board outside.

Parking here is absolutely horrendous.  Look far away.

The lounge is literally a basement.  It's class, but not the largest space.  The dim lighting adds to the ambience.  Behind the stage area is a secret room that looks more like a former tunnel.  The theme seems to be classy but vintage.

Staff were friendly, but were a bit too spaced out.  We had trouble waving down the waitress.  Because all of the tables are round, it is best not to go in too large of a group (5 max), as the tables cannot simply be combined.

I had the Honourable Mention cocktail.  A neat little herbal concoction with chocolate mixed in.  I must say I'm a sucker for cocktails.  Too bad these things are also $10-15 for a half highball.  Definitely can't do this everyday.

There was a live band when I was there.  Unfortunately, when they started playing, it got so loud that nobody at my table could hear each other anymore, effectively cutting our night short.  They need to turn it down a notch or two.  Loud does not automatically mean great.  With that said, the musicians that night were somewhat decent.",2015-06-16T09:19:34Z,297

It's an intimate space witha small dance floor next to the stage. They limit the number of patrons inside, so it doesn't feel crowded. 
Stick with the beer, wine, or whiskey. Cocktails were watered down. They've got some delicious thick cut fries served with aioli. The brussel sprouts are also worth checking out.",2017-05-21T20:58:40Z,297

105,Guilt & Company,4.0,"Disclaimer: Don't come here looking for board games. They don't have any. Or at least our server seemed confused when we asked.. 

Board game confusion aside, Guilt & Company is kind of an awesome space. Some cousins and I came to have a few drinks. It's a little hard to find, but luckily we eventually found it underneath another establishment (Chill Winston).

There was a cover charge (I believe it was $10 CAD) but we came just in time for their live show. A rotating group of about 5 or 6 singers/groups took the stage in the dimly lit basement and thoroughly entertained us with their cover songs both old and new. (Someone even did India Arie - Video. I love that song!)

Their drinks were strong - very much reminded of speakeasy vibes with their concoctions. Very much a music theme to their cocktail menu - each drink name complete with appropriate song lyrics. I first order the Street Fighting Man (Summer's here and the time is right for fighting in the streets - Rage Against the Machine) and this was strong and delicious. I also ordered the Sittin' Sidewayz (yes, you guessed it... Paul Wall) and this was also strong and did it's job.

106,Guilt & Company,4.0,"Stopped in Guilt & Company while visiting from Seattle for a couple nights and I can see why it was full on a Sunday evening, with a lot of good reviews. 

There was live music going on, which is a nice change of pace. My group was only there for a short amount of time, but we got to enjoy Beast of Burden among a couple other songs. We were definitely the youngest group... mostly people in their 30s and 40s, which is fine. Some women were dancing up in front by the band. I'm always a fan of dancing so it was great to see people having a good time. Overall the vibe was relaxed... maybe not the best choice if you're planning on getting lit.

I tried one drink and it was pretty tasty too... my friend ordered it but I think it was a cosmo? Anyway it was fruity and sweet but not overly so. 

I would come back again to enjoy some live music and a couple tasty cocktails in the future.",2018-04-19T18:29:43Z,297

I play a bit of roulette with the cutest server. My buddies and I just told her we love old fashions and bring us whatever she thinks is best for us. Scary, yet exhilarating at the same time. To this day, I don't know what drink she brought.

110,Guilt & Company,4.0,"If you're looking for Guilt & Co by address only, it's a little hard to find this place. Your GPS/map will take you to the actual ""1 Alexander Street"" to the right of Winston, but it's just a doorway that tells you to go behind Winston. It's actually the basement of Winston, and the entrance is on the left side of the building. 

Our friend performed here on a Sunday night during the holidays. They don't have the best acoustics but hey, it's not a concert hall, and it was great to have live music at a bar! She had a chill, mellow sound, used a loop, and had a beautiful voice. She was opening for another artist that was something like poppy-jazzy-50s-swing-dancing music. I liked the contrast!

The service is kind of slow, but they seemed to be completely understaffed. It's a really large bar area and there were just a few bartenders making the drinks (for both the tables and the bar) and maybe a couple servers. 

We got there around 7:50pm that Sunday and it looked like it was going to be a relatively slow night with just a couple of tables with customers. We were able to sit right at the front to watch our friend perform. By the time she started at 8:30pm, it was much more packed and stayed that way well through midnight.

The drinks sound stellar when you read them off of the cocktail menu. But none of them overly impressed us.

* Rock Bottom Riser (Chili infused tequila, velvet falernum, crushed ice. Bodacious Merlot. $13) - 2.5 stars
This was definitely spicy, and that was the only part that impressed me. It was also a lot stronger than I expected, which to me drowned out any other subtle flavors there may have been. As a crushed ice drink, you also can't really milk this because it'll start melting and getting diluted really quickly. 

* Holy Smoke (Bulleit bourbon, Laphroaig Quarter Cask, black tea, lemon, agave, pepper. $13.25) - 2.5 stars
My boyfriend got this and wasn't too impressed by this one either. He's usually an old-fashioned-type drink lover.

* Belle (Cream of Earl Grey infused vodka, Chambord, vanilla, lavend3r, soda. $11.50) - 3 stars
This was a little better than the Holy Smoke or the Rock Bottom Riser, but it was a bit too sweet, and I usually like sweeter drinks!

The band didn't start until 9:45, and to be dismayed, as soon as the music started, a couple from the ""reserved"" table next to us started to dance in front of the space in between the stage and the seating area. This is not the first time we came to this bar and we have seen people dancing to the music before, but, to anybody's common sense, the music just started, people who come here paid to see the band, not to see a bunch drunk elephants dancing. However eager you are, couldn't you wait a damn 10 mins at least to let the audience enjoy a nice 10 min's music before you work on your elephant dance?

There were 3 of us so I decided to order 3 drinks, there were some miscommunication which resulted in me getting 3 drinks but paying for 2 and not knowing.

Anyways we ordered more drinks and after half an hour or more we decided to leave for a smoke.
The bartender came running at us in the street saying you paid for 2 but you got 3. I told him we will go back but he insisted he wants the money now and since I didn't have cash my friend paid him. I didn't want him to pay and I found the bartender a bit rude. 

So I went back and talked to Brandon who called himself the manager, He was the most rude manager I've ever seen. He told me that the bartender is not rude, in fact you are rude for leaving the table and not paying for the drink and you are drunk and I can feel your breath when I was just talking to him very gently.

We came here by chance without checking any reviews in advance. First impression was the place look very cozy. It's around 8pm so more than half of the place was empty but since there's a performance at 9.30 we noticed later the place quickly got filled.
The staffs here were extremely friendly and attentive, they came often to check on you even though it was extremely busy on that night ( Sunday before Xmas). We were not so impressed with their cocktails actually even though the name and the descriptions caught our eyes a lot, however the taste was not as expected/described.
We love their whiskey list A LOT. We tried like 10 different whikies there all good. Especially we loved how they choose for Canadian whiskies, all was so good, well presented for Canadian's. Because of this, we traveled back home with 3 bottles of Canadian whiskies 
The music they played on that day was early 2000s ( not current pop songs) which was really good. We had good drinks, good music for the night.

Came here on a regular night with a bunch of friends for cocktails and meeting-up since we haven't seen each other for the past four months. And we stayed for a good portion of the night~!!

Their red velvet cake though, is totally to die for, and the live music at the same time really makes the place the perfect lounge. Talk with friends, catch up and have delicious drinks at the same time? Yeah, this is the place!!",2015-06-18T21:34:44Z,297

Bathrooms are unisex. Don't freak out. Mingle for fucks sake when you washing your hands (seriously who doesn't wash their genital germ laced hands).

We had some poutine, small but god, but kind of pricey.  What struck me about the food menu here was that some of it seemed like the wrong place to order it. A $30+ swordfish meal? Not something I'm going to eat on a tiny bar table in this place (though I'm sure it was good).

We LOVED it. The band was fantastic, we loved the atmosphere, the servers and the other patrons. Everyone was really enjoying the music and decently priced drinks. No cover, which is nice when coming from a place that ALWAYS charges cover no matter what band is playing.

Tip #3! Do try the variety platter! It's all sorts of yummy - cheese, olives, tapinade, crackers, oysters and more finger-licking goodness.

I'm a fan of older buildings with character and was really into the strategically lit, stone and mortar walls, exposed pipes, designer heritage cellar vibe to this place. It reminded me a little of chic pubs and lounges I've visited in Europe, where ambiance always seems so effortless.

The food menu is appy-oriented so don't go hungry unless you count beer as food. The beer menu here is so extensive, it needs to be broken down by country.

So onto the bar I go. And ask for the cool cocktail menu. My eyes settle on the East of Eden... clean, refreshing and yum. Great bartender, cool guy. He said don't worry about the tip. That was nice.

I wander across the lovely brick-paved Gastown streets back to my hotel in the quiet, chilled evening.",2012-01-15T04:09:19Z,297
140,Guilt & Company,4.0,"Avoid this place like the plague. Aggressive host staff asking a million questions. You can't choose where to sit even if there are no reservations. If you're 40, expect to get ID'd. Finally when you get to sit somewhere you are not comfortable with sitting at in the first place, your server is rude and snappy. Tip 18% and he will roll his eyes.

Not out to mention names, but this dank hole is better off for college kids and people who really do not care about service, seating, atmosphere, quality or well... Anything... Pretty much a cave to get black out drunk in. We felt like at any minute there would be a bar brawl in this dump or a Surrey shoot out.

Go upstairs to Chill Winston, they will appreciate you a lot more.",2016-01-30T03:24:10Z,297
141,Guilt & Company,4.0,"What an incredibly cool space.  Ventured over there for the first time a few weeks ago at around 6pm and was pleasantly surprised.  

The cocktails were pretty good but not as good as some of the other Gastown haunts.  However,  the room was very interesting in a bohemian Gastown basement kind of way.  The cavern behind the stage where they play Jenga also looked like a lot of fun after a few cocktails.

The really cool concept that intrigued me was - they have auditions for musicians and pair them in 3-somes every Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights based on the music genre the staff want that night.  Apparently the talent is quite good.  I still haven't been back on one of the music nights but will soon.  They apparently have over 30 musicians on their list and each night is different.  Sometimes there are people from the audience that come onstage and jam with them.  Almost seems like a resurgence of the amazing Classical Joint of the 80's.  Wow that would be amazing if that happened.

Check it out.  They also have a variety of other games on their menu that looked fun.",2011-03-25T23:57:10Z,297
142,Guilt & Company,4.0,"After dinner at the Flying Pig, we went to the Revel @ our waitress' suggestion. Super cute club with Rockabilly Vibe. Although we were having fun there, we wanted to check out Guilt & Co. It's in the basement so we almost missed it. They had good acoustics too. I didn't catch the name of the band but they were jamming. They played reggae, r&b, & bluesy jazzy tunes.  They had everyone dancing and had the club asking for ""1 more song"" twice. We didn't want to let them go! 

They had the cutest names for their drinks. I got the ""I adore you"" which came with a wedge of cucumber which was really refreshing.  We also ordered beef jerky and it took forever! We thought they might be killing the cow and curing it in house : )  When it finally arrived, it was unlike any beef jerky I've ever seen. It was sliced in thin but long wide sheets. It tasted like it was cured in shoyu. It was good though, highly addictive. 

Loooved this band too! Nightlife in Vancouver is awesome!",2014-05-13T08:11:12Z,297
143,Guilt & Company,4.0,"First, let me pre-warn you, *bathrooms are co-ed*, so ladies, don't be alarmed as you're walking out of the stall and see a dude there. Guys, you are in the right bathroom. You may be tipsy, but not THAT tipsy.

You can get some great beers here. If I remember correctly, my blanche de chambly, a Quebec beer, was served in a huge glass with an orange slice. Just had their special on tap again last night and it was divine. Regardless, I love the variety. Even their non-alcoholic drinks are cute!

So, what's all the hype about Guilt & Co.? Well, if you haven't heard already, they have giant jenga! Okay, it's not life-size or anything, but is significantly larger than the original game. You definitely don't want to be standing near the jenga tower as it falls if you're wearing open-toed shoes! OUCH.


They have a variety of games, but sometimes you're left gameless because everyone else is playing them. It's also really loud in there. Taboo was a screaming contest. The place was really cool and hip (prepare to see lots o' hipsters). No cover, but long, long line ups. The place is always packed on Friday and Saturday nights.

145,Bar None Nightclub,2.5,"Always wondered what was inside here.  Didn't look like much other than a dark door and some bouncer-looking people inside.

Parking is available but scarce in this part of town, mainly because of the Yaletown location.  The good news is it's near a SkyTrain station.

The club mostly consists of a large central dance floor with the bar area along part of the outer perimeter.  I must say this is one of the nicest bar counters I have seen in a while.  It's not crammed full of liquor bottles, but the drinks look more like works of art.

There was a DJ the night we went, and the tunes were actually quite good.

Seating is a bit lacking as the dance floor takes up quite a large space.",2017-09-18T01:53:27Z,64

I have no words. I've traveled quite a bit and have lived in various cities across North America. I can't think of a venue that has been as unorganized and misleading as this ""bar/ club"". Let's start with the hyped up long line we waiting for over 30 minutes. Once inside It was empty (insulting) now let's add insult to injury while we are at It, cover charge (25 Canadian dollars) however, we got a ""discount pink card"" which was for 16 Canadian dollars, still insulting. Moving on, the over priced watered down cocktails and shots. I paid 38 Canadian dollars for two Patron shots (top shelf at this place), what! I can't remember the last time I paid that much for cheap tequila. Not in Paris, not in N.Y.C not in Casablanca and definitely not in Los Angeles. 

I had several conversations with women in the washroom and all agreed that this place is over hyped and not a good crowd. Service was unsatisfactory all across! As a world traveler I would absolutely not recommend this venue. It was beyond disappointing and overrated. If you are visiting the city (as a tourist) I strongly suggest a local bar or a restaurant that has some type of an ambiance.",2020-03-01T11:49:58Z,64

148,Bar None Nightclub,2.5,"Okay, I'm not a clubby person AT ALL.  I do not club, dance, dress up to go out, whatever.  But I will say my time at Bar None wasn't absolutely terrible as I expect all clubs to be.  We came here as part of my friend's bachelorette celebration and had connections, so were able to skip the line and jump ahead.  On a Friday night around 10 there was a good size line forming, but the place wasn't packed at all yet.  

Staff was fine, not friendly nor were they rude.  We walked in and I immediately loved the old school hip hop music playing.  Glad to know there are clubs that play hip hop v. EDM.  We had table service for our group, so had a lounge area reserved for us, with vodka shots and cranberry.  In the middle of the night one of the servers would come over, to clear glasses and would make sure vodka was filled in shot glasses and refill the ice bucket.  

For dancing it was fun the first hour and half we were there, as the old school hip hop jams continued to play.  But the music changed to more modern rap later on, which I don't care too much for.  At least there were fans everywhere, so that when we danced it didn't feel like we were sweating so much.  For someone who hates clubs - I didn't hate Bar None.  Overall, it was a fine place to dance and hang out with friends.",2017-06-24T19:45:27Z,64
149,Bar None Nightclub,2.5,"My buddy and I walked in here pretty early in the night, around 10PM. We paid the cover ($15CAN), and walked right on in. I asked the girl at the front desk for the wifi password, as I turned off my roaming data. Some dude who worked there quickly snapped, saying this was a club and that they don't give out the wifi password. I guess bad attitudes aren't exclusive to LA and Vegas clubs.
My buddy and I brushed that off, and proceeded to buying some beers. The bartender girl gave off a very bad attitude as well. Spotting her is easy: she is tall, blonde, and older looking that the rest of the bartenders. 
Naturally, we got a bad image of this place, but we decided to stay and see what the crowd was going to be like. There were several groups showing up and getting bottle service. There was eye candy here, and the club starting popping around midnight. We hung out until around 1:30AM, and decided to call it a night after that.
In spite of the first two people being disagreeable, the rest of the staff was actually friendly. The coat check girl was pretty cool, and we chatted a bit about travel adventures. The guy providing paper towels, cologne, and snacks in the men's restroom was also a chill dude. I tipped both those people well.
As for the guy who initially gave me attitude, I went up to him on two separate occasions to ask him some questions. He seemed to drop his attitude toward the end of the night. However, I do not tolerate that kind of stuff, so I'm docking three stars from this place.
I've worked customer service during my undergrad years, and I will be using customer service when I start my medical career. That kind of bad attitude will only be a provider's detriment.

Despite standing in line for about an hour AND paying a darn cover...the music that was blasting in here as we were waiting was makin' this booty twitch like crazy!!!

There was some kind of vodka promotional event the night we chose to hit up Bar None so walking in and taking a ""red carpet"" photo while being handed vodka shots was straight LEGIT!

You will find chic and classy dressed Vancouverites at this club, no doubt. Good thing we were dressed the part that night! 

This is a club for Hip Hop Heads like myself. You will not hear too much EDM, although they will throw in a few Top 40 hits here and there. Not only did EVERY SINGLE SONG that the DJ played had us hyped up but we made some new lifelong friends this night as well. 

I cannot wait to be back in VanCity to have so much twerkalicious fun again at Bar None!

Justin, Ray, Saba, Brooklyn, Chris, Ryan, Terry and many others make this an awesome experience.  Bar None is a Vancouver originals and when they hold a special event this club is even better.    Music is a mix of hip hop, top 40 and EDM depending on the night.    They have lots of tables if you and your crew want bottle service and you will be amazed at the spectacle, sights and sounds when they bring out your bottle.

153,Bar None Nightclub,2.5,"Growing up in Vancouver, you get to know the party areas in Vancity pretty well.   Yaletown has the older pricier vibe, Granville is mainstream especially for younger crowds up to dance all night, Gastown is the for the alternative hipster, East Van is for the crays, and Seymour St. has a lot of prostitu....  

But you know this, everyone that came up in this city knows this.  So, when you get told about a nightclub in Yaletown, you already get an image in your head about what you're going to get.  And Bar None portrays that image perfectly.  

So, I don't get why there are so many bad reviews on this place, most from people whining about the high prices.  You already know this being in Yaletown.  If you don't want to get overcharged - don't party in Yaletown.  

Regular cover this night was $30 because there was a special DJ here according to one of my brother's friends who was working the door.   I didn't recognize the DJ, but she was playing a lot of house and decent dance mashups.  The dance floor wasn't packed, but everyone was dancing, there was barely anyone standing to the side.    

My brother's friend apologized for the high cover, told our group he wasn't allowed to give out comps tonight, and told the guestlist girl to give us cover cards so the cashier charged us $15 each, and they let us line skip.   I thought it was nice of him, my brother and his group have started hanging out here more, so at least Bar None takes care of its regulars.  

The people in our group said service at Bar None was always courteous and top-notch to its usuals.   And it struck me as a place with a good amount of the same loyal party goers every weekend.   The place had a fun looking crowd, certainly less intense than on Granville, but otherwise it seemed the same.  The club looked swanky and everything was clean.  

We left to Caprice and Venue later in the night, because we had planned to club hop anyways since it was a Bday Party.  I'd say, overall this place was better than Venue that Saturday night, not as busy as Caprice/L.E.D. bar.",2014-03-22T10:44:56Z,64
154,Bar None Nightclub,2.5,"I don't know if the management or anyone else will even care about this but I had to make an account just to discuss how unfortunate it is to have clubs like this in lower mainland.

For my fiancee's birthday this past Friday, I had a limo bring the 8 of us all the way from Langley to Yaletown just to go to Bar none. I planned the entire night around the end destination being this ""great club"". There were 6 girls and 2 guys and all of us are working professional who were ready to have a great night and drop a good amount of cash in the club since we did not get a chance to pre-drink. Now keep in mind i had guest lists made through emails and I even inquired about table service. I made sure to check their website, Facebook and Instagram week and days in advance to see if they were having any special events and nowhere it was mentioned they were having a private event going that night. So when we all came in line at 10:15 PM for the guest list check-in we begin waiting wondering why are they not moving the Guest list line when it is already 10:40. Once I inquired, we were told they cannot let us in until 11:30. Already frustrated, I talked to the guest list girl and the bouncer and they tell me our guest list and the ""free"" guest list entrance will be honored because we have a good crew and we were not given any notification about this private event. 

We went and killed time at the flying-pig and came back to Bar none at 11:25 and the lineup had already gone out a block. Of course it is always amazing to have a bumping crowd but now even after having a guest list all of us including the other people in the lineup would have to wait as long as an hour if not more because none of them were notified about the event. What's worse is, the club inside was already full house (according to multiple people who came out for a smoke break) but the bouncer (bald-head) gave us ""hope"" that we would get in. Now it is almost 11:40 and line has barely moved. Around this time the bouncer (bald-headed) walked past and i asked if we have to buy tickets to get inside. His response to me was ""yes inside you all have to pay another $15. I mention to him, that he told me our free entrance was going to be honored. He pretends to not hear me and instead says if i want to grease it would be, $30 a pop for the guys and $20 for the girls on top of the ticket. 

If anyone reads this, just know it is not the money that upset me. Unfortunately for them, 8 of us non college kids were really looking forward to having a good night and spend a decent amount. but it is the the ethics, the terrible management, the lies and false hopes given to us and thirst for money that really turned us all off. If i knew earlier, i would have went somewhere else; tbh i would not even have gotten a limo all the way from langley to bar none. 

It is unfortunate people go through terrible experiences like this throughout the years in Vancouver and the nightlife never changes. There will always be these thirsty popular clubs who dominate the scene and really mess up some people's nights and nothing ever changes. Our options here is so limited and the among those limited options we have managements like this running the show who will take advantage of people at all cost.",2019-12-16T18:39:27Z,64

156,Bar None Nightclub,2.5,"Wow. I have never been so fast in writing a terrible review for any place, ever. My policy with new nightclubs is always arrive a little too early and put yourself on the guest list so you don't get stuck waiting. I thought we were pretty safe getting there at 9:50 PM on a Saturday. 

First note: if you think you're going to cash in on the ""no cover"" deal before 11:00 PM, you're dead wrong. They won't let anyone in before that time unless you bribe. Oh yes, we waited until 11. You will be paying the cover NO MATTER WHAT -- what form it comes in, however, is up to you. 

Second note: the bouncers directly request bribes. $20 per pop, not including cover. We finally said what the hell, let's pay the bribe. We went up to pay, nope. Now it's $40 per pop. Totally baffled. We gave up after that and went elsewhere.

Third note: The party in front of us actually had an entire party reserved, with tickets, for a shitton of money. After shelling out hundreds of dollars they too were left to wait in line for over an hour with us. Bouncers still wanted bribes on top of the ridiculous fees they paid (check those rates on their site, totally exorbitant to begin with)

And, finally, fourth note: I'm a 21 year old and even I felt a little too old for this crowd. Some 18 year old douche with a McFlurry haircut budged in line really aggressively in front of me. Told him to get behind. Got jeered at and called a bitch. I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone. Everyone budges, people are entitled as hell, and I feel like a lot of 17-year-olds were in line. Not poppin'.

Seeing as how I live in a ski town, maybe I'm a bit out of touch with the trends in the city, but come on...  These guys seriously need to lay off the hair gel and buy larger shirts.  This is vancouver, not the Jersey shore, and you are NOT a guido, no matter how hard you try.

I was trying to have a fun night out with my girls, and these guys couldn't understand the concept of personal space nor sexual harassment.  If I'm dancing and obviously ignoring you, that is NOT an invitation to grind your package on my backside.  When one of the girls finally had enough and pushed a guy off her, security came up and asked her to leave.

159,Bar None Nightclub,2.5,"The music on Friday night was awesome! The dancing was great too. But neither the music or dancing was enough to justify the astronomical $18 cover charge, the $5 per item coat and bag check in and the crazy ass prices for drinks. $15.50 for two Gin and tonics, that seems expensive to me. Or maybe I'm over exaggerating.

There was a very diverse crowd on Friday night. Seemed like there were super young people and ancient people as well and there were drunks and creepers. Not that it's a bad thing. A variety of people definitely makes for an interesting and entertaining evening. The club itself is super dark, which I don't think is a good thing, you can't really see who you are dancing with. Having beer goggles coupled with the dark can lead to a lethal combination of bad and regretful decisions, not that I made them. That's just not me.

Yes this Nightclub has been around for more than a decade and not much has changed about it. But nothing has to!
The interior still looks as great and with a low key classic look of exposed bricks and wood you can't go wrong. 

The staff here are extremely friendly from doormen, barstaff and management. 

They got three great solid weekly nights and the crowd can change a bit based on those nights. 

Thursdays have DJ Flipout and Jayswing of Straightgoods on The Beat bringing their show live to the Thursday nights of the same name to BarNone. They've been bringing in great Old School Hip Hop/ RnB acts. Great thing is that no one else in town has been doing this and old school hip hop were the glory days of Hip Hop. Bad thing is crowd can get a lil interesting... 

Friday nights here at Bar None is quickly becoming recognized as THE Friday night in Vancouver. The night is hosted by a local promoting group called The Elements Group. The crowd is hot and a lil younger then the avg crowd they get of 25+. Great DJ sets on rotation by Vancouver's Legendary Zak Santiago, DJ Kidd, and DJ Downlowe.

Saturday nights at BarNone has been THE night here for ages. Lines are long and crowds are hot. The music is great as they throw some of the old school classics in with the house/top40 mashups.

I  went on a Saturday night and arrived around 10:30- no line. Great. There were only a handful of people so I left and got drinks nearby When I returned the club was half full, mostly with women.  Later more guys would arrive to stand by the bar drinking and gawking and then go up behind the ladies and grind. Come on guys- either approach the lady with respect or get the hell off the dance floor!

DJ Matty C was the worst DJ-He couldn't transition songs for shit and clearly was not playing to the crowd. I assumed this was the first time he DJ'd but he's the line up every Saturday.  The radio does a better job of playing all the ""hits"" of the week and these days the radio is crap. 

Anyhow, I made the most of it dancing the whole night and laughing.
Maybe this is how Vancouver nightlife is- steep cover, young crowd and bad music. 

The venue was nice (not worth the $18 cover). In San Francisco bar none would be a nice bar with a spacious dance floor with a FREE to a $10 cover, depending  on the night. $18 cover is for a true night club!",2011-08-07T17:56:31Z,64

Felt more like a pub then a club. Younger crowd, high in the Asian population.",2014-04-16T19:32:52Z,64
169,Bar None Nightclub,2.5,"Came by with a friend expecting free cover before 11 pm (as stated on the website), however, there was a charity event taking place, which meant they were letting in the ticket holders first before the regular line, so we missed the deadline. Cover is steep, at $18 a person. 

Zak Santiago was the DJ again that Friday night, and for some reason, he wasn't doing much DJ-ing. It was more like he plugged in his iPod and was just pressing next for the next song. It was probably some of the worst transitions I have ever heard. And his song selections were awful: most songs were too slow to dance to, or he would mix in some indecipherable mix in the middle of the song (usually in the chorus, an odd spot to put it), which didn't even mesh well with the song. It was just a terrible set.

There were not enough bartenders, which meant long waits for really weak drinks. 

A complete disappointment. I probably will not go back to this club again.",2011-07-25T03:08:51Z,64
170,Bar None Nightclub,2.5,"Beautiful people, colourful drinks, snazzy bathrooms ... a true night club in the heart of Vancouver's trendiest hood, Yaletown.

Bar None attracts an older crowd (25 and over), and is, much of the time, dominated by local professionals from the film, media, and fashion industries.

Bar None provides a real contrast to the bars just a few blocks away on Granville Street, which seem more geared toward the beer-guzzling fraternity crowd.

Bar None features a fabulous long bar, a dance floor whose boundaries are blurred by nearby barstools and tables, and cozy enclaves with low, cushioney couches. A live DJ is normally the main feature of a night at Bar None, and this can influence the price of cover.

Dress code is nicer than casual; try a nice pair of pants, a sexy dress, or your favourite designer button-up.",2008-10-20T18:46:50Z,64
171,Bar None Nightclub,2.5,"I must admit that I am surprised the overall rating currently to Bar None is three out of five stars. During my visit to Yaletown this past weekend (visiting from Seattle), I was recommended that i check out ""Bar None"". By dumb luck, we ended up on the wedding party guest list and was able to enter at 10pm on Friday night before everyone else. On Saturday night, we must have made a good impression because the woman at the door remembered us and pushed us up to the front of the busy line. The personnel here is wonderful in general (not just saying that). 

The first thing I noticed was the very nice layout of this place. They built it in a way that is very accommodating to the dancing crowd (big dance floors) yet accessible to those wanting to a drink quickly. I very much appreciate that they limit the crowd they let in. Normally, when at a club, it is near impossible to get to the bar for a drink. At Bar None, it is busy but you do not get frustrated trying to accomplish your goals. 

On Friday night you get the wide range of rock, club and hip hop music. Saturday evening is purely club / techo. I only had a three day visit to Vancouver this past weekend, but I enjoyed Bar None so much I had to go twice. It had a great mix of people and the age range appeared to be from 24-37. 

And if Bar None doesn't appeal to you when you go there (after reading these review), there are a great number of bars you can hop on Hamilton and Mainland Street.",2011-07-28T06:33:27Z,64
172,Bar None Nightclub,2.5,"As my BFF puts it... ""bar get none""...  

That should pretty much sum it up.

The music was good - I had fun anyways there. Bartenders are pretty attentive and quick.  The staff pretty smiley as you enter and leave.  I liked the exposed brick and wood decor.  Bathrooms/coat check are all downstairs.  Lots of decent looking people and well dressed (not trashy).  Wish we had more of that from the bar hopping/club going people in Seattle.",2010-06-22T21:39:16Z,64
173,Bar None Nightclub,2.5,"Getting into Bar None (despite the name) can be tough, DHM is widely known for having the toughest clubs in the city to get passed the doors, even on the guestlist expect a wait (see my getting passed the ropes guide for a few hints).

Once you are in you will be amongst some of the hottest people in the city, in an ultra cool, new york loft esq space. The exposed brick and wooden beams you see in Bar None are not unlike anything you expect to see down any random alley in the meat packing district, and being right in the heart of Yaletown, all of the beautiful people that congregate at Glowbal, Earls, Section 3, and other various resto / lounges scattered in the area, migrate to Bar None around midnight.

When you walk in there is an extremely long bar down the left hand side of the room. This bar can get full and even though its really long there are usually not enough bartenders to handle it. On the right side of the room in the corner closest to the entrance you'll see a much smaller bar, that is also usually fairly crowded, but most of the time is easier to get a drink at.....what are you waiting for, get a drink! Get me one while your at it.

The rest of the room is very wide open with the DJ playing in the back right corner. If you are there on a night resident Matty C is spinning, then you got a good night and probably a packed dance floor.

The bottle service area is just passed the DJ booth inside the VIP area, there is also a bar in the back of this area, but in less your incredibly hot, know someone there, or are buying bottles, you'll never see this bar, and if you're buying bottles you won't need to.

Don't worry though, you're not missing much if you can't get back into this area, just hotter, richer, and generally more important people than probably every crowd you've ever encountered. Do yourself a favor - say yes to bottle service.",2011-05-06T02:46:39Z,64

The decor in the place is pretty swank and the bartenders and bouncers are actually friendly... (WHAT?! I know, it's hard to believe!!).. and its in Yaletown!!

The drinks here are expensive, so I would recommend pre-gaming at someones house or a cheaper bar before heading to the main spot. Making a guest list would be pretty smart, but the only thing is then you have to make sure you're here before 10pm - which is not always possible. 

Nonetheless, this place is always a good time with their fantastic mix of music and their classy crowd.",2008-08-27T19:50:41Z,64
175,Bar None Nightclub,2.5,"What I love: the music, the big dance floor, no lack of guys wanting to buy you drinks, and the older crowd. God knows i'm not 19 anymore...and i'm ok with that.

What I dislike: 18$ cover plus 5$ coat check. This is the first I've paid to get into a club in awhile. I suppose it could be worse. Also, as much as I appreciate free drinks, the guys here have a tendency to be super pushy. I noticed last time too, but took it as a one off. This time it was the same. Really aggressive, and randomly coming out of nowhere. It was kinda creepy. I don't go to clubs nearly as often as I used to, but I just don't remember experiencing this anywhere else, and am not comfortable with that kind of attention. Maybe next time I'll wear a muu muu just to be sure i'm not sending out the wrong message.

Turns out there was three events booked at once AND Cole Sprouse was in there so a TON of people paid more or girls squeezed in and by passed all the people who already had pre paid tickets.

Nicely decorated, loved the long bar, drinks were fairly priced but a bit watered down. DJ was very good and open to requests. The crowd was a good mix, lots of well dressed people just there to have a great time. Huge dance floor, pretty much the entire front end of the place was one massive dance floor. 

The night went well, the only part that sucked was the long walk back to the Westin in freezing rain at 3AM in the morning, not a single cab in sight!",2010-03-28T21:16:54Z,64
179,Bar None Nightclub,2.5,"We were buying bottles, so we had the privilege of sitting in the VIP section...  Guess thats what a few hundred in drinks will get you...  

Not sure if we paid a cover or not as I wasn't responsible for the planning, the limo to pick us up from the Donnelly group was nice.  We were whisked in to the front, and taken to our table.  

The waitress staff were beautiful.  An 11 out of 10.  Can't complain with that.  :-)  

We were continually stocked with tonic, soda, ice, etc for our bottles, and they were prompt with getting us anything else we needed.  Like orders of shots.  Lots of shot, oh god.

The music was way too loud with one of the speakers directly overhead us.  It should be moved from that area/corner!  

The DJ's were just okay.  What sucked, was a song only played for about a minute and was mixed into the next track.  Sure, it keeps things lively.  But look at the crowd, watch their pulse.  Perhaps there is an anthem going on that people love, yet you switch tracks!  Lame.

The bathrooms were in pretty poor shape.  One urinal was out of order, and draped in plastic.  The sink soap dispensers were not working, so there was this open bottle of soap on the counter of the sink.  It was quite gross.  Then you turn around and walk about 3 meters to a dyson hand dryer.  No towels, only one hand dryer, and it's too far from the sinks.  Bad design.  Oh not to mention the toilets sitting unflushed and looking rather disgusting throughout the night.  

Still though, it's a great crowd, with good looking people.",2011-05-07T19:41:11Z,64

184,Bar None Nightclub,2.5,"We went here for a birthday party. We started the night well and enjoyed ourselves. Until we were followed around the dance floor by some guys. Each time we told them to move or leave they didn't listen. They would  grab us by the waist or even touch us inappropriately. After many attempts to lose them, we had finally had enough. IT IS NOT OKAY TO TOUCH ME ESPECIALLY WHEN I SAY NO! At this point they were ruining our night and my friends birthday. I get that this is the ""club culture"". But its not okay. So we went to the nearest security guard to report it, since this is consider sexual harassment. He was a tall guy with a beard, he told us he will keep an eye out. Thats awesome! But after he told us to just go join this group of middle aged men at the VIP table and enjoy the night. WTF?! as if hanging out with older men would make things better. Also what are you trying to do? It seemed like his concern was for us to not report anything to management and to not give this club a bad rep. Luckily only 2/5 of us were buzzed, so someone was always there to shove off the perverted guys. But if I was there by myself and drunk, I believe the security wouldn't have done anything. To end this rant, this isn't a safe club, security should take their job more seriously, sexual harassment is not okay!",2017-02-12T05:57:27Z,64
185,Bar None Nightclub,2.5,"Honestly, Bar None is a decent club - but I don't think it should have a page on yelp, because it's trying desperately to be as exclusive as possible. It shouldn't even be advertised to the public, because it's basically a private club for rich people and friends of the owners.

You will absolutely NOT get in until you whip your wallet out for security. I honestly can't believe that this place can be so greedy to expect this. $20 EACH. I have been clubbing a lot of places, and while the security are usually unfriendly jackasses, NEVER have I been forced to pay them in order to be allowed in. After this, $20 each for cover. And then $5 each for coat check. Before I've even hit the dance floor I've spent more than I normally do in a whole weekend.

After the giant slap in the face at the door, I was expecting the reveal of a Las Vegas-calibre superclub with tons of hot go-go dancers, light shows, flair bartending and great music. Unfortunately none of these things was included. It was dark, smelled like a smoke machine, full of annoying people, and blaring with annoying music. Attention DJ, if you're going to play music that you can hear for free on the radio, at least have the decency to mix it into a house track. There were go-go dancers, but they were dancing up against the wall, seemed like they didn't know how to dance, and, big surprise, they were only visible from the VIP section.

Unsurprisingly, the bartenders were just as unfriendly and douchey as security. We paid for drinks with a credit card (because we blew all of our cash at the door), and they automatically added a 25% tip and made us sign some stupid waiver (not the receipt) that authorized them to do so. When was the last time you tipped someone that much? Sigh.

Well, I think I've made it pretty obvious that Bar None ruined my weekend. I implore you..unless you are friends with security or management here, stay away!!",2012-06-30T17:42:58Z,64

Also the bouncers did not seem to notice my friend being sexually harassed continuously by men who thought it was OK to touch her and harass her after they'd been turned down. Continually creepy vibe from a lot of the male patrons as the night went on. The DJ played hip hop and top 40 mostly, but it wasn't very danceable for the most part. OK prices for drinks I guess, beautiful room, lots of bars so you don't have to wait too long for a drink, nice bathroom and beautiful dance floor. Beautiful architecture and lighting.

Aside from not having to pay for a cover (I was DRAGGED here for a friends party. She knew someone to get us in but something tells me it was the short dress that got us in. I guess that adds for the one star and saving myself the insane cover charge) I had an okay time. Don't know if I'd want to relive it. Maybe if I was 20, or younger. Wow I seriously sounded old right there!

Whisked away inside to coat check, a huge woman's bathroom (add a star) and then back upstairs into one of the smallest VIP rooms I've ever been in. I looked beyond the velvet ropes to the dance floor while uttering the words to my friends with a tear to my eye; ""I want to be on that side of the rope. Dancing with everyone else, drinking with everyone else. I want to live among those common people.""

Drunk of course I was. Talking like Yoda and referencing the band Pulp I was too! With a glass of free champagne from the VIP room I broke through the ropes and danced, poorly, among the crowd. The music here is your general top 40/mash ups. It's not bad, it's not good, but it was something for my drunk ass to  dance to.

I didn't see one cute guy here. Maybe I did? Everyone looks cute when I'm drunk. Wait I saw a few, but they were taken. I don't know about you but being groped by guys at a dance club when your with the girls isn't what I call a fun time. Don't get me wrong, groping is alright... if it's with someone you want to be groped with. And then I left.

If you open a tab they put a +$60 hold on your credit/debit card. Scary.

I have been to clubs in NYC, Miami, Montreal and Europe-never once had this happen to me. 

I heard great things about this place so when I first came here and was the only one here at 11:30pm I waited around a bit. A few more people came and went. After a while I just couldn't take it, I left extremely disappointed. 

Another night I came here the place was pretty packed but not one person was dancing. It felt like a high school party, groups of people talking to each other and guys on one side, ladies on the other.

They also made the place smaller by putting in a VIP lounge, bad move in my opinion. They also used to have a great funk band playing there every Monday and Tuesday called ""Soul Stream"" but they don't play their anymore, unfortunately.

Extortionately expensive cover and drinks - for the amount I was forced to spend on entry and a measly 2 watered down drinks I could easily have gone to one or two much better events with global DJs. At the end of the night I felt as if I had been robbed.
The waitresses were very friendly however, and the staff had a really nice attitude. However the DJ's taste in music was extremely questionable, and there were a few moments in the night where he transitioned with absolutely horrible key clashes. 
The crowd present were in general quite rich and pretentious. There were many creepy old men as well.
The club itself is nice, with a good looking bar and a large dancefloor. However this was pretty much completely negated by them overcharging for cover and drinks, terrible music choices with the lack of a skillful DJ, as well as the crowd who seemed self-infatuated if they were not perverted old men.
As one of my first non-event club nights in Vancouver, this club has put me off going clubbing on regular nights, as I just got completely ripped off for an honestly terrible night.",2011-01-08T20:57:15Z,64

211,Numbers Cabaret,2.9,"Nice vibe and the karaoke room upstairs pretty fun! Stopped by in our second night in Vancouver.. The bartenders were super nice and helpful and we appreciated that the crowd was a little older than the crowd we saw outside of celebrities.

Pros:
-Three different levels with a bar on every floor and decently priced drinks (Double Jameson 7, $13)... not too bad.
-Loved the people we met that night.. super friendly and didn't get that creeper vibe.
-The karaoke system was awesome because when you put in a song, it tells you about what time you'll be up to sing your song!

Cons:
-The bathroom was small... like the two urinals were like right next to each other. 
-The bench seats next to the karaoke room was not comfortable to sit on for a long time, but maybe that's okay. Haha",2019-12-30T18:55:56Z,35

Can I say, that you are my speed dial #8 and still be not offended? :P  I still value you though, so please don't hate me.

This is a place where I feel safe, at home, or a place where I just like hang out and not see people I know. I love hanging upstairs with a beer with my friends and just chatting up instead of the dance floor, and the ""basement"" area.

I love the karaoke area too, it is a fun place to be with a couple friends, meet new people, and just have a great time with drinks.

Then the staff are rude. Holy crap how can service staff get away with doing so poorly one of the main facets of their job. Trust me, I've worked the service industry and I'd have been fired over and over had I acted like they did. 

Next is the drink prices: the same two drinks we got at Pumpjack ($11), Junction ($12), Numbers($13+) and it was poorly made.

I don't think the place has been cleaned or updated in years since it opened. There was a definite smell of stale air and beer emanating from the carpet and the washroom floor was sticky. I hate how the businesses on Davie feel at liberty to price gouge the gay community they purport to serve. .. Best thing would be to call it a day and turn the place into low income housing for the homeless.,2018-12-01T16:46:34Z,35

The coat check is $2 per item, when I asked why was it like this, the guy gave me my jacket back, and called me a fucking ass. Then he said he was closed right in my face; when I went away, he reopened right after.

223,Numbers Cabaret,2.9,"I'm not sure why, but I always thought Numbers was a bear bar? I guess since the Odyssey was a twink bar, I just assumed that the bears needed a bar too, not that they don't already have Pumpjack, but where do bears go to dance? Do bears dance? I know they ride unicycles, but that's about it....

In any case, when I went to Numbers, I was surprised that there weren't really any bears there at all, so I was confused as to why I kept thinking it was a bear bar? Was it ever a bear bar? Where the heck did I get this crazy fantasy? The music was pretty good, mostly top 40 remixed stuff, but not mash-up garbage where you only get to hear one minute of each song. 

The drinks were decent, we went to the downstairs bar to order some drinks and hid in the shadows down there for a while people watching. It never got super busy, but it was only the first time I had been there, so who knows what its like during other days of the week. 

The real question is, why is it called Numbers? Do guys play the numbers game here? Do you leave with other people's numbers? (For the record, I didn't.) Why not digits then? I just feel like all the other gay bars have gay names, like Celebrities, the Pumpjack, the Odyssey.... with a name like Numbers, you're not really sure who's number you're gonna get.",2011-03-22T00:58:45Z,35
224,Numbers Cabaret,2.9,"I came here on a date last week.

Probably not the best place to go on a date on a Saturday night but you know what? I had A LOT of fun.

They take your photo as you enter whilst the check your ID. I found this weird. Does this place have a history of bad things happening?

The beer was not great and expensive. Not a surprise for this type of bar on Davie.

The music was trashy cheesy pop and it was amazing. When I go to a gay club to dance I want to dance to trashy pop. I want to feel like Ke$ha just vomited glitter on me.

The crowd was fairly mixed but there was most certainly more of an older mix compared to the likes of Junction or 1181.

Fun atmosphere? - Yes

Cattle Market? - Yes

Will I return? - Yes

It's a pretty small bar/club and the dancefloor is very very busy. So the biggest issue is how claustrophobic this can make you feel but ya know what when you're drunk you aint gonna care honey!",2013-10-21T19:25:47Z,35

The manager greeted us at the door and once he found out we were at celebs he suddenly decided we were too ""intoxicated"" and didn't want us inside. We were definitely not and were fully shocked seeing as they had almost no customers inside, besides a group of people outside smoking who saw us on the street and suggested we check it out inside. We intended on making it our spot for the night but the so-called ""manager"" seemed to wanna close up early and refused to let us in. Definitely see why it is never busy. You have a few die-hard fans who are supporting the business but you refuse to expand your client base. Not a smart business move.",2019-06-19T10:09:08Z,35

The door staff and bartenders were very friendly and the drinks priced pretty accordingly to a Davie street club.

It was a slow night. Not that I was really expecting a packed bar at 10pm on a Thursday night but still. At least the music was good! Still pretty boring though. We only stayed for about an hour and just headed on down to the beer and wine store before closing. Oh, and apparently you have to pay for karaoke? Hmm.",2011-03-22T21:46:22Z,35

I tend to gravitate there solely for their Thursday bear night in the loft. The top floor , the loft, is a pretty chill place with it's own bar, pool table and tables/benches if you aren't really in the mood to dance or people watch.

The staff and clientele is very nice, but even with a very good sound system, a decent sized dancefloor, and being nearly half full it was boring as hell! The DJ was terrible and played really corney Latin music, no fun reggeaton. And pretty much no one danced.

The dance floor is somewhat small, but it was enough to accommodate the crowd. There's a bar just a few steps above the dance floor. The club has five floors. Upstairs is a pool table.
There was a nice mix of guys in the club in terms of looks. Most people were 25 to 50 years old.

242,Numbers Cabaret,2.9,"Truth is, I did not enter Numbers so this review is about their weird admission procedure.  Several decades ago when I visited Vancouver for the first time, I went to Numbers.  I recall is was a large no-attitude bar that attracted a diverse gay male clientele.  Relaxed and casual, I had a good time there and was looking forward to going back recently.  As others have reported, they now have an entry procedure more severe and unwelcoming than border crossing immigration in third world countries.  No only did they want to scan my ID, record my name in their data base and take a photo with a camera mounted at the door.  If I agreed to that, which I didn't, I might have had to undergo fingerprinting, a retina scan and even a polygraph exam before ordering a beer!   It's true that gay people are less closeted nowadays but that still doesn't justify the gratuitous collection of personal information from customers entering a public establishment.  I refused, and went up the street to Pumpjack where I just walked in the door, ordered a drink, and had a relaxing enjoyable evening.

Meanwhile, behind me I saw countless girls leave the line because there were so many guys stalling the line.

In one hour I saw so many girls leave the line cuz it wasn't moving. Then only guys were going in because that's only who wanted to wait. 

Funny thing is I waited one hour, my friend was inside, he told me the club was full of guys: I left try line. I went to the next bar over, the first girls I talked to, they had stamps for this club, then they let me in. And confirmed, legit the ratio on dance floor was 9:1 guys to girls.

250,Studio Lounge & Nightclub,2.2,"It is not a surprise that this business has very low rating.
Today, I was attacked and aggressively mistreated by two of their staff before even entering the place .
I am a Customer Service instructor at the College that organized this fund raising party of today at Studio.
I was accompanying my students after class and right at the entrance, I got surprised by their questionable policy of charging $5 dollars (which must be paid in cash only) for their mandatory coat or bag checking. A practice that sounds more like a way of making easy money than of safety matters.
After questioning the staff member about the policy, he raised his voice and yelling, took me outside to show me the Policy plate on the wall. Shocked by his overreaction to my question and disrespectful tone of voice, I decided not entering the place and go home but not before being aggressively attack by another staff member, a man wearing a hat, coat and sunglasses, who came from outside, grabbed my arm, and started yelling and threatening me. He only backed off after I decided to call the Police.
In many years of working in customer service around the world, this is the very first time I was treated like a criminal, physically attack by those who should be providing information and hosting those who pay their salaries. I had equipments in my bag, camera, computer, lenses and I am not confident that, if something gets misplaced, broken or stolen, the establishment will provide me any refund.
I understand the policy of bag and coat checking for safety reasons, but I also believe that the place must then provide individual lockers, with keys or a free of charge option that is not secure enough like in this case, as many other bars and places do.
At least this nasty experience I had today serves as an example to my student of bad customer service practices.

Parking here sucks. Come by after 2200.

The evening we went (Monday) it was (drunken) karaoke night. Definitely entertaining to watch people belt out tunes and sing along. Because of this, the venue felt more like a meeting area than a dance club. Not a bad thing. Oh yeah, the music wasn't deafening. Another plus.

Drink pricing is in line with other similar places.

The owner seems to pick who enters, so prepare yourself to wait a stupid amount of time in line. 

And while you're waiting, make sure you don't get hit by the body guards because almost every 20mins they are literally throwing a body out like the trash. Way too many fights happen at this place.

Once you finally get in, the owner will signal to the cover girl wether he wants you to pay or not (witnessed many people in front of me not having to pay cover). Hand her $20 for the worst night of clubbing you'll ever experience. 

If you enjoy getting harassed by a bunch of males standing in the doorway to the women's bathroom (that actually has no door to it so they can watch you the whole time) this is the place! The floor is covered in garbage, underwear, broken bottles/ glasses and toilet paper. 

It's absolutely disgusting. Stalls don't even close.

Once you finally push through the crowds and on to the dance floor you're immersed in mediocre music. Drinks are whatever, nothing special and overpriced.

Gone are the awesome paintings of famous rock stars, rappers and movie actors/actresses.  Gone are the projectors screening music videos and movies into the large picture frames.  They have been replaced by something more simple.  

The dance floor is just as big.  But there is a difference.  I can't quite put my finger on it.

They have added a record store in the club.  They now sell records during the day!  It's actually very interesting.  Also, they have brought back the huge neon sign that glows at night.  If you're going down into the basement you can see how this space used to look with the same sign back in the 60's????  I don't even know how old that photo is.",2015-07-27T03:53:34Z,33

257,Studio Lounge & Nightclub,2.2,"Hahah I don't really know where to start. 2 hour wait with a bouncer who doesn't care if drunk college boys cut the queue after everyone has been waiting. Doesn't matter if the entire line tells the bouncer that they have cut. Trying to give the benefit of the doubt, we go inside only to find the venue cramped and reeking of a stale alcohol smell.  Overpriced drinks for the quality. Impossible to navigate and we left after 30 minutes. Don't waste your time here.",2018-11-18T09:26:55Z,33
258,Studio Lounge & Nightclub,2.2,"I gotta say, I did not like this place because I found thier drinks to taste ""watered"" down and their staff to be rude. the security were really rude and the wait to get in was super long. i felt like i was treated as if they were doing me a favor by letting me in - heres a suggestion: if you dont like working in customer service then maybe dont work in customer service.",2019-01-28T03:54:51Z,33
259,Studio Lounge & Nightclub,2.2,"Probably the worst customer service I've ever received. Went on a Wednesday night exploring the town minding our own business. Miss Lady comes up and says ""Hey a free drink with your admission"". Being the classy fella I am I simply couldn't turn down a free drink. Ended up paying for the entrance, and upon asking for the drink (lady gave us a ticket) the bartender says ""nope sorry, it's past midnight"" in a rude tone of voice. Looked at my buddy and said ""F it man."" Long story short, place was horrible and the drinks were even worse! Don't go here unless you plan on paying for $10 CAD nasty drinks.",2018-07-05T23:37:28Z,33
260,Studio Lounge & Nightclub,2.2,"Wished I could give them .5 star because Seriously, worst club ever. Went with my boyfriend and the bouncers kicked him about because ""he was drunk"" but honestly I was MORE DRUNK than he was. My friends and us were just standing there and talking. We were in there for less than 30 minutes. When we got outside, the bouncer didn't give us any explanation and we couldn't say anything either. There was a huge line up outside so I'm guessing they were just kicking random people. Idk if this is true but we were the only Chinese people there too so maybe a tad racist? horrible club. Don't recommend lol. Btw the bouncers were total assholes!!!! Don't even try to negotiate because they won't give a fuck!",2019-02-24T09:53:57Z,33
261,Studio Lounge & Nightclub,2.2,"Worst staff and terrible, unreasonable wait time. Even though we were in the guest list, we ended up waiting for 45+ minutes, watching others come in like no problem. Didn't expect such horrible treatment coming down from Seattle for one night. Thanks for ruined night.",2018-08-19T06:57:31Z,33
262,Studio Lounge & Nightclub,2.2,"Interesting idea, putting a record store together with a live band club, only trouble is the two seem to be separate entities, when the record store part is open, the club is closed and vice versa. I guess that makes sense, not sure how many club goers would be in the market for a record when they're out for a night on the town.  As for the club, it's got a great space for live music and for the most part the sound crew take full advantage of it. Not sure what a metal band might sound like in here, but the lower Db bands sound great. The big dance floor comes with a matching giant chandelier, and the main bar is a towering thing of bottle beauty, well lit and well stocked. Drink prices are standard club prices, so maybe have a drink or two somewhere else before you get there. The cover was $12 on a Friday night for three bands, not that bad and besides the money goes to the bands. After the bands get done, the club becomes, well a club.  DJs set up and start spinning and for the most part the crowd changes over from the live band patrons to the disco dancing crowd. Studio Records hosts different functions on different nights, like any club that's trying to stay in business does, but if your friend ever tells you they're playing here, make a point to see them, the sound is great and the club has a nice, open vibe to it, making for a wonderful evening.  

I will update this review when I get down to check out the record store part of the deal, but as someone divesting his record collection, it may take a while.",2017-06-17T20:05:47Z,33
263,Studio Lounge & Nightclub,2.2,"Well, I was assaulted by one of those securities because I complained that i had to leave my jacket with the receptionist and i wasn't even talk the them when i was complaining. I spoke with the manager but of course he chose his staff. The security tried to fight with me, pushing me out and I didn't argue with him, he just keep pushing me out without even listen what I was trying to explain. You can not treat customers like that. The staffs were very rude and unprofessional . International Saturday don't go.  Apparently they need to learn a little bit of customer service. 
I dont recommend this place to anybody.",2019-09-22T22:55:59Z,33
264,Studio Lounge & Nightclub,2.2,"Baby steps, I guess.

After reading the news articles touting the arrival of this ""unique"" joint, I was looking forward to making this a regular haunt. My first visit was to the record store / bar upstairs. Not too much to rave about. The selection isn't bad, but weak in comparison to a true record store. I did spot a few things that were reasonably priced. There are sale bins too, which is nice.
The bar component is casual and directly alongside the records, with a few stand-up tables.

I returned on a second occasion for an evening out with friends, having seen a guestlist option on their Facebook page. Prior to, I filled out the form and received an email confirmation. When we arrived, the host had no clue what guestlist I was talking about, claiming that they didn't have one on their website. I showed the form and email confirmation on my phone to her and another staff member, and they denied knowing anything about it, and asked for a $12 cover. 

I tried to appeal to the other staff member, but he kept saying ""That's not my pay grade"", and called me ""uppity"". First time I ever got that. This is too damn frustrating. 
After talking to a manager ourselves, we were let in. 

The club was hosting a series of amateur bands, mostly grunge-style. The sound was alright, the bar was ok. The record shop upstairs was closed. I don't know if both areas of the venue are ever open at the same time, but it would have been better if it was.

Immediately after the live bands concluded, a new crowd infiltrated and a DJ fired up his Serato and started playing hip-hop. We took off.

Summary - it's just another Granville Street joint.",2015-08-29T21:28:19Z,33
265,Studio Lounge & Nightclub,2.2,"Amazing venue for live music at night time. I was absolutely blown away by the great sounds and stage performances seen at this place. The bartenders are friendly and knowledgable.

Great spot for date night.",2015-10-27T00:05:44Z,33
266,Studio Lounge & Nightclub,2.2,Worst place to go to! Very disorganized! Instead of having a line they make everyone gather around the entrance. Clusters of people blocking the entrance. SECURITY guys are rude and cursing towards customers. If I could put a half star I would. No doubt about that. I'm a tourist here and this was the worst experiences!,2019-01-20T18:50:40Z,33
267,Studio Lounge & Nightclub,2.2,"This place was pretty scummy my friend and I lost a painting we bought of the street (Scarface lighting a cigar) we came Back the next day and asked them to check around for it and they didn't even look in lost and found just told us they didn't have it. So later that night while I'm looking at the wall of paintings they have lo and behold our painting is on their wall and of course we took it back, I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for an honest establishment.",2019-05-13T18:05:33Z,33
268,Studio Lounge & Nightclub,2.2,"It took me a while to get here in spite of all the written hype. Seems like a great concept..record store by day and then a full night club at night. I see that they're trying to model themselves after what has made a popular trend in LA in which this sort of format works, however, there are things that are failing this concept. 

1. It's just not the right type of record collecting market. 
2. People having to go home early due to transit doesn't make the whole club late, buy records and spin at club model passable. 
3. Limited hours of operation during the day. 
4. Majority of new and re-issue titles similar to Urban Outfitters....just skipping the annoying teenagers shopping for a Velvet Underground re-issue and buying a mini skirt. 
5. Both the record store and club need to be open at the same time. People make awesome drunk music purchases. 

This isn't to say that this is a bad store, it's just got a long way to go. Perhaps if they carried very good condition or mint condition quality vintage items they would have a leg up in the market to at least be taken seriously. 

If you want to come for club night be prepared to pay $10 cover + which is a joke. This is a cover with no real bands playing. I see indie bands at Venue for a more reasonable cost = what a joke. 

This needs to be considered a club and less of a music store. If that is the case it's just like every other Tom, Dick and Harry on Granville Street....yawn. 

As a music venue it has good potential. 

Don't bother reading the Facebook event pages...very misleading. Many times I have shown up with friends after a show at either Venue or at the Commodore (not ready to go home yet) and the guy at the door wasn't in the know about the evenings events in spite of my friends pulling up the event on their phone from their own Facebook page. 

Decor is reasonable and nice.",2015-12-11T05:53:23Z,33
269,Studio Lounge & Nightclub,2.2,"This place is pretty janky. Everything seems... sticky? There are lots of aggressive dudebros from the suburbs (actually, from Abbotsford lol) hitting on the girls and the bouncers do nothing. Absolutely will back up what others have said on here that bouncers seem to artificially try to keep the lines looking long and kick people out arbitrarily. One of my friends got kicked out for ""being too drunk"" when we were literally dancing all together and being quiet and were all the same level of drunk. Not sure what the bouncer's problem was but they were pretty rude to us when we asked what was up. I won't be coming back here again?

271,Studio Lounge & Nightclub,2.2,"I've been here a few times on a Saturday night 'cause it's latin music night. Music depends on the DJ playing, so for me personally was better at times and not others. Cover is steep at $20, but there's a discount if you're there on guest list before 9:30 PM. There are no drink specials. The staff can be friendlier. Bouncers seem to kick people out arbitrarily. We asked a bouncer why he had just kicked a guy out and he said 'cause he was too drunk. Unless we missed a back story, he was just standing there keeping to himself not bothering anybody. The female washroom needs to be renovated, but at least the stalls need hooks to hang your stuff. There are 2 areas upstairs that are for VIP, but they should open this up to anybody 'cause the main area downtairs is just one big square shape.

272,Studio Lounge & Nightclub,2.2,"This place is a joke. I wish I could rate it a zero but unfortunately 1 is as low as I can go. The manager/ owner iggy or whatever is an idiot and is a rude liar. I was there on new year night and it was a below average night, crappy music and the DJ wouldn't play anything even though EVERYONE was requesting he change it from his garbage techno samples. drinks are far to expensive. However I can deal with that, the thing I CANT deal with is how rude the ""manager"" iggy is. When trying to leave my friends and I went to grab our jackets, everyone got theirs back right away except mine so I patiently waited while they looked for my jacket. Nothing. I ended up waiting for nearly an HOUR for my jacket. At this point I was drunk and crying because I would have to leave in the winter freezing cold dressed in clubbing clothes. We talked to iggy who was basically just trying to dismiss us and get us out of there. He said if they couldn't find my jacket by the end of the night that I could come back and that he could reimburse me for it. Even the coat check girls admitted that it either fell on the floor and got lost or someone else had taken it. I was upset but I could manage going home nearly freezing to death knowing that I could at least get reimbursed. However the next day when my friend and I tried to contact him he first accused us of not having the ticket (which we sent him pictures for proof) and tried to say that I did get my jacket. Why on earth would I have left crying in the freezing cold if I had gotten my jacket. We tried to meet with him which he agreed to a day and time but never showed up to and ignored our texts asking if he was still coming till hours after saying he's ""out of town"" which honestly is probably a lie. Now he ignores all our calls, texts, emails everything. He's a joke of a manager. Total jerk who runs a shitty club. I don't recommend coming here at all, there's a million better clubs you can go to. Save your time and your money and stay away from this joke of a place. Screw this club and all its employees. Garbage.",2019-01-13T02:56:39Z,33
273,Hello Goodbye,3.7,"Hello Goodbye had some good drinks and nice booth seating areas, but that is probably the only positive things I have to say about this place. Hello Goodbye was very tricky to find and the girl at the front was barely any help. 

I mean, I just feel like this is the spot for 19-year-olds who want to party semi-privately, half-naked and with layers and layers of make-up. It's a hip spot so I guess it's popular?",2020-06-25T21:13:37Z,34
274,Hello Goodbye,3.7,"I heard about this place from an article in the Daily hive, which pointed out they have a happy hour from 6-8pm Wednesdays through Saturdays. $6 beer, $7 wine, and $8 cocktails plus dollar dumplings ($4 for a steamer basket containing 4 dumplings, either prawn, chicken, pork, or veggie). The dumplings are a little on the small side and aren't the best I've had compared to dim sum places in the area, but they're also not terrible.

I went to check it out with 4 others on a Wednesday around 7pm, and the place was almost deserted - just one other couple besides us in our corner booth. It's hard to find too; there's no obvious signage, and you have to enter through an unmarked red door in a corridor beside a barber shop. Head down some stairs and there's another unmarked door, and suddenly you're in a pretty cool looking little bar with booths along one wall, small tables along the other, and room for dancing in the middle.

According to the waitress, it gets busy later in the evening (9pm and later) and is more of a late night club, though a slightly older age range, she estimated normally around 25-45. They have live music and DJs on the weekends, and the booths go for $600 with bottle service vodka. Yikes! 

The house wine was good and the cocktails we tried were delicious and definitely generous on the alcohol side - just one glass of wine and one cocktail and I had a headache in the morning! Prices definitely would add up outside of happy hour however. If you're into trendy little late night dance clubs definitely check this place out, especially on a Friday when they have the live music.",2017-06-29T19:36:50Z,34
275,Hello Goodbye,3.7,"Saturday night was girls night so we thought we would check this place out. It's a little tricky to find! It's located beside Barber and Co, down a set of red stars. There was no door person parked outside until about 10pm. We came early, 8:30ish to enjoy some happy hour time, which is 8-10 pm. Drinks are $8 for cocktails, wine $7, beer $4. Dumplings are $1/per. There ware a few different kinds (chicken, prawn ect) but that is it for food. 

Place is very small, much smaller than I was expecting, but very cool interior. Booths running along the walls, all of which were reserved. Dim lighting and modern. Large open space in the center I assume they use for dancing later on. Annoyed, because I wanted to try their dumpling while I relaxed and drank a few bevies. I'm not a stand and eat kind of person. There was one table for people standing that fit about two or three people. There easily could have been a few more tables with bar stools to accommodate guests. They removed all the bar seats in front of the bar so there were only about 5 on the side. I dunno why. I see doing it at like 11 if it's busy and u want bartending space. There was only one guy tending and it was dead so.... 

It was pretty quiet still, with no where to sit and 90% of the reserved seating empty, we decided to try a drink then leave.

Drinks were just okay. Overly sweet for sure, which I did read in previous reviews. Regular prices are like $14 ect. I tried the Starboy which is basically an old fashioned made with Henneay. Way too sweet and too much ice, which made it difficult to drink.

I would try again if I could reserve a table. It would be nice if there was more space, seats and food.",2018-02-12T21:23:04Z,34

The place was pretty small and empty when I went, but it slowly filled up after 11.

It was pretty quiet just before 10pm, but there was live music from a super talented guy.  Bartenders were super nice.  We ended up getting table service, which was somewhere in the $300-400 range USD for a bottle of Bulleit, which costs like $20 at home, but we got the whole table and seating area for the night, which was nice. Plus they were really good about bringing us more water, limes, diet coke, etc.

It was a group of 5 of us girls that had been there spending money all night and then they didn't let our sixth girlfriend in to join us and told us even if she waited in line that she wouldn't get in. WTF?! For 6 girls??? Worst service. Side note: wasn't IDed and they free-poured. Not impressed. This is why I don't like Vancouver.

To be honest it is not my scene in terms of relaxation in terms of decor but I get it and I see why this is one of the new trends in downtown Vancouver. I was there for the company. They're a cocktail bar with a very good menu and selection of drinks. Of course he had a few drinks. I don't drink alcohol, however, they were more than willing and friendly about making me an imaginative virgin cocktail. I am not picky, therefore, I left the creativity in the hands of the bartender. It was mostly citrus based.

And just in a very bad mood for a fun place like this bar. As long as u dont run into the manager u ll have an amazing time here :)",2018-06-07T21:16:20Z,34

300,Hello Goodbye,3.7,"We were dealing with MICKY VALENS and hes a rookie promoter. I will NEVER go to Hello Goodbye again because of the way we were treated and since he cant prortize his reservations. I reserved a vip booth for 3 bottles for my sisters birthday. When we got there it took us forever to get in the club cause they were ""overwhelmed"" with the amount of people who showed up at the same time for bottle service. When we FINALLY got inside MICKY gave us a table that seats 4-5 people.. there were 10 of us lol. He said that people stand around anyways but hows that his decision to make? I then stated we should all fit COMFORTABLY and he obviously had nothing to say. I told him we had a reservation for the VIP BOOTH and he said he couldnt accommodate us due to ALL the booths being sold out since we showed up later. In our emails he told me to come ""12:30 latest"" it was 11:30 when we showed up. Anyone would think they have untill 12:30 to show up and after that our booth would be given away which is fair. When i confronted him, he was super rude and not willing to accommodate us. When i asked him why he couldnt have let me know the vip booth that i RESERVED was sold out he looked at me threw his hands up and said no i couldnt and shruged his shoulders. How does that make sense? When i said were not going to stay he said okay , threw his hand in my face and said you can leave and walked away. We obviously left and spent our money else where. We went to cabana for bottle service and had alot of fun and they even threw in bottles of champagne/shots after we told them what happened at this wack bar. So i owe it to MICKY for messing up since we had a way better time at cabana. Take my advice and never ever deal with this guy, he has no idea what hes doing. And if you do, be there before the club opens because you wont be guaranteed your reservation.",2019-09-30T23:37:06Z,34
301,Hello Goodbye,3.7,"Was on a day trip to Vancouver for work and wanted to get some drinks and do some people watching.  Drove around for about 30min looking and could not find anything so that's when I decided to get some assistance online.  Found the door and the hostess walked us down.

When we showed up to the hidden door (that was propped open) through the brick wall, there was a small lineup outside.  We were greeted by a man who was friendly and well dressed.  There was a 10-15min wait as he said they were having capacity issues.

My friends and I each ordered something different off the cocktail menu.  The server was very knowledgeable about the cocktails and tried to cater to what we liked.  There was a DJ and the music was good, a lot of 90's R&B, indie and hip hop.  The crowd was cool but then it got really busy after midnight.  I recommend going earlier.

Otherwise, bouncer will tell you to come back between 15mins-1hr on a Friday night (~930pm). When we came back after 15 mins, they said only 4 out of 7 in our group can come in because of overcapacity, so when 3 of my friends decided to just leave, they let 4 of us in and at the same time, 4 other people who just lined up were able to enter.

He did nothing to stop the problem, just kept pretending it wasn't his fault. He was rude and forceful with the customers. He needs to be fired In my opinion as he obviously has no experience.

The bathrooms were clean. The DJ booth had padding up front so it's very comfortable to hold on to and the lights streaming across the ceiling and down the walls looked awesome. It got pretty packed inside but nobody was pushing into me or knocking me around, was still bumping at 2am. Would give 5 stars if they had just a little more space :)

We went on a Friday and knew that it would be dead but wanted to check it out anyway. Well, cover was $15 and we went in around 11:30pm. Maybe 5 people were there and the dance floor was empty. We left and came back at 1:30, still dead.

The 1* is just to indicate that it's not really a happening place right now probably because it just opened a month ago. Hopefully they get a good crowd going soon.

Here are a couple of price breakdowns:
Cover on a Saturday night was $25
Coat-check was mandatory and cost $4
Service charge on their ATM was $4
A bottle of ""cheap beer"" was $7

Immediately after entering this glorified rat maze, I was hit by a thick wall of humidity and body odour. The club was tiny, unventilated and there were so many people packed in that it was virtually impossible to dance, or even move from one end to the other.
The bar service was atrocious and the drinks were overpriced.
I walked through a flooded corridor to get to the exceptionally filthy washrooms.
This place takes the cake for the worst club I've been to in Vancouver.
If you're absolutely dead-set on visiting a scuzzy club, you're better off with The Roxy. At least they provide some decent service and they don't try to pass themselves off as something they are not.

I won't be returning here, and I will do everything in my power to education others in the hope that they won't make the same mistake I did. I will also be filing a formal report to City Hall concerning their blatant disregard for the establishment occupancy limits.

It's all gone now... 
Enter MIA - at your own risk that is:
side entrance with old incorrectly spaced stairs; long slim entry that's cramped with turns and too much like a house of mirrors (I wondered if they had a camera set up to laugh at wasted people walking into the glass.  Then later witnessed someone do just that); the bar on the wrong side of the room (who wants to maneuver a crowd to get a beverage?); the cave looked cool but would have been cooler if it was behind the dj booth; cramped vip spaces; the lighting effect on the ceiling is interesting, yet when you look at it you get blinded by LED spots,
no airflow which isn't surprising with the lack of flow through out the space; sound system was sweet but I couldn't wait to leave.

322,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"had such a good time... UNTIL I went outside to cool off

so my friend and I got here around 1030 and spent a couple hours dancing and drinking. I think I spent around $90 on drinks. After being on stage and dancing and getting very sweaty for about 8 songs we went outside to cool off. This was when my problems started.

My stamp, unfortunately, rubbed off. I was VERY sweaty. Dancing does that to you, weirdly.. I also washed my hands twice since I arrived. sometimes when you drink you have to pee. WILD.

Anyways...When I tried to go back inside, they told me I wasn't allowed in and I would have to wait in the line and pay cover again. He told me that the stamps didn't wash off, ever (somehow). Like this was some sort of actual tattoo and not just... A stamp. I explained that I just came outside to cool off. Didn't help. I showed them credit card charges totaling $90 from the night. Didn't help. He asked the woman who let me in. she confirmed she recognized me. ALSO DIDNT HELP. I felt like I was in the twilight zone. The most insane part was I walked by BOTH said bouncers to go outside. I wasn't being sneaky. I wasn't hiding anything. Just trying to cool off and then hopefully spend $50-$100 more there before calling it a night. I was ready to let loose!

anyways, the bouncers made sure to berate and belittle me in front of a crowd of people and it was really embarrassing!! After spending over a hundred bucks there it was the biggest slap in the face. I have never been treated like that in my life. I came with the best intentions and was treated like a crook. just crazy.

I hope the two guys at the door enjoy their power trip. I will be contacting mgmt in addition to this review because this entire experience was absolutely absurd.

325,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"It's been a while since I have ripped it up in a night club and the Fox Cabaret was a very entertaining surprise. The Fox is located in Mount Pleasant on Main St. near 7th ave, in an old movie theater. The projection room has been transformed into the dance floor! 

It's a long and narrow building with two levels. Upstairs you will find a balcony with a great view of all the party goers below, a second bar and some cosy spots to get your chill on. Next door is another smaller room called the Cabaret room, and of course the main room downstairs, The Projection room. The Projection room has tables and bench seating which is great, because I often want to sit, drink and people watch, as well as a large bar, and small dance floor.

Overall it is a more intimate venue and rather unique! I love that they maintained some of the Cinema decor and made it work as a bar/club. They have weekly events with live bands and performers, such as Wednesday night stand up comedy and Sunday night improve. Of course Thursday, Friday and Saturday's are your nights to shake your booty with different DJs or live bands. 

We visited for a friends birthday, and although I may have already had my fair share of drinks, I was quite pleased with a few factors with this venue. The first, we did not have to wait in line! It was a Saturday night at about 12:30. Super huge plus because I have little patience for line ups. Next, the cover was $12, which is probably pretty standard these days, but my opinion is there should be a live band or DJ to warrant that fee. The DJ was fantastic!!! Worth every penny. I had one drink and had to hit the floor! I don't know who he/she was but it was epic!! ‍

They have drink specials   which are prepared by easygoing bartenders, but.....I am taking a star away for the fact that they only accept cash.  There is a bank machine which charges you $3, plus your bank will charge on top of that. It's 2018, time to up your game with portable debit machines!! Honestly, they would only make more money and inconvenience patrons less. Also, the ladies bathroom was a bit on the small side.",2018-04-12T01:08:59Z,46

There is a stage in the venue, a bar area and bar high top tables at the back. 

Inside is a bit run down and can be sticky due to the sticky beer spill. Yes the place does have a strong beer smell. The chairs up front are temporary chairs not theater style. 

Guess venue can be use for multi-purpose.",2018-05-07T06:04:15Z,46

329,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"Spontaneously decided to hit up The Fox last night! After enjoying a Christmas dinner we just googled events that were happening and it was #Bossy night, which meant femme powered hip hop and r&b. YEAAAH sign me up !!! 

It's honestly so hard to find good decent hip hop events in Vancouver. I was pleasantly surprised because we didn't have to wait long in line at all and there were hardly any line ups at the bar. We were able to grab a table and sit down to chill in between dancing. It was such a better and refreshing vibe compared to some of the ratchet clubs downtown. I like how the crowd was a diverse mix of people and you could literally walk in wearing whatever you feel comfortable in -- there were a lot of people wearing Christmas sweaters which I thought was rather cute ! 

Music was a lot better in the beginning of the night . the djs switched half way thru and then it got really weird around 1245 so we left. The 2nd DJ completely strayed from the hip hop theme--didn't bother to read the crowd and just seem to play whatever he wanted. If the first DJ stayed on for longer, we would have too ! 

PS the $5 shooters were pretty tasty. If you bring cash there's a convenient little bar on the side where you can get them. We got 2 rounds of the ""crouching tiger"" which had a nice refreshing lychee flavour !",2017-12-17T20:34:39Z,46

I would say 19-30ish but mostly early 20's, when I went.The club in small but looks cool. 
My drink was over priced and unusually small. There was no where to sit. The music was fun but a bit predictable. Those who where there seemed to be having a good time dancing. Mostly people in their early 20's. So if you only want to dance it's a good place for that.",2018-06-01T19:59:42Z,46
331,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"This might not be the classiest or best laid-out venue in the city, but it totally works for what they do. Just inside the entrance there are tables with bench seating and stools. Along the right side is the bar, with another smaller bar occasionally open on the balcony - oh, and they have a balcony. Also upstairs are the bathrooms, which have always been fairly clean.

The staff have always been friendly and chill. There's usually a drink special, often on group-oriented stuff like pitchers or buckets of particular bottles. They also usually have self-serve water jugs out so you don't have to feel like a jerk for asking the bartender for water.

Its location is also super convenient: it's literally a 1 minute walk from 5 bus lines, including an B-Line (express) and 3 Night Buses. Around it are several decent food options (several vegetarian friendly), and a few locations good for pre-gaming or post-event hangin' out. (There is even a second smaller bar/club inside the building upstairs, if you enjoy hipster stuff.)

I've only been here for comedy shows (like their regular improv show, ""Sunday Service"") and concerts, but it works well for both.",2017-07-12T00:54:09Z,46

333,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"I am a huge fan of more venues of this kind popping up.  Vancouver needs more places to DO things and I am always keen to see a place bring foot traffic to an area at night (even better if it is a stretch where it doesn't disturb apartments or houses).  I cannot think of a place more suited for a venue, 

Everyone seems to know the history of this place,.. it was an Indian porn theatre for decades and seems a miracle to me that it wasn't torn down.  And it is a good thing, the bones of it are perfect for a sustainable sized venue not on the disgusting Granville downtown douche-bag row.

I think the reno was ok, though it is a bit dark in there, but I love that they kept the sign form the outside and used it as a feature inside. One minor complaint is that the venue is a long, narrow chute,.. and table layout might have been better, but that is getting picky.  There is also this crazy louge upstairs! Vancouver's best kept secret!  I highly recommend taking a look at that and the balcony, both allowing for special events and making this a true ""multi-purpose"" venue.

Not to end on a low note, but my biggest beef about this place is the same as what it would have been for the Waldorf: programming.  We went for Nerd Nite, maybe not the best venue for that kind of quiet event, but the usual programming historically has not been for me, I hate DJs. and prefer real musicians.  I like to be able to socialize when I go out to socialize meaning being able to hear (I guess I'm older than the demographic they are aiming for).  They do however have a regular improv group on Sunday Night that is touted as one of Vancouver's best featuring comedian Ryan Biel,.. I'm coming back for that!

336,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"Went here on a friday night for a friend's birthday. There was motown event and some bands that were playing. We were on guestlist for free entry into the motown event which was only  valid from 10:30pm-11pm. Unfortunately we didn't know this beforehand and got there an hour early, so we decided to pay the $10 cover to get in. 

Based on what my friend said, the history of Fox Cabaret is kinda funky, apparently it used to be a porn theatre in the past so that was a little off putting for me at first since I was hesitant about the sanitation of the place haha. But as with most bars and clubs, it's pretty questionable anyways so I got over that fact. 

The vibes in the place were pretty hipster with chalkboard drink menus on the walls, a disco ball, a stage for the bands, a light-up sign behind the 1st floor bar, and tons of high tables & chairs. The 1st floor had the motown music going on while there was also a 2nd floor balcony area and a smaller room where they played hip-hop and dancehall instead. 

DISCLAIMER: I have experienced the clubbing scene in Toronto numerous times so I may have different standards. So here are my honest opinions...

DRINK & FOOD - There were $6 drink specials and the rest ranged from $7-$9. Their high-balls felt very watered down and their tequila shots had no salt available. I believe the 2nd floor room can be used for private events and that night there was a birthday party there so there was cake and various platter foods on the 2nd floor. Everyone was welcoming there to us party crashers so that was fun! There's 2 bars on the 2nd floor and the main bar is on the 1st floor. Bartenders were polite and quick, and the self-served water at each bar was much appreciated!
MUSIC - The motown line-up was pretty cool, not my personal cup of tea, but the songs meshed well together and everyone was having a good time. The 2nd floor hip-hop/dancehall DJs were terrible in my opinion. Repeated songs, no song requests, and horrible transitions.
VENUE - pretty grungy but hip at the same time! The 2nd floor room can get pretty hot but the balcony outside of it is a great place for a breather and there's tons of seats/couches available. The crowd is definitely more on the mature and older side as well.

I still had tons of fun since I was with my friends, but I wouldn't recommend Fox Cabaret as the best clubbing spot for someone especially in their early 20's.",2017-04-29T21:25:13Z,46

You know that old porno theatre on Main Street that used to lend the area a super scuzzy vibe? Well, the folks that used to be behind the Waldorf (when it was cool) have totally revamped it and made it into an arts and entertainment venue. And it's a pretty sweet one at that. Inside, there's a theme of black and red that runs throughout, and with its dim lighting, balcony seats and long bar, it makes for a swanky-yet-hip place to hang out. They have a decent cocktail/beer/wine menu, and they even have some pretty delicious-looking popcorn options if you're feeling munchy.

As far as entertainment goes, they seem to host a number of small bands, and the Ice Cream Social that used to be at the Biltmore has now moved to the Fox. (Free floats before 10!) What brought me to the Fox Cabaret is the Sunday Service, who host their weekly improv show at 9pm on Sunday nights (which, incidentally, is the same time as Kitty Nights. Oh, the tough choices we must make!) If you make reservations ahead of time, show up before 8:15 to claim your table. There's a $10 minimum spend per person with a reservation, which as far as I'm concerned is a non-issue, but it's worth mentioning. I like how they have servers come around to the tables to help keep the good times rolling, which is nice when you're comfy and too lazy to worm your way to the bar.

Overall, the Fox Cabaret is a welcome new addition to Mount Pleasant's entertainment scene.

**Edit: I was wrong about the Ice Cream Social. The Biltmore still hosts it one Friday per month; the rest of the time it's at the Fox Cabaret.**",2014-06-08T19:30:40Z,46
341,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,I love the Fox! They have recently redone the sound and I was really impressed. It is a fantastic venue for intimate live shows or just a night out in general. Drinks are superb and the staff is on point. Leta knows how to shake 'em! Thanks for the great experience. Vancouver is lucky to have you!,2019-08-18T05:44:54Z,46
342,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"The Fox hosts some good acts, including some very interesting presentations, but it can be a really crammed and sometimes very hot place to visit, making it ideal only for people who want to imagine they've gone to see a show in the jungle, without the dangers of bugs or stalking jaguars.

If you're very tall and/or a giraffe, you'll have a better time at the Fox Cabaret, since you'll be sold a ticket even if there's not much room left and will likely have to share either standing space next to a noisy bar, or the very limited room on the hot, stuffy and distant balcony, straining to see and sweating like a rejected Juliet.

Get there early if you can. Or go with a friend who is some form of large creature that you can mount or perch upon.",2016-02-15T06:34:33Z,46
343,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"This review is not so much a reflection of the Venue, but the Halloween Event Oct 31, 2015.
Hands down the least talented DJ's in the city, they could not beat match if their lives depended on it. Every time the DJ tried to drop a beat, our group of 20+ people all looked at eachother and shook our heads. Cool Venue, but wow, whoever put together the night, needs a slap.",2015-11-02T17:45:02Z,46
344,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,Classic vaudeville theatre turned alt culture venue; great old school vibe and really friendly vibe. Recommend the Stage 3 geeky burlesque/music/merd trivia shows.,2017-08-20T01:17:10Z,46
345,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"I came to the Fox a few weeks ago for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night.

The event was called ""Love"", and I have to say the atmosphere was extremely positive, energetic, and absolutely FUN.

I've come back to the Fox on Friday and Saturday nights and will continue to do so simply because of the atmosphere and people. Definitely a go-to spot for a fun night out with friends or just to meet some super cool new people!",2016-03-30T05:30:08Z,46
346,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"I went here with a friend and I had the best time! I had a chance at enjoying the 70s retro fun night and I am blown away by our talented Vancouver dancers and peeps just enjoying night life and being super friendly. 

The entry is not terribly priced and the DJ is super competent, and the drinks are not outrageously priced. All in all, the most fun night I've had in a while. 

I am hoping to become a regular.",2018-08-20T18:59:07Z,46
347,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"Boyfriend and I visited The Fox on Friday to see The Barr Brothers play live, and it was such a great experience!

The venue is intimate, but big enough that there's a good atmosphere in the crowd. We arrived fairly early and snagged a prime spot in front of the sound booth. There's a shelf thoughtfully placed all around it so you can rest your drink there to avoid cold hands and/or awkward clapping accidents!

The drink specials are written on small chalkboards right by the register so it's super easy to see what deals they have. Our two double gin and tonics were around $17, which isn't too bad at all! The bartenders were friendly and the bussing staff were SO efficient; I think the guy made 4 rounds before the opening act had even finished!

The sound quality is good, the space is large but homey, and I really think this place is due to be a Main St staple! Highly recommended!",2014-12-08T20:34:54Z,46
348,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,I saw a show here last night. World class band only 20 bucks. They have a great drink selection including very impressive non-alcoholic beverages. I had the lemon rose water infused cocktail. Great music and great service. Tip the bartenders well they are working hard and they are making excellent drinks with care and attention to detail. It felt like a special night out I will be back.,2018-04-02T00:13:40Z,46
349,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"The Fox Cabaret has been beautifully redone. Primary colours adorn each wall for a bright, vibrant, and funky look on the interior. There is a patio/viewing area for those who prefer some exclusivity/quiet in the club, but the last few times I've been here it has not been open to the public.

Their weekly Ice Cream Social is a lot of fun too. It's a continuation of Tyler Fedchuk's event that was first at Shine, and then at the Biltmore Cabaret. If you're a fan of 50's pop and 60's garage rock you'll enjoy their free event.

Great job on the venue Arrival! Hopefully you won't be haunted by the ghosts of perverts past.",2014-08-18T21:24:23Z,46
350,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"As a performer and patron, this is my favourite entertainment venue in Vancouver. 

Performers
Pros: The stage is of great quailty, well-manicured and quite large. Great sound system and lighting. 

Con: Small // minimal dressing room and changing space. We found it quite tricky for a show we did with several costume changes. 

Patrons 
Pros: Interesting, edgy and unique entertainment. The Ice Cream Social is a must-do night out. Great atmosphere and bar. 

Cons: This is a new venue and is still getting the name out. Some nights are less busy than others (which can be a pro as well). 

I have a feeling Fox Cabaret will explode shortly as an entertainment venue on not just Main Street, but for the downtown Vancouver arts crowd.",2014-08-18T05:32:18Z,46
351,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,Watered down drinks at this place? I ordered and paid for 5 x double cocktails and a beer which came out to like $70 + tip during a 2 hr concert and barely had a buzz at the end. Tiny stage and mediocre sound. Save your money and go to the commodore or an edm show @ harbour instead.,2018-10-30T11:24:31Z,46
352,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"I went to the Fox Cabaret yesterday, and was not happy. the place was overbooked, and were standing at the back and could not here a thing. The place did not have any food, only drinks and not cheap either (low quality cocktails, and beers). If you do decide to go there you need to come early and reserve a seat at the front. Overall I would not recommend that place.",2016-05-16T21:25:39Z,46
353,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"Favourite spot on Main Street for cocktails, great bartender Mark upstairs in the Projection room. The Fox seems to have solid bands in the early night and an impeccable dance party theme for the later part of the night. Will always be my go-to club.",2016-08-22T08:01:03Z,46
354,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"Not impressed! Went for the Non-Stop Disco Party which advertised music by Donna Summer, Pointer Sisters, Sister Sledge, etc. - the hit performers from the 70's - but the DJ only played tunes from today, with some remixes. Nothing from the 70's! What was he thinking?? My friends and I were disappointed as we expected an authentic disco night. We would have been happy with current tunes mixed in, but there was not one original song played. I even asked the DJ to play some original tunes, and his reply was rude and dismissive. I do admit that the beat of songs played was good for dancing and so we did have fun, but it was definitely not what was advertised.",2018-09-01T19:52:34Z,46
355,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"I really like the mix of live music and DJs and old school themes and that you don't have to go downtown to find a place to dance... BUT the service is awful. We ordered a few over priced beers and had literally taken the first sips when we decided to jump on the dance floor. After dancing to a couple songs we returned to find our drinks gone! When I told the bartender she was less than polite and with a bored snear said ""that's our rule, you can't leave drinks unattended"". !!!?? Ok I'm not sure if this is a new club rule but I had never heard it! She said we needed to ask the bar to watch them if we wanted to dance... so I said we didn't know and with that being a huge possibility for anyone that had left full drinks, had they been put behind the bar... no of course not. Anyways my friend was more upset than I and asked to speak to the manager and the bartender very rudely said ""you are not talking to anyone"" then walked away!! We are not kids and we were not drunk and the way we were treated was completely unacceptable. They then sent the bouncer over to ask us to leave!!! I have being going out dancing for 30 years and this was a first.   Be aware that costumer service is not a priority at this place.",2018-11-19T23:10:55Z,46
356,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"I am not above it all to openly say that I have been here during two phases of this place, this being of course better. It still has a bit of the Fox Theater charm, however, now it is a really small music venue in which I have seen limited shows. It is not 100% designed as a music venue and the few concerts I have been to have sound issues of their own. Compared to the Rickshaw this is still a step up. Very narrow hallway on the main floor so it gets weirdly packed. Punk shows get questionable with this layout. Great stuff.",2015-10-30T18:28:47Z,46
357,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"Great new spot in Vancouver for small bands coming through the city. The place isn't perfect (was smoking hot in the summer) but was fine for a November show. But the acoustics are good, it's an intimate setting, and never been disappointed leaving at the end of the night.",2017-11-21T19:09:27Z,46
358,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"Not only is Fox Cabaret a beautiful and unique venue, they are managed by professional, courteous staff.

My partner is a comedian, and it's often difficult for me to attend shows because I broke my back recently, and have a very hard time sitting in normal seats.

I emailed Fox Cabaret via their website, and heard back within a few hours from both the General Manager, Chris Hesje, and Daniel Fazio of the Arrival Agency.

Even though the event I was inquiring about is wildly popular and sells out, they were more than happy to reserve a table that would be comfortable for me to enjoy the show from.  They also made sure the table would accommodate a few friends, as well...

Thank you, Fox Cabaret, for being one of Vancouver's few really hip AND accessible venues.",2015-06-19T17:11:48Z,46

360,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"Not a great place for live music. Also super frustrating waiting in line while the bartender does shots with her friends.

361,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"This place is good as a bar, but not so great to see live music.

363,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"Love this place! 

Came here for a Yelp event, and knowing the seedy history of this place I couldn't help but struggle to swallow some feelings of apprehension. 

The room itself is a great size, small enough to be intimate but large enough to not feel too cramped. The high ceilings really open the space up. 

Part of the event included a Burlesque show accompanied by a live band, and although the stage looked small, they had no problems doing their thing. Sound was good. 

This place really prides itself on being a community venue, they host private events, live music, art showings, movies, ect. It's about time a place like this popped up on Main. I'll definitely be back.",2014-08-28T21:15:27Z,46
364,The Fox Cabaret,3.2,"Good venue but poorly run.  The layout is poorly thought out too, esp. for shows. There's ""standing room"" between the seating are and the stage.  I've been to Sunday Service twice now and ended up just watching the back of the heads of the crowd between the tables and the stage.  Room is overcrowded.  Draft beer has been warm and flat both times.  Bartenders are really nice and really inexperienced.

366,Gossip Nightclub,1.8,"I had the ultimate disappointment of getting dragged to this god awful club last night for a brostep (dubstep) show. I have been a dj in Toronto when this music was good and now its turned into a complete crap genre. 

I wasn't trying to have a bad time, in fact I came out with the intention of having a great time. 

First- 1.5 hours to get in 

Second- Asshole security (re:power trippers) 

Third- Headliner didn't show up, so this other dj played the whole time, 3 hours or so. He couldn't mix to save his life, just scratched and dropped tracks. Every tune sounded the same. 

Fourth- I felt like I was at an under age event. The people looked like they were 12. I literally found a rattle on the floor. 

I could go on but the reality is I am perhaps to old to wait in lines and pay 8 dollars for a beer and listen to shit music surrounded by tweens dressed in costumes (oh wait this is how the usually dress) hoped up on mdma giving each other light shows with glow gloves. 

Won't be returning.",2011-10-31T22:33:07Z,13

A lot of eye candy. If you like scantily clad Asian women this is the spot.

368,Gossip Nightclub,1.8,"Wow... I think this place tries to cater to everyone. The venue is/has/was been used and abused... The first thing you'll notice is how your feet will stick to the floor.  Coat check was $6. Expensive drinks, Cash only bars.

The girl bartenders waste booze (by trying to be fast and spilling), so go to a fella - I really appreciated how #71 was very careful and considerate of my $7.75 drink.  We're not sure if the booze was watered down.

The sound system is OK - the light show and projection are, at best, a half-attempt to amuse and entertain you.  No In and Out privileges - as in they are too lazy / cheap to do wristbands or stamps.

I would assume the place is Asian owned as it was staffed by 90% Asians. Merely stating an observation.  Most of them are as warm and friendly as an ice cube.",2012-11-13T05:04:57Z,13

If it wasn't for the resident drug dealers in the washroom or the bouncers threatening to kill a guy for waving at the slow bartenders...it was ok.

Pros: Awesome ambiance, one of the best disco lighting, very spacious. There are floors where you can dance. The bars are located at convenient spots so that access is comfy. For all these reasons I'm sparing two stars!

Cons: Horribly high priced! The entry cover was $30 when I went; but the performances were friggin boring. I would never even bare that torture even for free! The drinks are small and ridiculously over priced. The day I went was supposed to Bollywood music nite. It was nothing but some crappy Panjabi music. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate panjabi music like Honey Singh, IMran khan, etc. But they played some crappy panjabi songs over and over for three and half hours after which I felt like killing myself.

Even the Asian girl with the drawn on eyebrows who works at the coat check counter has a horrible attitude and seems very unhappy with her life and her job.

Sadly most of these places were replaced by shitty chain stores like Old Navy and Urban Outfitters. Could you get more boring? 
I still love Granville Street though. Luckily there are some places left that weren't touched, and retain their original character. Some of my favourites are the Commodore Bowling Lanes, Harbour Dance Studio, The Templeton Diner, Movieland Arcade and The Vogue. 
The nightclubs on this strip are pretty monotonous however, so unless you're into top 40 you'll have to venture out into different areas of the city.

There's still a few cool places around here if you're downtown anyway, however, not a place/street that I would go out of my way to hang out at.

Attention Vancouver club owners. CHILL on the bottle service. In fact, axe it. If we are gonna have any hope at good nightlife, you need to cater to the everyday crowd. Not the people in Lambos, making it rain in strip clubs who don't come to your crappy bar in the first place.

Parking isn't really available here.  Granville becomes a tow-away zone at night.

Based on the theme, I'm guessing it's supposed to be something along the lines of tropical and Caribbean.  The place does look a bit like that with the cloth canopies.  However, there's also a Buddha statue at the back bar.  Wrong part of the world.

There are also 2 bars at the front, which helps spread the crowds out.  The music wasn't too loud so it was possible to have a conversation.  Drinks were somewhat reasonable.",2017-09-18T01:44:14Z,21

And you can TRUST MY REVIEW...

bc I don't only have 5 reviews that are all 5 stars?? Questionable. Did someone get paid to do their review? Using the clubs website photo? Lol!! 

The worst service ever!! Except the coat room girls. You girls were awesome.

I asked the bartender to give me a 3 vodka slimes...he gives me 3 vodka limes. I tell him...he just gives me another vodka lime. Wtf?? And he was really rude and arrogant about it. Moron.

But the worst of all was the service outside. I don't know if it was the club staff or promoter...but they kept us waiting outside EVEN THOUGH we bought tickets ahead of time for NYE. Who does that??? What a bunch of typical Vancouver losers.

Also, when they tried to speed up entry BC IT WAS 11:40 Pm (when there shouldn't even be a line!!) They start letting ppl from the back in first...screwing over the ppl in the middle. Jerks!

Disappointed by that place. Wont go again.",2016-01-15T04:50:50Z,21
391,Cabana Lounge,2.4,"This place is ok overall.

The drink prices were high especially with the strict law on how much they can pour, expect to get exactly one ounce of hard alcohol. It would have been nice to be told or have the option for bottle service as we found out only while we were leaving that this venue had very reasonable bottle prices and options.

The bar is actually a bit rude as another reviewer (Sukh) put it. But when I realized this, I just made my female friends start ordering at the bar for all of us. The male bartenders seem to be more responsive to tall white girls rather than short Asian men as king for drinks. (typical at most clubs)

The music was considerate on noise level and not too much treble. We all were thankful of that the next day not having a ring to our ears. We stayed a while and all my friends had a great time.",2015-03-17T22:47:14Z,21

In disbelief, I turned around and saw that it was a caucasian female, roughly 5'3,"" wearing a stripy bandana and some sort of bandage on her chest while wearing a ""Cabana lounge"" T-shirt. I am used to the atmosphere of clubs, and being shoved is something that occurs often, but this woman I saw from the corner of my eye used so much force that I almost fell down in my group of friends when I was not even remotely in her way. As I turned around to speak to her about this inappropriate act, she invaded my personal space and started yelling aggressively at me. This behaviour, especially by a staff member, was truly disrespectful, unprofessional, and unbecoming of a representative of an establishment such as this.",2016-03-07T06:39:31Z,21
395,Cabana Lounge,2.4,"First, I want to say clubs are not my cup of tea at all.  I hate going to douchy dance scenes where guys act like a-holes because all they do is GTL.

This club was a little different,  they played good music and I did not get the douche vibe. One guy kept touching one of the girls in our group ass a few time, she told him to stop or I 'll kick you, and he said sorry and moved on. There is a cover charge no matter the sex.  I am use to only guys paying, so that to me was weird.  

I did not buy any drinks that night, people in my group did so,  I have no idea what that cost.  The bottle service looked reasonable.  Probably should of gotten on that.  People say the service is rude, I don't know, I mean the bouncer I talked to was cool, the bottle service lady was okay, the only thing I would say is the front door area are not super friendly, but I am guessing they deal with a lot of dumb people.",2015-03-18T02:30:55Z,21

397,Cabana Lounge,2.4,Cabana was a blast. Beautifully designed in a Miami style this adult lounge had so much energy and great vibes. The room features a huge tree in the center of the room that everyone gathers around. The outer walls of the venue are booths. Great music and great service from the friendly bartenders. This is a 25 and over venue with a strict dress code so the crowd was fantastic. This is not a place for kids but for adults. Thank you for an amazing night!,2015-01-06T01:09:33Z,21
398,Cabana Lounge,2.4,"I would not recommend this place to anybody, especially for how they treated my friends and I on my birthday.

We had a bottle service reservation for 8 and a guest list for 15 to this place. We made sure we were there by 10:30-11pm as we know line ups start to build. I had two friends that arrived earlier, but they were part of the bottle service group, so they got to go inside first. 

When i arrived with my gang, there was no line up. I approached the door lady to let her know my group was here. She said that the only way your group could get in is to all do bottle service. I mentioned that this is not our arrangement and had emailed proof of our confirmation. Her excuse was the club was full. I called my two friends inside to let me know the condition and they said that they had maybe 30-40 ppl max in there. I confronted the door lady to the matter and she said that we are at capacity for walk in. I told them that this was guest list. She said, they can wait in line and as people leave, they can see what they can do to shuffle them in. I said, no problem, since we are going to be first in line, we'll just wait.  I decided to wait in line with my friends. She confronted me and ask what i was doing? I said, i'm going to enter the club when you let my friends in. They came to celebrate with me, why would i leave them out here by themselves. I don't mind chatting with them in line. She then continually pressed on about (it was borderline forcing us)  to pay $100/each for bottle service to get in. I told her that i have some friends that don't drink, but they were willing to pay the entrance fee of $20/head to walk in. She then changed her tone and said, they won't get in. 

It was starting to get ridiculous. We decided to leave and celebrate my birthday at a different venue. This venue did not cater to make people happy but themselves. this was a very disappointing experience for me as we had this planned weeks in advance..

I would never go here nor recommend anyone to go here.",2015-03-20T01:09:16Z,21

400,Cabana Lounge,2.4,"I have been to this club 2 times. The first time I thought it was great. I liked it so much I wanted to return with my friends for my birthday party this past weekend. I emailed the club to see if I could get 16 people on the guest list. My email was answered promptly (by the owner of the club) stating that my guests were on the list and that the ""guest list is good for free cover and no line before 11:30 PM."" On the day of, I emailed again asking if I could increase my guest list by a couple of people. The owner again responded very quickly saying that it was no problem to add a few people and again reminded me that  ""the guest list is good for free cover and no line before 11:30 PM."" Later that night my friends and I showed up at Cabana at approximately 11:15. After approaching the bouncer and letting him know that I had a group of people on the guest list, he directed me to get in a large line of people that didn't seem to be moving quickly at all. I showed the bouncer my email which included that there would be no line and he said regardless we had to line up. We then went and stood in a none moving line and upon trying to talk the bouncer again, he stated that if you are not in the bar before 11:30 PM you would have to pay the 20 dollar cover charge. I asked to speak to a manager/owner, but no one ever came. We continued standing in the line until 11:50 and they had only let 2 people in out of a huge line. My friend asked the bouncer how long the line would be and he said a half hour minimum. Since we were guaranteed no line and didn't seem to be getting anything we were promised, we decided to leave. By that time it was too late to get into any reputable place. I am very disappointed I trusted this place as the location for my birthday. DO NOT GUEST LIST AT CABANA.",2017-11-20T21:30:18Z,21

405,Blarney Stone,3.2,"Had a blast when I came with some friends on a Friday night!

We wanted a place that was casual but still had dancing, and Blarney Stone fit the bill perfect.

My party of 10 or so arrived 11:30 pm on Friday night, and there was a short line to get in. We waited maybe 10 minutes before it was our turn. There was a $12 pp cash cover.

There was a live band on when we arrived and a large group of folks dancing in front, but we went and snagged a corner table first. There were plenty of open tables available, which surprised me, but I guess everyone was too busy dancing and having fun on the dance floor to sit :)

While we were enjoying the live band, I got a rum and coke from the bar for $8, which I thought was very affordable.

By midnight, the live band took a break and they started blasting top 40s mashups, which was right up my alley. We went and danced for a bit until the live band came back on around 12:40, and then chilled for a bit until the mashups started again around 2:15. 

Overall we had a blast dancing here! When the time we left around 2:45, it was still hopping with plenty of people on the dance floor.

I'd definitely come back again next time I get the dancing itch.",2022-07-20T19:31:07Z,134

 I'm gonna say I'm a fan, based on the fact that I enjoy the live band (great if you want to listen to random jigs thrown in with some pop and rock), the service is friendly, and there is plenty of space to get off the dance floor for my left-footed friends. Not sure on the price (I'm never paying somehow) but my cheap buddies always want to hang here for the pitchers.

Yeah I'm 22, but I enjoy fun music, good beer, and a place that accomodates my party-friends and my chill-friends equally.

419,Blarney Stone,3.2,"Blarney Stone is a terrible joke of a drinking establishment. Honestly. If you want a place that commits highway robbery with its cover charges (a jokes concept for this kind of place in itself) and drink prices, then look no further. 

The bar itself has an atmosphere that can be described as consistently below par. The drink specials are lame shooters with barely any alcohol contained within, and their beer tastes consistently watery. But I suppose the weak drinks are consistent with the majority of its clientele and waitstaff, which generally made me feel like I had entered a timewarp back to high school, where all these washed up suburbanites and underagers still maintained some modicum of significance. 

The interior of the bar itself is a failed attempt at charm. I can see what they were going for with the wood everywhere, but this choice of material has only facilitated the soaking in of spilt beer, and as a result, everything in the place always smells like piss. It doesn't matter where you are. The bar. The washroom. The tables. The dance floor. Next to anyone in the place. PISS. on every surface.

And I would forgive this fact if Blarney were cheap and/or fun. But it's neither. Last time I went there was a man who looked 85 playing an accordion and a bunch of people doing a jig on stage. Maybe this is just some sort of caucasian ritual I don't understand, but forgive me if I don't find this to be appropriate drinking music. It was no fun. 

Nothing about this place is worthwhile. The waitstaff is also slow and not particularly friendly to make up for their general laziness and crappy bar.",2010-11-04T20:01:35Z,134
420,Blarney Stone,3.2,"Like the food, pub service is leagues off of anything you would find at any sit down establishment. Here expect lengthy waits; and pretty servers who wander the room with a hardness, acquired from nights spent dealing with drunken customers and advances not wanted. Though with the above in mind I would question the flirting for tips and short plaid, school girl skirts. Our server was cold and stone faced. She would multitask, talking our request then checking in on the table next to us, before proceeding to fulfill our request. As a result two glasses of water made its way to our table 10 minutes after the third request for them was made. 

Would I go back? - No. By chance I came back tonight, after 7 years of not even considering it. There was nothing present tonight to ever drive me to return. But I was intrigued at the Irish menu option and considered ordering authentic Irish dishes like their stews and ""colcannon"", a Irish staple made with mashed potatoes, kale, cream, and butter. But after the disasters in classic and easy pub fare, I am sure I would be have only been disappointed. Though in the greater scheme of things, if you have enough booze in you everything is and tastes great. Maybe that is the way to go. Drink drunk before you decide on what to order. 
Would I recommend it? No. The tap poured beers common to any pub or casual restaurant along the streets of Gastown. The wings were the worst I have ever had. And it was all below average at best. You would be better off picking up a six pack and a frozen dinner; and heading to your couch instead of a barstool here.",2013-06-07T07:27:25Z,134
421,Blarney Stone,3.2,"This if the fifth part in a five part evening.  Part four was The Irish Heather.

We walked out of The Heather and debated what to do.  At 2:20 I walked up to the door man and asked what it would take for me and my friends to get in (hinting that we would like to get past the line).  He asked what time it was, I told him, and he indicated to wait until 2:30 so we could avoid the cover.  We hung out on the street and watched the drama of a couple being ejected.  I laughed out loud, hard and maniacally as I normally do, at some bar star (at the Blarney of all places) threatening the Blarney staff that she has ""friends"" and knows ""cops"" that will make their lives ""difficult"".  She was mildly called a bitch by one staff member, and she complained to the manager.  I'm surprised she wasn't called worse, since I wouldn't have held back about how much of a c**t she was.  I talked to the doorman after she left and suggested he encounters about ten or so like her in an evening.  Turns out it was about eight that night.  He let us in a few minutes early without cover.

We walked in and immediately sat at the front bar.  It was great service in that we had two bartenders and one busser for us.  We ran into the manager from The Heather and had a drink with him.  We were served pretty much until 3:00.  The bartenders didn't have an issue with us sitting and enjoying our drinks after they turned the lights on.  However, a bouncer came by about 3:10 and gave us a ten minute warning.

As we were heading out, we asked another bouncer about where we could keep the party going.  He suggested a place on Granville.  We hopped in a cab and were served another couple of rounds. but I will be keeping it a secret for the time being.  I don't want to ruin it for those of us who know about the place.",2011-04-20T03:46:11Z,134
422,Blarney Stone,3.2,"Initial thoughts:
Bouncer is unnecessarily rude, bar tender judges drink choices outwardly (sure judge me behind my back, but don't mock my drink choices to my face please). Feeling old and tired, needs some freshening up. Perhaps get some Irish bands in with original material every now and then.

Food & servers: always pleasant! Actually quite a decent pub to visit for lunch or dinner, and servers have been friendly and good at their job. Chicken strips are bomb! Soggy fries though. 

Music: cover bands; not my fave but I get it for the type of establishment it is. They do a good job with the material, and I hope they are paid well!

Atmosphere: Fine, nothing bad to say here 

Overall: other than the servers, the employees here are rude and appear to hate their jobs. Could use to lower the cover (or remove) now that the dance floor does not exist (it's more of an extra loud pub than a club; the cover seems pointless). Have had the bar tender mock my drink choices, and those of my friends when purchasing  for them. Bouncer told me to ""get the fuck in line"" when I was asking a question. Overall just an unpleasant experience. Have had many a negative time with the people that frequent here, so it's possible it's just not for me.

I saw a woman pouring her beer into a water bottle, which she put into her purse before she left.  Hmmmm ...  

When she and the fella she was with left, I moved over to their table as it was on the patio.  Other than a couple people stopping to ask for spare change, it was a nice spot to be.

The burger itself was juicy and nicely seasoned but I found the bun to be a bit too soft and it kept disintegrating as I was trying to eat the burger.

However, the bartender there was able to inform me that this place had it on tap, and it was right around the corner.  So, I came here and yes, they did indeed have it on tap!   So, I had a beer and I ordered some Traditional Poutine.  Now, the only reason that I am not giving this place five stars is that Traditional Poutine is French Fries, Brown Gravy and Cheese Curds... that is all.  And that is how it is listed on their menu.  When it came out, it had all of these disgusting raw, green onions on top.  Normally, I try to ask, but whenever I've ordered Traditional Poutine in Canada before, they've always gotten it right.  They were nice enough to remake it without any issues, and when I got it, it was the best I've had.  So, note to the cooks, you don't need to garnish it unless some one asks for it.  It doesn't add anything to an already spectacular dish.  The staff was very nice and despite being an open air place, it was very clean.  I ended up having four more beers while I was there.

I went here for the first time on Friday and it was amazing.

My friend and I arrived there around 9 PM and we could already see the place was very lively. We went right up the doors and were greeted by the bouncers, who were so nice, funny and welcoming (also, I swear one of them looked exactly like Superman ). 

Once we were inside we went straight to the first bar we saw (closest one to the doors) and within a few minutes we had our first shots and a drink to carry around. We found a couple of seats near the dance floor and right away a server came up to us and asked if we wanted to look at their food menu. I was both surprised and overjoyed since we were actually getting kind of hungry so this was great timing. I also didn't know they served food so late here (kitchen closes at 11 PM)! I ordered the cajun chicken quesadilla with yam fries (their red pepper aioli is delicious) and my friend had the sliders with plain fries. Both meals were amazing and while we were eating a live band was just about to perform! 

The band, who are called The Sheets (I asked our server) played a bunch of mashups of popular songs and it was awesome! I was enjoying every minute of their performance along with my mouth watering quesadillas. 

We ended up having a few more drinks and danced the rest of the night. Overall, it was a wonderful night and amazing first time experience here. I'll definitely be back here soon! Especially for the band and quesadillas",2019-09-23T04:30:51Z,134
439,Blarney Stone,3.2,"Came here to get a beer.

Parking is available on the streets, but good luck trying to find a spot.

The interior is somewhat unique, with the mezzanine over the dance area.  The only other places that come to mind with such a setup are Tobey's on the Drive, or (to a lesser degree) the Alexander downtown.

Beers are not the cheapest here at $7 or so.  The glasses also seem a bit smaller than other establishments.

It must've been a college night when I was here, as the floor was packed with quite a few young 'uns.  They do have the whole lights thing going, so this could be a decent place to party down.  More importantly though, the dance floor is a fairly decent size.  If you don't want to dance, there is also another bar area near the entrance.",2013-12-20T02:49:10Z,134
440,Blarney Stone,3.2,"This is a review for early dinner and drinks.

Being a Vancouverite, this place has been around for ages. Until New Years Day, I had never been (purposely avoided).

We were headed to a hockey game and met up with some friends visiting from the UK. Being New Years Day not much was open. It was 4pm, so the spots that we're going to be open at 5pm for dinner were not a option. 

We stared out with a round of Caesars, which were delicious and come with about 4 toppings. For my main, I ordered the shepherds pie. The portion was massive and so good I ate it all! My boyfriend had the Guinness Pie and had the same comment. I was pleasantly surprised with the food. We had a few rounds of beer, a selection to meet all preferences. 

As we left the bar was filling up, not sure what the atmosphere would be like when it's packed. When were there it was super laid back, not too loud, and really comfy.",2016-01-10T04:48:43Z,134
441,Blarney Stone,3.2,"If your are not going to spend lots of money there don't even bother on going, people were rude at my friends and I for not ordering more (we ordered 3 pitchers of beer to begin), bunch of drunk people and rude staff. 
We moved to a bar area from a table because some people were leaving and we were about to order and sit there when the door guy say that we need to buy stuff if we wanted to sit, he pointed at the pitchers of water and said look how much water you drank what a waste of table, great way to attract costumers !!!",2018-12-14T05:01:53Z,134
442,Blarney Stone,3.2,"Walked and got my usual whiskey drink ... then saw they had Jameson pickeback shots, they were great;  the Trampled by Turtles started playing, then noticed they had 2 gingers, then the Gourds version of gin and juice came on, this place is alright with me",2017-09-15T21:53:50Z,134
443,Blarney Stone,3.2,"The BEST part of the Blarney Stone:
1). Live Music
2). All ages (19-70)

The WORST part of the Blarney Stone:
1). $12 cover
2). Service with extreme attitude 
3). Expensive
4). Crowded as f&@k!
5). Long wait for drinks
6). Muscle dudes with serious faces
7). Bouncers that think that they're gods gift
8). Coat check $6 (and the girl expects a tip)
9). All staff demeanour, ""yeah.. I'm cool.""

Visited last night. Sure, some water pipes burst.. the bar staff were panicking and under pressure. However, the dark haired lady bartender at the front was such a bitch! She made sure every customer (except her select favourites) knew how upset she was. I would have usually walked out, but we had already paid hundreds in cover charge, coat check and a first round of drinks.

I'll save my hard earned cash for a place that appreciates their patrons.

Unfortunately for humanity, university students and tourists will forever be fooled by this place.",2017-04-08T21:14:49Z,134
444,Blarney Stone,3.2,"We came here on a Saturday night, and had a good time. They had all of the hockey games on, even the non-local games. The bartender was really nice (tall guy with a beard and faux hawk), and he was very attentive. We never felt neglected even when the bar filled up. And let me tell you, it really filled up. 
There was a sort of Irish sort of not Irish band that went on at 9:30. They were not terrible, they certainly got the crowd dancing and put on a decent show. A lot of people sitting at the bar were clearly there to watch hockey and they turned the games off early because the band was going on, so that was a shame. 
The food was pretty standard bar food, with the star being the fried mac and cheese. Definitely better than the fried Mac and cheese I've had before. 
Overall, it was a fun place and we might come back if we are in the area.",2016-03-02T20:06:02Z,134
445,Blarney Stone,3.2,"I apologize for the snark that's about to ensue, because I really should have read the reviews before I came here, but my (much younger) coworker really wanted a place to mingle with ""cute Vancouver boys."" After leaving another Gastown bar feeling unimpressed, we thought an Irish pub would do the trick. 

This isn't an Irish pub. This is a noisy, cramped, and overpriced nightclub trying to parade as the real thing. We were first ""greeted"" by gruff bouncers who informed us about the $12 cover. ""It's for the live band,"" they said. The band played two songs while we were inside before leaving the stage for the night (I believe their closing number may have been a cover of Eagle-Eye Cherry, if that gives you any sense of the place). What a ripoff. Your cover charge isn't to offset the price of the band if you're charging people after the band leaves the stage (which they were). 

When we made our way to the bar, my coworker ordered a rum and Coke and I just ordered a Diet Coke. It took about three times for the brunette bartender to understand that I just wanted a Diet Coke, no booze. I'm sorry that I'm not ordering a high-priced drink, but I don't need sass about it. Designated drivers are a thing, and by the looks of this place on a Friday night, many of the young blokes had already been over-served. 

If you're 19 and new to drinking, or you're a young tourist looking for a ""real taste of the big city,"" I'm sure this place would be a highlight of your night.",2017-11-13T02:55:59Z,134
446,Blarney Stone,3.2,"Friends wanted to come here. I am not sure where to start! 4 of us walked in... I was the only one who didn't order drink. But, I assumed I would get a glass of water, but I didn't. When the staff came over set up the table, everyone got extra napkin but me. That said, I didn't get a good service at beginning. Oh well... what can you do? People have bad days sometimes. I thought maybe my food would make up with the bad service. Oh my no! I got the O'Benedicts with avocado and the eggs were totally over cooked. It wasn't even busy when we went! I just felt so disappointed. I am normally a great tipper. But, this is the first time I did not tip. Sorry but not sorry!",2016-10-25T21:21:29Z,134
447,Blarney Stone,3.2,"If I had an option to give them zero, I would.
Terrible food and service.
We were there for a birthday, and birthday boy received 3 bottles of alcohol, they said that we are not allowed to keep it in the bar and offered to store it for us. At the end of our dinner the said that they actually confiscated the alcohol, and that it was destroyed. What a joke. Do not go there terrible place.",2017-07-12T02:55:14Z,134
448,Blarney Stone,3.2,Not a bad place to spend your Saturday night. Typical Irish pub crowd bopping away to the band's cover of Mumford & Sons... they're quite good actually! Dancey pop music fills the void when the band is on break and the bar is cracking. Upstairs bar features shot specials at an unbelievable $6.50 for not 1 but 2 shots! Let's get loose y'all!,2017-08-13T08:15:14Z,134

450,Blarney Stone,3.2,"Once a year i always seem to end up here for someones birthday or just a friendly gathering, and every year i go it seems to always be the same:
- Extremely Loud, I mean its the loudest bar you will ever enter, not a single place you can have a conversation without yelling like your at a concert. 
- Extremely packed, Not very much seating, and even less places to stand. Just overall a not very well designed pub.
- Expensive food, when you think of Irish pubs, you think of comfort/pub food. Every time i have ever ordered food i'm not just disappointed with the food, I am also disappointed with the prices. Your best bet its to walk around gastown and get Donair or walk to a local pizza place. 

The only redeeming quality of the whole place seems to be the drink specials and the friendly staff.",2016-08-07T21:04:00Z,134
451,Blarney Stone,3.2,"It's loud, it's cramped, it's expensive.

In no way is this an Irish pub, rather the Blarney Stone is a place to drink and rub against people. IMO there are already enough places where I can't hear my friends and get elbowed by strangers. 

Why are the drinks $$$? Is it a privilege to be there?

Again, not a pub.",2016-06-24T09:48:29Z,134
452,Blarney Stone,3.2,"Review for drinks and lack of honest business practices:

Came there with an empty stomach and ready to drink for a big St.Paddy's event. 

Ordered a pint of Kilkenny and told it was a $20 minimum. Never heard of this before but bartender explained and I told him I'm only ordering one maybe two drinks since this irked me.
He mentioned he would all this once. But after that I had to order by drink minimum. 

The Kilkenny beer was watered down. Pretty much ruined my impression and night because I don't like feeling ripped off. I asked a 70 year old Irish guy and guys in the 30s and they felt it was weak (water in it most likely).  I didn't feel any different particularly since I had no supper that evening and early light lunch.

He charged me $7.50 and I told him its $6.50 and he said it had tax. That much tax? I added a tip and was pissed off.  The event was great - band, dancers pipes, however it soured my feeling toward ever eating or drinking there.",2016-03-13T18:53:44Z,134
453,Blarney Stone,3.2,"I have been to several bars in Vancouver and this place was the worst experience i have ever had. I went to Blarney Stone with my girlfriends and one of our friends joined us later but she had forgotten to bring her picture Id. The bouncer didn't let her in, which is fair enough, but he was being rude to all of us and when i spoke to him to just say that he could have been a little polite and there was no reason to yell at us, he got even more angry and grabbed my hand and tried to push me out and asked all of us to leave. He was being an a**hole and needed to get his shit together.

The lineup usually begins to form around 9:30 p.m. The crowd is mixed, with mainly college kids packing the place on weekend nights.

Cover is between $8 and $10, with drinks running about $5 per pint. Check out the twoi-for-one shooters at the upstairs bar.",2008-10-20T18:52:42Z,134

A slightly more mature crowd populates this place on a happening night and still keeps that casual vibe where everyone is just there to have a good time and drink and dance.

There's plenty of unpretentious people here and as a result I've met a lot of great people who are now friends.

It's easy to get drinks as the bartenders serve things up quickly and are efficient with the crowd.",2008-08-25T23:32:28Z,134

No warning, just a comment you can move with it but then they GAVE our table away.  We were there for a few hours, planned to be there for a few more and had already racked up a $100 bar tab but they didn't care. The waitress blamed management and the manager blamed the waitress.

The Blarney Stone jumps on Fridays and Saturdays. We were a large group, had a great server, sang along to most of the songs! It's a fun place, leave your worries at home!

The fish and chips was very large, and good. The poutine surprisingly good, and the salads really wonderful. This is not a fancy pants place - wear your comfortable, cool clothes as you will be on the dance floor most of the night. Ask for a pitcher of water for your table. 

Most of our group got carded - so do take your i.d.

475,Blarney Stone,3.2,"I can't attest to this place as a nightlife venue, but since I work nearby I've been here for lunch many times and always have a good experience.

The interior of this place is actually really nice - it has a genuine Gastown-y/European old style pub feel , but with some great modern features (read: possibly the biggest projector screen I've ever seen in a pub). The upstairs mezzanine area is cosy and great for viewing said projector. There's also a few armchairs to lounge around in, and in summer a decent patio along the sidewalk.

The staff, although ridiculously clad in tiny kilts, are always friendly. The drinks are reasonably priced, and there's usually a decent daily special (both for food and drinks). I despise the unwieldy, never-cold beer mugs they serve in though!

The food is also quite good. I've really enjoyed the salads, nachos and yam fries I've tried here. I'm also told the bangers and mash and pies are great.

This is also a perfect place to watch sports - the number and quality of the screens is ideal. All in all a solid, non-hipster option in Gastown.",2015-02-17T05:30:52Z,134

For large groups, they have more secluded private tables, but for smaller 1-2 sized groups they have longer community tables which is great for meeting new people. I went when the place wasn't packed, but crowded enough to cover the dance floor while having a good personal space. This made it super enjoyable and took away the shoulder-shoulder clubby aspect of going out. The drinks are alittle pricey, but thats what happens when you drink at any bar. Look online for their daily specials, which include discounted food and drinks. I'd give the truffle fries a 6/10 but still is great finger food for any tipsy individual. Other drinks tasted:
            - the lipstick jungle: 8/10
            - long island ice tea: 7.5/10

480,Blarney Stone,3.2,"Woah. WOAH!

So the Blarney Stone has a log of DEEP FRIED Mac and Cheese. I'm not even joking a little bit.

I ate the shit out of this deep fried log of delicious on Wednesday night. I actually did need a bit of help with it, especially since I had stolen some of the nachos and about half the cheese platter that was ordered by someone else at our table earlier on. It comes with a salad smothered in ranch dressing but I'm sure most of you don't care about a salad if you're ordering deep fried cheese pasta.

The nachos were alright, but my heart belongs to the Foundation's nachos. Nothing will ever compare, and I've accepted that. The cheese platter seemed like kind of a joke, but it's cheese and I didn't pay for it.

In the past I tried their Kilkenny Tofu which was so spicy that it was actually pretty unpleasant and I decided not to eat it, I never reviewed that because the waitress was nice enough to take it off the bill for us and I felt bad about writing a review based on that alone.

I would probably never come to the Blarney Stone to ""go clubbing"" on a weekend because I am not a fan of standing in line to get into a place where I'll hate everyone. During the week it's pretty great though just for kicking back with a friend and having a few drinks. Nights like that remind me of why I like the Blarney Stone. Also, it's fun to watch creepy guys who are poorly dressed hunt down girls to hit on. Really? You think you're gonna take a girl home in those dirty running shoes? Okay.

481,Blarney Stone,3.2,"WARNING: THE POOL IS A TRAP!!! 

I mean it. We went to Blarney Stone multiple times before. We must've been so well scheduled, it probably all fell on a Tuesday. Because the last Monday we were there, to play some pool - each game ranging from 5 minutes to half an hour because we suck that much- and have a drink. A few pitchers down and we're getting sloppier. Nevertheless, when a friend of ours approached the bar again, she was questioned about the tab. What tab? We were paying cash all along, no? Get ready *drum roll*

THE POOL TAB!

What?

So apparently it's $2.50 for EVERY 15 MINUTES! Oh my oh my... I have never had to pay over $2 for any pool game, and I lived in cities with far more expensive night lives than Van. On top of that, no signage, no proper warning, no heads up that we're opening a tab. They gave us the cues, the balls were on the table and they clocked us on. We of course protested, noticing the lack of warnings or signs around the table and were told that it was the deal. In all honesty, considering we had paid off our alcohol as well as tipping generously all night, I would have walked out with the 'pool tab' on the table, though my Canadian companions are far nicer (ah ofc).
We paid our $14 something bar tab, and left the place immediately after thinking maybe sitting in that corner was also costing us. How about the smokers? Could I grab a lighter -it'll be $1.50 per strike. -Oh!

One thing that was completely perfect from the start, however, was the Canadian-style poutine. Oh man. Words fall short of describing just how amazing this was. Fries drenched in cheese curds and gravy. Wowza. SO. GOOD. Get. it.

Service was good. TVs on, playing sports. Very cool atmosphere.",2012-08-21T06:59:01Z,134
484,Blarney Stone,3.2,"Yeah, I go here. And yeah, it's fairly regularly. And yeah, I have definately experienced better. But damn it if I don't always have a good time at this place, against all odds.

The Blarney Stone is kind of an anomaly. Cover is a lot for what you get. It's always packed to the brim with first year University students and vaguely creepy older dudes scoping them out. The band is ancient and has the exact same set list that they do not deviate from under any circumstance - seriously, don't ask. The bars are almost impossible to get to and the bartenders ain't always the most attentive. The food is pretty bland. And please God don't ever go in on a non-Saturday and see it with the lights on or you might never come back.

That being said - this place seems to bring out the fun side of people. How can you NOT have fun bouncing up and down to an Irish jig? (It's really hard to dance sexy to an Irish jig, I'm just saying.) And for that, I must give the Blarney Stone props.

And you know what? Despite all my griping, you'll probably see me there again soon!",2011-06-21T17:36:22Z,134
485,Blarney Stone,3.2,"So I know this place is mainly hip with first year uni students and backpackers. As a late twentysomething, I fall under neither category anymore (sigh). So this wouldn't be my first choice of bar to come to with friends. 

However, we were looking for somewhere to watch the Canucks vs San Jose and every other bar in the area was rammed a good hour before the puck dropped. The Blarney Stone actually still had space! 

Combined with cheap pub food and pitchers under $15, not a bad place to watch. 

It also helps that this place is literally a 20 second walk from our flat. Sweet!",2011-06-13T01:01:58Z,134
486,Blarney Stone,3.2,"Oh the Blarney Stone. A timeless choice. We came here when we first turned 19 and then again last weekend. There's always a wide age range of patrons and so you don't feel like you're partying with babies or seniors. I like how they've renovated the front area so there's another bar location choice. Staff is always very helpful and they have a wide range of drinks available. 

Weekends have their live band, playing covers of all kinds. The DJ music in between sets provides rock music to dance to and so it's a nice alternative to your top 40 bars. 

Cover is super high for Vancouver at $12 and so make sure you get your night's worth. Lines move quickly, especially at the start of the night, as they like to keep people outside to make it look popular. If you're a dude, get ready for a pat down at the front door! Wheeeee!",2011-04-07T18:24:49Z,134

488,Blarney Stone,3.2,"As an Irish man I'm embarrassed by this place.. $12 cover on Friday, they do not accept debit cards and they have a $20 minimum spend on credit cards. Fairly obvious they want cash only to avoid paying tax! 

The staff taff inside have a huge ego problem too (except the door man who was a nice dude)..  At the end of the night an 3 idiot ""bouncers"" (one who was an Asian guy called Mike) LITERALLY pulled a chair from underneath my girlfriend as she was finishing her drink to hurry her up without evening asking her first. She fell to the floor and hurt her wrist while they just laughed..

490,Blarney Stone,3.2,"Went last night with a group of friends for a birthday; had dinner and drinks early in the evening. Our server was attentive and the food was all around good. It was very busy early on because there was a large pub crawl going on with university students. We later went to get a drink from the bar at the front and the bartender was absolutely miserable. He said ""apparently chucky cheese is closed tonight"" in reference to the large student group. He was blatantly upset about the crowd and was very rude to the rest of the patrons. As the night progressed, it was busy as usual. The security needs to be improved, there were several intoxicated and aggressive men on the dance floor that were harassing many women. I looked to find a security guard to report it, but I literally could not walk over to them because the bar was so overcrowded. The band is always top knotch wth a lively dancefloor, however the dance floor was literally covered in broken glass. There was nobody clearing drinks off tables or cleaning up the dance floor. It was a mess. When we were leaving later in the night, our previous server came up to us outside and asked for a cigarette (who was now wasted). None of us in the group smoke, so we politely her we did not have any and she scoffed and walked away.

Overall, I used to love the Blarney Stone. However the overall service has seriously declined. I would no longer recommend this place!",2019-04-07T22:39:47Z,134

While I was in Gastown I ran in here on a random find. The drinks aren't bad but the best part maybe the bartenders. 

One of the bartenders had my attention because was a total sweetheart. After some thirsty guy was hitting on her all I could think of was some sexy cleavage. I hope she works there at night because I would give her more than a tip.

It's got a good layout and I love the ""Irishness"" (even if it's not that authentic). The band is awesome and really gets the crowd going. 

My only complaint? Other than Friday and Saturdays, the place is deserted. Like dismally empty, so weeknight parties, steer clear of this locale!

I get that it's an Irish pub and that sort of music is expected, but come on! They were playing really old-school music (and not the good kind!) and the pub was practically filled with 20-25 year-olds! What were they thinking?! Wake up! This isn't your old-folks home annual dance-off! Just stick with your relevant DJ!

Sunday afternoon and the football game on a giant screen and several large screens. Great if that's what you want. We didn't want a sports bar. Left after one drink and meal.,2017-01-23T18:42:06Z,134

I had emailed about making a reservation and didn't get an email back so I think they were a bit surprised when we showed up HOWEVER Niamh was serving us and was an absolute legend! She was so kind and patient with our large group. She was serving a group of about 40 people on her own and she was still super efficient and above all else kind! Everyone had a really great time and I would go back again and again, the atmosphere was nice too :)",2017-03-14T01:52:44Z,134
500,Blarney Stone,3.2,"The Blarney Stone is certainly an interesting hangout in the middle of Gastown. It's a little bit of Irish pub mixed with urban Vancouver dance club -- a strange combo indeed! But it pulls it off pretty well, and everyone there seems to be having a good time. 

It was unlike any club I've been to so far, that's for sure. It didn't take us long to get in, and once we got in, it was nearly impossible to manoeuvre around. The place was packed! You literally had to squeeze your way through everywhere. 

There are two floors, with the bar and small dance-floor on the main level, and additional seating on the upper level. Anyone who has had a bit to drink is cautioned on going up the stairs, because they are quite high and steep. 

The night really got going when they started playing Great Big Sea and almost everyone on the dance-floor was jumping up and down, the guys with a great big pitcher of beer in one hand. Being of small size, I was terrified of being trampled to death -- if you're like me, all you can really do to save yourself is keep moving with the crowd. Otherwise you probably will get trampled. 

I like that the crowd isn't made up of teeny boppers, and it has a more relaxed atmosphere, rather than the usual feel of a sweaty meat market like most dance clubs. The music was good, the kind that makes you wanna dance like you're jumping on a trampoline, but not really shake your booty. Personally, I prefer the latter kind. So overall, a good experience, but I'm still unsure if it's converted me to a pub-ish kind of club just yet.",2008-12-07T20:22:40Z,134

      Never looked at menu but feel it would be more a great place for younger 30 something's to hang out at night.  Great bar ambiance, wood walls, balcony overlooking The main floor.  Several outside tables with open doors do the next tier of tables feels outside too.

Well, we're visiting, so a different night doesn't work. I asked to speak to the owner or have the owner called but Donnie refused. Donnie claimed the place being bought out was posted on their social media but admitted it wasn't posted on their website, where we bought the tickets.

508,The Yale Saloon,3.1,"Came by for some Thursday night AYCE BBQ goodness for $19, available 1600-2000.  They even throw in a can of beer too.

Parking is a bit lacking in the immediate vicinity.  Best to look either under Granville Bridge, or along Pacific.

The inside is western-themed as expected, with a bit of a funky twist.  Neat wall of vinyl records on the wall.

Staff are friendly and nice.

The buffet itself is actually a lot smaller than expected.  Purple cabbage coleslaw, egg salad, quinoa, cornbread, and slow cooked beans are the sides.  Relatively decent quality, and quite tasty.

The meat selection is some kind of turkey, pulled pork, and a chunk of beef brisket, which is cut by a staff member.  Not really sure if the guy was new, but this guy was holding the brisket WITH HIS BARE HAND while he cut slices off it.  Couldn't he have used a fork instead?  Gross.  Knock 1 star off for this.  If management is reading, please train your staff.  I'm pretty sure this must violate some food preparation standards.

The other complaint is that they ran out of brisket by 1830 and didn't even replenish it, with a solid 1.5 hours left in the buffet period.  I asked the staff and they simply said they were out.  My friend and I found this to be quite unacceptable as well, as the brisket is 1/3 of the meat selection.  Knock another star off.

Overall the food is half-decent, but these 2 point listed brought an other 4 star experience into 2 star territory.  As a result, I have trouble recommending this place, and don't think I will be back anytime soon.",2016-06-15T06:06:12Z,65

Our serverS plural greatest concern was flirting w/ a male coworker.

The meat is consistently dry. The menu small. The portion sizes are paltry and the sides are terrible. I don't have a single good thing to say about the food from this place. Also, how do you mess up fried pickles? Seriously. Don't eat here.

If you're coming for drinks, a dance and the mechanical bull, I guess you could do worse. This is about as country as Vancouver gets. But it still falls very short of the mark.",2020-02-06T02:26:59Z,65

512,The Yale Saloon,3.1,"my wife ordered ribs, brisket, chicken, coleslaw and mac&cheese. it was about $60 worth of food. we had it delivered thru one of those delivery apps and the delivery time wasn't excessive.

what was excessive was the sheer amount of salt in all of the meat. half of the brisket was so salty it was shriveled up like jerky. we didn't even finish a quarter of anything other than the mac&cheese.

i specifically asked for no green onions. usually when an item has green onions in it, my experience is that the restaurant would notify me if an item i ordered has it pre-mixed into it and ask if i wanted something else as an alternative. that would be reasonable customer service but no such communication here. the coleslaw was basically half green onions.

to top it all off, all of the food was ice cold. i have never had any food delivered that was ever that cold. and like i said, the delivery did not take that long from when it was picked up from the restaurant.

i would never order from this place again. the bbq was inedible. i usually feel bad throwing food away because of the waste but no remorse chucking this stuff. it ended up where it belonged.",2021-03-02T23:22:49Z,65

The staff make you genuinely feel like they appreciate you're there, and are happy to see you!

It is my go-to order every time, as well as St. Louis Style Ribs with Texas Dry Rub, smokey and fall-off-the-bone goodness.  Rotisserie Chicken Legs and House Smoked Farmcrest Chicken Wings are also excellent add-on items.  For sides, I recommend Mac N Cheese and Onion Rings.  If you dine at their dog-friendly patio, the Mac N Cheese comes in a little cast iron pan, keeping it hot and gooey.  Onion Rings are beer battered, thin and crispy, just the way I like it!  Rodeo Fries are not ideal for takeout as the fries would become soggy from the gravy and chopped tomatoes.  House Salad is quite refreshing and tasty with dried fruit and lemon-herb vinaigrette.  For drinks, American Vintage Hard Iced Tea and Okanagan Crisp Apple Cider both go great with the barbecue food.",2020-11-04T00:15:29Z,65
517,The Yale Saloon,3.1,"This is a fun place to go with a group, to celebrate an occasion.  Yale Saloon really knows how to cater to large groups, particularly as we were there for a bachelorette party. 

Our group came here for dinner, drinks and line dancing and were promptly seated with our set reservation.  The staff was very welcoming, hospitable and friendly.  They made sure that everyone was having fun.  Also, one of the employees all taught us how to line dance, which made our time there even better.  Plus, for the bride to be, they put a cowboy hat on her and made sure to pay extra attention to her, calling her out to dance!  We also had a memorable time, riding the mechanical bull!  The employee who was there to operate the machine also helped you up if you were unable to step up on the bull, since it's high up on an inflated floor.  The only minor issue was that there were holes in the inflated floor and sides, so it's not as firm as it should be. 

For the group/party dinner, there is a set three-course meal.  You have a choice of a drink, an appetizer, an entree and dessert for $39.  I chose the sweet tea (versus Coors), the pulled pork tacos, the smoked turkey plate and the Burt Reynolds shot for dessert.  Unfortunately, the idea of a three-course dinner with a drink sounds better than what it was.  The food was inedible.  I barely could eat anything.  The sweet tea was the best thing about the meal, which came in a mason jar glass, for a nice touch.  But the pulled pork on the tacos was so, so dry and the tortilla was so stale that it was hard.  I took two bites and called it good.  The Smoked Turkey Plate was slightly better though.  The sides were good, and liked that the potato salad and coleslaw were both chilled.  But the turkey was super dry and couldn't even finish one strip of the meat I had.  For dessert, I thought it was cool that they have an option of getting a dessert shot instead of the pie of the day, which was cheesecake, so ordered the Burt Reynolds shot, which the server described as butterscotch - a flavor I love.  Unfortunately, when I took the shot - it tasted like medicine!  It was horrible, and would never again drink that.  Bleh!  

Everyone had fun for the most part, but I definitely would not advise eating here.  The food was mediocre.  Come for the line dancing and even if you don't like country music - it's still a fun environment and I really liked how everyone got in the spirit.  Plus, the staff are the friendliest people!  Or if you're drunk enough - ride the bull.  It always makes for a memorable time, and since I'm coming from the Seattle area - bars with bulls are hard to come by these days.  Glad to know they still exist, just in case...",2017-06-21T22:06:16Z,65
518,The Yale Saloon,3.1,"Can't say anything about their dinner, because we went there for the night club on a Saturday, which was terrible. It was one star for me and another invisible star because my friends had fun at least! 

The experience started in the car staring out the window where a young looking kid waved at me. Ew, don't wave at me high school student. That's creepy. I'm a decade older than you. Then I was in the line. I looked behind me and in front of me. The boys, not guys, were all college-aged, don't even think about sexy cowboys in hats and boots. Nada. Then it took us a while to get in. The bouncer was terrible. He didn't have any charisma or conviction whatsoever and was talking to you while looking in all the other directions like he's confused. Once we stepped inside, it was hot, stuffy and crowded. And the cover was $14... really? For a shitty club like this you have the audacity to charge $14?

Someone was riding the bull and looked like she's having fun. The music was mostly country music which was my absolute nemesis. I really tried to like it. I couldn't do it, just not my thing, I can't dance to stuff like this even when I'm drunk. My annoyance might be just amplified with alcohol. But I'm really happy my other girlfriends enjoyed it. It's all good. Their sound system was kinda crappy though. 

The bathroom... probably the dirtiest that I've been to. For a semi-germophobe like me, it might have hit my limit that day. All 3 sinks were clogged. All soap dispensers empty. Two stalls didn't have bathroom tissue. Floor was wet. The best part was this - there was a guy who was rushing to the men's room while I was coming out. He couldn't make it in time and some of his puke landed on my jacket and my legs. Oh well how sanitary that was. That's the problem with a young crowd like this, you have young inexperienced drinkers who don't know their tolerance and can't hold their liquor. I don't think it will happen as often for a more mature crowd. That kid should be dragged and kicked out by security, as it happens in a lot of nicer clubs, but it's so chaotic and rowdy in there with couples making out in every corner so the fact that it was overlooked didn't surprise me. Even if I was drunk, I don't think i could ignore everything that i saw. 

Bad vibes since being in the line and I guess getting puked on shouldn't be a surprise to me huh. I'm glad we didn't stay for too long and the rest of the group seemed to have fun so I'm happy after all. But as for the quality of this club, I'm even generous to give them one star. 

I honestly think you can have fun dancing without being in such a gross and shitty environment. I just didn't feel comfortable the whole time I was there. This club is so subpar compared to any club Ive been to. I just don't think it's worth the trouble, the money and the time to come here for a night out. But if you like to have a night out where you see drunktards everywhere, get elbowed a few times by drunk dancing people, possibly get puked on by a young kid who still had facial hair, then maybe this is the place for you.",2018-04-17T05:24:11Z,65

521,The Yale Saloon,3.1,"The newly refurbished Yale Hotel and Saloon rests in that old section of Granville Street, you know where you used to go as a kid cuz they'd serve anyone. From the outside, you might get the impression that the Yale is a ""blues/jazz"" bar, but it's really not so much.  Once inside, it's got the slick look of a modern country bar with must-haves like a mechanical bull you can ride after signing away any rights to retribution should you get hurt (you won't, the bull is surrounded by a bouncy castle playground and never gets going very fast, it's what they call a ""gringo"" bull). They've also got line dancing for the uninitiated and lots of country & western paraphernalia scattered around the room and bolted to the walls, and of course the obligatory giant flat screen TVs all over the place, Heaven forbid we miss a Canuck game.

It's a big space with lots of room for large groups with a front area (home of the rubber bull) and a larger rear room, complete with wooden dance floor and mini stage area, presumably for those jazz groups that play there.  They've got a kitchen that churns out average fare at best and a couple of bartenders that mix up the booze.  

So why the 4 our of 5 stars?  Well, the staff is great.  From the GM, Seamus, who's everywhere he needs to be and a right friendly fella, down thru all the many servers who are always happy to help and there when you need them. The Yale is an old hotel sitting near the end of Granville, that's been spiffed up and gentrified for the kind of clientele that they're probably hoping to attract. It's no real jazz bar, way too clean for that, but with a perky, friendly staff and decent enuf food and drink for the price paid, It's definitely worth a visit. And more importantly, the vibe the staff helps create makes for a fun night out for all.",2015-12-19T07:04:05Z,65
522,The Yale Saloon,3.1,"This place is lacking in so many ways. 

The in-house prices do not match their out of date website, and some items on the website menu are not even served anymore. Expect to pay more when you get there.

The beer selection is terrible and only fit for a southern state. And unless you're a fan of Coors and mainstream beer, you're out of luck. 

When it turns into a club at around 10pm, the sound quality is terrible. It sounds like an AM radio turned up to 10. 

When it's busy, the bathrooms are filthy.

Unless you're a 20 year old looking to get drunk for the first time, you can do better in downtown Vancouver.",2017-02-07T20:25:44Z,65
523,The Yale Saloon,3.1,"We went to Yale after it was voted the ""BEST"" bbq in Vancouver in the Georgia Straight.  What a disappointment!   We arrived, unintentional during happy hour, and so we thought great, a chance to sample their BBQ and save a few pennies.  We ordered the brisket sliders and the pull pork taco.   We were shocked when the sliders arrived.  There maybe 3 small pieces of meat per slider, each the size of a dime.  The cost for this was $8.   It was just wrong.

The portion for the pull pork taco was better, but the taste was just so-so.

We will not be back!",2017-09-23T17:10:54Z,65
524,The Yale Saloon,3.1,"Always a great vibe. There is something for everyone. We had a great time the other night. We came for the food and stayed for karaoke. This place attracts a younger crowd and is always lit up with excitement.

526,The Yale Saloon,3.1,"I never expected to find the best BBQ I've ever tasted while visiting Canada. This place is amazing! Delicious food, kitschy atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff - come on down, you won't be disappointed.

Heartily recommended: the buffalo chicken sandwich was done perfectly, and the chili was just beautiful.",2016-05-16T05:36:54Z,65
527,The Yale Saloon,3.1,"This place just re-opened after being closed for what seems like forever.

What got my interest was that the outside makes it look like a cool blues place, but once you get inside, it looks like some middle-american country bar.  The music?  Country as well.  It's too bad though.  There really isn't any legit Blues-type bar in Vancouver, and that would have been fucking awesome to see.  Kind of a let-down.

It's essentially a big room with really small tables, and an average sized bar.  It was empty when I went, so I guess they're finding their legs at the moment with regular customers/bar patrons.

I decided to give the food a try, as there aren't many legit BBQ places around downtown.

The food was just about average.  

Pulled Pork was ok, although the sauce was kind of an odd type of sauce, as it wasn't really suited to be used with pulled pork (kind of sour/bitter).  Pulled Pork definitely needs a sweeter type of BBQ sauce with it.

They have your typical sides that you normally see with BBQ, like slaw, beans, and cornbread.

I have to give it to them with the cornbread though.  It was really well made, pretty fucking good.  That's one thing they managed to knock out of the park.

Beans were not your normal beans, it was kind of a mixture of all types, which was an interesting change.  Slaw was ok, maybe a little dry, could of used a tad more dressing.

My biggest gripe is two-fold, as it goes hand-in-hand.

The prices are quite high, and the portions are not very large.

If they could increase the portion sizes of their meat, then it would justify the prices.  

I recommend that they either cut the prices, or increase the portions.  Otherwise, you end up with $40 worth of nothing, and a bewildered empty stomach

You should take a look at their take-out container.  It makes you think you're getting his huge fucking meal, and you open it up, and there's barely anything inside.  Way to get my hopes up Yale Saloon.  

There is some potential there, but there's a long way to go before I would consistently eat here.",2015-12-15T03:38:49Z,65
528,The Yale Saloon,3.1,"Ok, this is going to be a great review. Best country atmosphere on the west coast, great smoke house food, amazing drinks. Highly recommend this pre and post concert!! Honestly we had the best time before the Luke Bryan concert, we were all there to honour my nephew who passed away last year and he lived and sang Luke Bryan songs even at his most lowest times. We really connected with the AGM Aleem Allidina. My nephew loves Batman- who also came frequently to visit at the hospital and was a Pall Bearer, Aleem identified himself with Batman which was really cool. Anytime you're in Van City please visit this place and maybe even ride the bull!!!!",2018-10-21T01:15:30Z,65
529,The Yale Saloon,3.1,"Their kitchen was closed by the time we got there so we left then came back for drinks and to watch drunk people sing and dance. We came on a Sunday night so it wasn't busy, except for some regulars. It was karaoke night so the place was fun and entertaining. My boyfriend got the first round of drinks and the bartender didn't card him, and although she was a BITCH and very stand-offish, he still tipped (bless his soul). Our friends got the next round and she asked for all 4 ID's then started to accuse us of having fakes, which made no sense...(why would we have fake ID's for 19 year olds from Washington when the legal age is 21 in the states??) she looked up something on her phone taking at least 10 minutes, so I got annoyed and wanted to suggest leaving, but she finally gave us our drinks. A few drinks were poorly made or made incorrectly, and I wasn't drunk at all so I was able to tell the difference. The bus boy rudely took our drinks without asking if we were done, and kept coming back to our table to see if we've finished. I felt rushed to finish my drink, but at that point I was sick of their shit so I didn't care anymore. Overall, bad experience with this bartender but not as bad as at The Morrissey across the street.",2018-02-20T02:22:56Z,65
530,The Yale Saloon,3.1,"I'm not impressed with this place. The highlight of the place would have been the servers who were all friendly and attentive. What turned me off is the food and the associated prices. 

From the waitress's recommendation, I ordered the BBQ Chicken Sliders for $13, which consists of 4 tiny sliders, with crispy chicken and bacon in between waffle-like 'buns'. I also ordered their apparently very delicious, served on the skillet Mac and Cheese for $12. While I come away very full, a $30 bill for just an OK food did not leave me with a good impression. 

To be fair, I probably should have ordered their BBQ platter considering that this place seemed to focus on that. Also, I probably should have dropped by during weekend nights instead of weekday nights to maybe experience the 'fun' they advertised in their site. The bottom line for me is whether I would come back again and since this place is new, I would probably give it another chance, hence my 3 star rating.",2015-11-19T20:49:54Z,65
531,The Yale Saloon,3.1,"I'm sure the bar itself is cool, but lets talk about the bouncers. I went there and it was nearing closing time, but everyone talks about this place to I decided ot jsut check it out, The way this place is set up there's a bouncer outside, and then a cashier inside with another bouncer next to her.

I go to the bouncer outside and ask the cover,  he says $10, which is fine. So I give him my ID and just conversationally I say ""I've never been here, I'm probably just gonna go up to the cashier and peek inside to see what its like."" HE then pauses, and says that he has to keep my ID and to come back for it when I pay. I ask why, and he says thats just what I have to do. This makes no sense as I would have to pay to get into the bar ANYWAY, so I'm not sure why he would NEED to keep my id.

I leave it and I go inside to the cashier, and I just look around from there, I ask her a bit about the place, she describes it and was super nice, then I notice the bouncer from outside come in and whisper something to the inside bouncer. Anyway the cashier was like, ""you know what, its your first time here and its already late, you can just go inside"" , note, I didn't ask her to. I say ""oh ok, thanks""

As I'm about to go in the bouncer inside, grabs my arm and pulls me back (rudely) and says, ""hey you didn't pay!"". I told him the cashier said it was fine, he said he didnt care. So I went to the cashier and I guess I'm petty because I then put $10 into her tip jar (she was really nice anyway), and was about to leave when she tells the bouncer its ok, I paid. 

I go inside and take a walk around but those bouncers left such a sour taste, that the bar was really cool but i likely won't be going back. I don't know what made these bouncers think I was trying to scheme my way in or anything but, it was very rude. Went back outside and got my ID from the bouncer outside, and left.",2018-02-10T19:19:43Z,65

533,The Yale Saloon,3.1,"The food was really good and everything was going well untill they changed the waitress on us. The lovely Annie treated us foreigners great but her replacement at the bar was just an awfull person. I saw her making a drink and when I asked her what she was making she said that it was pretty gross and that I wouldn't like it anywat as if the drink was too good enough for me or something. At the end of our stay she said that she would only give us one more drink and that would be it (200 canadian dls into our bill). We thought maybe this place would be closing so my American Veterenan friend and I agreed to that last drink. I drank my Wente wine and my friend almost finished his beer but when he placed his glass back on the bar in front of the well, in an honest mistake he placed his cup on the ledge where a matt is supposed to be (the one that catches the spilled drinks) and thats when the bitter bartender lady emberrassed my friend by telling him that he needed to pay and leave because he was a danger to her and if we dindn't like it she threatened to get the manager. We both looked at her in astonishment because we have never been treated that way ever in our travels. It was our first time in Vancouver and what started off as an amazing night turned out to be a night of heartfelt discrimination. Especially for my friend that defended his country, to be told that he was a threat to her, is just wrong. I calmly got up and spoke to the manager, super nice guy as well, which only stated that he would talk to the bartender that took over for Annie. Thank you Annie for making us feel welcomed, we should have left when you took off for the night. I left you a 20 dollar tip with your manager. Make sure you get it. Thank YOU and only YOU for making our first time in Vancouver feel special and thanks for the wounderfull foood suggestions.",2017-10-19T15:46:06Z,65

To start we had Mac and cheese pops and chicken wings very tasty, and well you can't go wrong with chicken wings, following that, an awesome platter came, featuring Turkey Breast, Pulled Pork, Brisket with a side of baked beans, coleslaw, potato salad & jalapeño corn bread. The meats were perfectly cooked, moist, very tender if i have pick one will be the pulled pork so juicy!!! , truly confort food.

Overall it was a great experience, definitively I am coming back, this place is great for big groups, probably corporate & team building events, I might be having my birthday party here this year.",2016-04-21T17:12:29Z,65

While our meat did come out a little colder than it should have, this was promptly fixed by our server and another person (who I assumed to be the manager on duty) and the food cost was removed from our bill.

Had to send them back to cook them a bit longer as they were a little doughy in the middle and crisp outside. When we got them back they were crunchy and delicious! 
We got the brisket, it was fantastic! So much flavour! Did not like the ""coleslaw"". It was pickled red cabbage and not very good. The cowboy beans were tasty. The pork ribs were fall off the bone delicious! 
My only other issue was our mains were brought out while we were still eating our appies.

543,The Yale Saloon,3.1,Interesting place for sure! It's definitely a country bar and you can sense that as soon as you walk in. The lady servers are all dressed in cowboy boots and the whole works. Not sure if this happens all the time but our server got up on the bar area and danced like 2 times. I wasn't the biggest fan since I was sitting at the bar eating and that's why I dropped a star but I can see how some people would like that or maybe if I had been seated at a table it wouldn't have bothered me so much. The nachos are great definitely hit the spot! And they also have a mechanical bull which I swear everyone needs to ride. It was my first time riding one and the guy operating it was really nice and took it easy on me and didn't throw me off and make it an uncomfortable ride.

The 1 giant beef rib I got tasted like it's been living in the back of the fridge for a very long time and brought to life by ""chef mike""(meaning the microwave). The meat tasted rancid. We also had 2 pieces of over cooked dry fried chicken that comes with honey butter which had good flavour. A slop of sour beans or ""cowboy beans"" as they call it. French fries + chipotle mayo dip where good. The complimentary jalapeño corn bread was very tasty and that's the only reason I gave this place an extra star.

Vancouver is notorious for having servers with less than a positive attitude, so this was a nice change.  Food was exactly what you'd hope for in a BBQ style bar.  The GM went from table to table making sure everyone was comfortable and well taken care of.  Live sports on the T.V's, knowledgeable service staff, and great food.  I'll def. be back.

The food was fine - although several items on the party menu given to us were actually not being served anymore. Everything was very unorganized for the party package. No one we asked knew anything about line dancing lessons (the instructor wasn't even in on the day we went) or the complementary cowboy hat they advertise. The mechanical bull was fun.

Haven't checked out the live music yet so I will be sure to return for that. I think they have a ladies night too? Not sure when this is but good to know about!

Only recommendation I would have for the Yale is to have a drink special or a more reasonably priced option - drink prices are slightly steep but the atmosphere makes up for it!

I went with a bunch of meat eaters who couldn't get enough of the smoked meat, the candied bacon, the sliders- they tried everything. I am a vegetarian and had the portobello burger- one of the best veggie burgers I have ever had! (seriously). The mushroom was deep-fried and crispy, topped with jalapeños and sauce and a nice bun. Totally delicious.

The quinoa salad was also amazing. Unlike the normal, boring, salads- this one filled me up and had a lot of different flavours going on. 

I was also down with sides- coleslaw and the potato salad too. So delish!  All in all, a vegetarian can go to the Yale and be completely satisfied alongside the meat eaters. 

For a well priced, delicious meal downtown where you can walk in and get seated with a few friends then stay and drink and party afterwards- the new Yale has passed the test.

I questioned why it was so much and he told me we got to keep the little bucket/container it was poured into. I thought it was rather ridiculous but after a second thought, it would be a nice souvenir to commemorate the night of my friend's birthday. I carried this bucket the whole god damned night while dancing and perusing the venue. The night came to an eventual end and my friends and I started walking towards the exit. As we grew closer to the exit an employee approached me and WITHOUT A SINGLE WORD, snatched the bucket from my hands. Appalled I pulled back with minimal force as I was not trying to grow an aggressive situation.Eventually, she pulled so hard that I almost fell over. My friend promptly asked her why she was pulling the bucket away and the employee replied with, ""hoes don't get to keep those"". I was vexed at the assumption that I was a hoe... Is this not 2017? What are these willy-nilly assumptions being thrown around? Anyhoo, I tried to explain the best I could that the bartender told me I could keep the bucket as a souvenir, but this modern day Regina George would not listen to a single word I was saying. Eventually, me and my friend's had had enough and simply left. Safe to say my night was ruined by the ill-mannered behavior of that one employee and the over-priced, pinguid food that was served was not enough to redeem my judgment of the inbred raising establishment known as ""The Yale Saloon"".",2017-12-17T19:56:56Z,65

568,Vancouver Latin Fever,2.5,"Attended Lux Lounge for one of Vancouver Latin Fever's events and would never attend another one. We had taken salsa classes at a dance studio downtown and had been advised that Cuban Salsa was different so were excited to  attend Havana Nights at Lux on Friday night with a group of people. We were there to take part in the free class to determine whether we would like to pursue Cuban Salsa lessons and to spend time with a group of friends but little did we know that this is not what was going to happen. We arrived at 9:05 and paid our $12 cover (x 6) and proceeded to prepare ourselves for a new experience. The lesson was to start at 9:30 (as per the add) but little did we know that the instructor would decide to not show up until after 10pm and not hold any type of class. The DJ didn't even have the courtesy to let us and the approx 20 other people know that the instructor was too busy to attend. The next day I was told by a friend  that knows this group (Vancouver Latin Fever) that this instructor in particular is known for not caring about the clients time and that the company only cares about the cover charge they get. 
If you are looking for a Latin dance night I would definitely look for another promotor and not waste your time here.",2015-06-17T02:30:24Z,4

570,Vancouver Latin Fever,2.5,"I went to the Lux Lounge on my birthday and coat checked my bag. Upon leaving, I entrusted my ticket for my bag to my drunk roommate (which was a mistake in the first place). After forgetting to get my bag from the Lux Lounge, I called back and they informed me that Vancouver Latin Fever was in charge of the coat check and the door staff, so I called VLF instead. The man that answered told me I needed my ticket to retrieve my bag, but I had lost the ticket. I informed him I had my wallet in there and I'd be willing to bring my ID to get it back, but then he went on to say something about getting in contact with the person that worked that night and see if they found anything. After I didn't receive any information, I called VLF again to see if they can help me get it back, and this was well over a month. The man that answered again told me to find my ticket, and to send him a photo of what the bag looked like. After doing so, he sends me a phone number to call. So... I call the number he asked me to and I got no responses. Called back to VLF 30 minutes ago (I lost this bag in July by the way) and he tells me that someone must of picked up my ticket and took my things, and I must have my ticket to retrieve my bag, and if not I'm SOL. Told me he'd call me back in 30 minutes and still have not received a reply. Maybe it's my own incompetence for relying on a drunk roommate but VLF so far has not given me any help in retrieving my things and was fairly rude about it... so be careful if you're needing customer service because they won't give you any and don't forget your bag there because you'll probably never get it back.",2017-11-20T01:04:21Z,4

They had to delay the band because they were so slow in letting people in. The security guards were sadistic. When they patted me down the guy was like WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? Because I didn't walk up to him fast enough or something? One of them shoved me instead of telling me the bathrooms were closed. The drinks were overpriced, like 9 bucks for a little plastic cup of beer. I've heard of people losing items and they haven't responded to any emails or calls. Only one exit for like 2 thousand people attending the concert. I asked a guard where the exit was and he was very condescending and was like ""you see all those people over there? Yeah.""

There is a huge stage with a great sound system and lighting.   The artist vary, but the lights and screens provide a great backdrop for any artist performing.

580,Harbour Event Centre,2.7,"I love a good party and have never been picky. But my friends and i went to the insomnia afterparty at this venue. Literally called ""Insomnia Afterparty""
First off no backpacks allowed which makes no sense when these after party people are coming from a rave/music festival. Of course 1 out of 3 people have a backpack
Second i messaged them asking about their backpack policy prior to see how strict it was ( i messaged them a week in advance) no reply. 

Thirdly not a single place to sit down except vip tables which are extremely costly. Id think it was common sense that the crowd they were attracting for that particular night had been dancing at an EDM concert since 7pm and would be in need to sit down. Security would kick off anyone sitting on any steps and staff wasn't too nice when we asked if there was anywhere to sit.

Inside still looks the same, with the vintage ceiling and trim. They seem to have removed the bench seating though. Now it has more of a nightclub feel, with a dance area in front of the bar.

There are still some arcade games (including the ones where one throws a football or basketball etc.).

Only comment is that the music is definitely at nightclub levels. In other words, too loud to have a conversation. I think I'm getting old.

Not sure if I'd be back. Rather find a quieter place to chat. But it's a decent choice if one wants to dance and go deaf.",2024-04-02T07:06:52Z,268
584,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"Set in Gastown right along Water Street is the Lamplighter Public House. I came here on a Tuesday for dinner, drinks and to join the trivia fun. 

The group of us were split amongst three half-moon tables that can comfortably sit 6 people each, so we decided to squeeze 8 in. The service was very attentive, we were greeted and drinks orders were taken. When it came to food, that was another story. Half of our table received their order while the other half had to inquire on the status of their meal. 

I ordered the grilled avocado and crispy tofu bowl and it was disappointing. It was a salad without any taste and just had some spicy kick in the tofu, I felt misled by the description. I heard similar comments that the rosemary fries were too salty, the handmade dumplings were not appealing. To drink I ordered the Oh Doctor! which I also found disappointing, it was more tart and less creamy than I expected. After that, I switched to the Red Wax Drip and this was more my speed, like a moscow mule but with fruit. 

The trivia host was pretty great and brought a lot of energy to a large group of people. It was a fun night, I just wouldn't recommend eating here. It's pub-style food, so keep those expectations low.",2023-10-20T22:40:32Z,268

The server was nice enough to bring us a taster and we tried it. My friend really liked the blueberry one so that's what she ordered. I ordered the Northyards cider. They brought us a spiced nut snack which we devoured while having our beers. It's a dive bar that was fairly empty on a Thursday night. There were a few patrons who came and left. A few more stumbled in later than we did. The open space had pinball machines, TVs, and a speakeasy next door with craft cocktails that we both decided we should have ventured into first. It was a chill spot on our little tour of Vancouver.",2019-08-30T15:25:30Z,268
594,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"A-MAZ-ING!! Definitely a five-star place. Having never been in Vancouver and looking for a place to eat straight off a delayed plane, we saw a bunch of restaurants in the north end of the city. So, we decided heading there would lead to some sort of delicious meal, and we were so right!

We saw The Lamplighter, and since I vaguely remembered it from my research as being a good place to eat, we decided to give it a go.

The ambiance mixes Victorian and dive bar (pin ball machines and a pool table!). It's quirky, and it works.

Similarly, I noticed their food expertly pairs acid and savory together. I ordered the kimchi grilled cheese, which fairly obviously mixed the sweetly acidic kimchi with the savory cheese. However, my husband ordered the French dip. The meat was marinated in something with an an acidic flavor. Dipping it in the thick sauce paired those acidic notes with sweet yet again. To me, this seems to be a signature pairing because my ""side salad"" (with goat cheese, dried cranberries, blueberries, and strawberries) paired those sweet fruit flavors with the savory of the cheese and the acid of the vinaigrette. Top-notch flavors.

Of course, this is a beer place. The Lamplighter offers a plentiful local beer menu, all on draft. Both my husband and I enjoyed two of their unique beers. I drank the Red Truck Bourbon Berry Ale, while my husband sipped the Bomber Park Life Passion Fruit Ale. Both were pretty good. I am no beer expert, but I actually enjoyed the Bomber more because the passion fruit notes were quite strong.

Overall, we had a great time. The food was good -- I am still dreaming about those sandwiches! -- the service was good and prompt, and the beers g. I would definitely come back here in a heartbeat!",2019-09-20T04:42:06Z,268

The first time I tried them I felt largely ignored. In fact we left after 15 minutes because the waitress stopped by two times to give us menus by but would not stick around long enough for us to give her the order.  We knew what we wanted.  Crazy.  Just too much of a hurry. 

Came back the next day to try again (there was a beer we really wanted) and this time managed to get two beers.  Whew.  It was good beer.  With service like that though it's not a place I would opt for regularly.",2017-08-13T15:08:35Z,268

Seating is a challenge on weekend evenings. Find your own spot as the servers are not around to help you. You may feel unwanted and ignored at first but once you find a spot service should pick up.

The Lamplighter is the official pub for Manchester United footy supporters. 20% off meals with Man U card.

During game day - the menu is preset so I went with the Bacon Butty comprised of a fresh French roll, smoked bacon & eggs. Tasted very good. Now this is early morning so I probably could have eaten a horse as the saying goes, & still been satisfied.

My friends both ordered the Man U breakfast - their usual & both swear by it as top notch.

The Lamplighter is truly an old time classic pub that's been a mainstay in Gastown for decades. Located on famous Water St at Abbott St, there are lots of restaurants & shops nearby.

Ambiance: the pub is large, with fairly typical pub decor and lighting. Definitely a sports pub, as there are televisions throughout, featuring baseball and soccer.

Food: I ordered the kale salad, which was very decent. Apples, chicken, goat cheese, beets and almonds all chopped small for easy eating. I felt healthy eating this salad. Because I was going to a conference and not sure when I'd be eating again I also ordered the sesame pretzel. This was delicious, piping hot, with just the right amount of saltiness and the toasted sesame seed were a nice surprise.

Drinks: I didn't order a drink, but they have a pretty extensive beer offering and modest hard alcohol shelf.

Service: I sat at the bar and the service was average. Bartender was nice, but forgot one part of my order and I had to ask for more water. No problem, though, I wasn't in a hurry.",2017-04-20T19:29:56Z,268
601,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"Lamplighter public house was the first restaurant or pub we tried in Vancouver and I must say... I was a bit disappointed.

Atmosphere - Located near the Gaslamp district, Lamplighter looked like one of those old school, yet still hip bars to go into. Inside its completely open with TVs everywhere, pool tables, and pinball machines to play before, during, or after your meal. There was a lot of people when we went and the volume was definitely that of any other beer house or pub. 

Food - This was the first time we were going to try actual pub food from Canada and we were super excited! Luckily, they did not disappoint at all! We ended up getting the brisket poutine (pictured) to start off as an appetizer and it was delicious! YUM!!! The brisket was amazingly tender and the egg was a great garnish. As for the burger, I got this huge mushroom & swiss burger with onion rings loaded on top (pictured). I don't necessarily know the name of this burger but DAMN was it good! It was so big I had to split it up as I was eating so I can enjoy every little bite. 

Service - The reason I had to take off a few stars for my review is that it literally took us 20 minutes to get menus, another 15 minutes to order, and another 30 minutes to get our food. The wait to get anything was super long and our waitress was nonexistent during our entire time there. We had to call over other waitresses to try and get drinks, silverware, and extra sauces. I guess we can chalk it up to a busy night, but regardless the wait time was just too long for our taste. Especially after a full day of tourist activities...

I'd recommend this place to friends, but I'd advise them not to go if it looks too busy and packed. It might turn into a 2 hour commitment if so.",2018-08-30T02:07:30Z,268

608,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"Ok, so maybe I'm too old for places like this. I never thought I'd say that, but perhaps it's true. 
My husband and I recently came here and it was PACKED (it was a Saturday evening and, to compound matters, it was ""Dine Out Vancouver"" week). The hostess was lovely and said they had one available table, in the middle of the main dining room, and she lead us there. The table and chairs had food on it, so she apologized and wiped it all down. Hubby and I sat down but we could not hear each other talking. It was THAT loud in the restaurant. We sat but three feet from each other, if that, and could not hear each other. And the restaurant interior was so dark, like, SO SO dark, and the row of video arcade games beside us were so bright in the dark room, with their neon, glaring lights..... It was too much for us old fogies! 

Argh, I never thought I would be the ""old person"" in the room. What the hell happened?

Anyhow, I'm not sure if this place was darker and louder than usual when we visited or if this was their baseline ambiance, but be forewarned, this pub is not the place to go to unwind! It's more raucous than most pubs, but if that's what you're into, I'm sure it would fit the bill.",2017-02-01T08:50:22Z,268
609,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"Met up for a Yelp event at the Lamplighter on a recent brisk evening.
Even at 5:30 the place was loud and a little too dark for my liking.  Almost cinema dark!  Not conducive for Yelping photos - apologies for the poor quality.   I'm guessing this was on account of the Seahawks game already in progress.  

Lots of TVs around, and also a couple projection screens showing the football as well.  Never mind having to shout across the table - I had to pretty much shout to the person next to me to chat.  They have some nice long tables and booths to sit in, but by the time we got there these sections were busy and wouldn't accommodate our large group.

We ordered two pizzas to share - both Margherita with basil - simple but really good.  Nachos were pretty good, and the salted pretzel bites were easily one of the highlights of the night.  I stole a few yam fries which were also excellent.

I sampled the Rose All Day cocktail which had dodka, watermelon, mint, basil and lemon juice.  It was sweet and although small in size packed quite the punch!  I had the misfortune of ordering a Kronenbourg Blanc just before our party's five minute warning which left me with more drink than I could handle.  Thank you Karen for coming to my rescue!  Next time I would try the Garden Gimlet which has Kronenbourg in it.

Service was good - waitress was around several times for food and drink orders and didn't take long to deliver the goods.  The place got busier while we were there - I just wish they didn't substitute volume/darkness for atmosphere!!!  Perhaps a bar isn't the ideal place to relax after work, though I wasn't expecting dead quiet.  I would go back but would make sure that there's no football on.",2015-10-23T22:49:59Z,268

The drinks and food there are good. I suggest the Mojito (one of the best I've had) and the mushroom pizza - really tasty. I didn't expect such good food for a bar/pub.

Servers are always gentle and helpful, but even better they are paying attention to the customers needs. I love when I need something, lift my eye, and they just know it and come right to attend. It's great, keep it up with the awesome service!",2019-10-08T19:05:38Z,268
615,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"We stumbled upon the Lamplighter Public House today for lunch. I was a bit concerned as their menu outside was a true lunch menu but when we went inside, they were serving a Sunday brunch menu. Luckily, they had the Hangover burger, so we were able to get something a little heartier than eggs. Have to say, it was amazing. Totally different from the flavor one would expect from a burger. The sauce was a mustard seed sauce and the cheese had a kick. It had an egg on it as well though we opted to have it without the egg. I had the hand it hash towns which were more like potato wedges and my hubby had the fries. The meal for both of us was great!

And on top of that, it was a great sports bar! So if you want something different than the Spaghetti Factory (which the tour guide recommended), I would highly suggest the Lamplighter.",2016-09-19T04:32:48Z,268

I've never had poutine before and this one came topped with bacon onion gravy, cheese curds and a soft poached egg.  I don't generally like my fries soaked with sauce, but these were surprisingly good!

I also had the BEER FLIGHT, which is a great deal at $4.75!  You can choose any three beers and I decided on three local ones: Granville Island pale ale, Granville Island lager and Driftwood white bark.  A great way to start off our trip!",2015-10-07T03:18:51Z,268

Most people were watching the basketball game while everybody else played the quiz since it was trivia night.  Overall a good experienced!

Edit: I forgot to add that I came here for lunch the other day and their fish and chips were just okay.  Only one piece of fish for $16 which is a bit pricey.  I would give 3.5 stars if I could ..",2014-06-11T03:59:21Z,268

FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORT MANCHESTER UNITED, THIS IS THE OFFICIAL MANCHESTER UNITED SUPPORTERS CLUB OF VANCOUVER.

Back to normal voice...

This is one of the well known pubs in Gastown. You can find as many as 40 beers on taps with many specials on weekdays. Here is where they have trivia nights on tuesdays, bingo and bourbon nights on wednesdays. They will also have a new year's eve party and many other events at the Lamplighter.

On most days, the food at the Lamplighter is very good to enjoy. Sometimes, you maybe the unlucky customer with the dry burger and such, but they do a fine job. The waiters and waitresses do pretty well most of the time. However, when it comes to busy times, then you might have to be patient, since this place is pretty decently sized.

There is a secret door inside the restaurant that leads you to the Clough Club, which is another business. (I originally thought it was the Lamplighter VIP Room to begin with)

This is one of the places if you want to have a great night out if you are single or you are out with your friends.

I would go to this bar for a great and lively experience - great place to meet new people and have a great time. The food is alright but definitely large quantities and always to leave you full.

P.S The beer flights are 4.75 CAD dollars! That is never heard of in SF and such a good deal!

I like the social atmosphere and lively mood of the staff.",2015-11-04T18:24:11Z,268

628,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"Visited for dinner and drinks with my boyfriend, and we really weren't that impressed. When we first walked in the waitress that greeted us was super rude, and then when we sat at the bar it took a while for us to get served. I tried a flight of beers, and it was great! If I was rating this place just on beer selection they would get 5 stars. The beer was by far my favorite thing about our visit. The bartender was pretty friendly once we were finally served. 

For food we ordered wings and the sausage sampler, and both were just ok. The only food I had here that I really enjoyed were the yam fries. I would suggest just sticking with drinks here, and skipping the food. We probably will not go back if we are in the area again.",2017-03-15T19:41:09Z,268
629,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"I really love Gastown in Vancouver and I am aware that most of these restaurants will be touristy, just like this one. However, despite that, I enjoyed the food here. We got to sit outside and enjoy some beer and people watching. 

The only downside of sitting outside is that everyone gaukes over the railing to stare at your food. Please don't - I don't want your lice falling into my food. By all means, look, even ask, but have some respect. 

I had the lamb bolognese rigatoni and the portion was perfect for me. We did ask how big the Cesar side salad was and it was basically double the size than what was told to us. It's not quite that we complain about a bigger portions, but my fiance ordered his meal that didn't specify that it was on a bed of more salad - so he didn't really want to eat salad twice. His description said couscous, which is not salad. 

Either way, we enjoyed our lunch and would return to this place if we were to come back to Vancouver.",2019-09-30T19:58:06Z,268

""Gimme one of those.""

I wandered around gastown with my girlie and ducked into the first place that had the word 'bar' painted on the side. 

It was pretty empty, and we got a gigantic party table to ourselves.

Now, keep in mind, there were probably two or three other tables in the restaurant, two servers and a bartender.

Service was SLOW.

I was completely unimpressed by that.

Drinks were decent, we shared the brownie which was AWESOME, but bad service gets you knocked down a star. REALLY bad service is minus two.

Me and 24 of my closest friends decide to have a ladies night in Gastown and this was our destination! There was also a game that night. It is also Movember.(11/23) There was two stagettes plus our group of ladies and the club was PACKED! The DJ did not start until 10:30pm. Which I was surprised, but hey, I partied my butt of until 2am. They were having specials on double vodkas and after a few Sourpuss shooters I was the dancing Queen!! Yes!! This place is a guaranteed good time without the pretense of Yaletown. And the (female) DJ really kicked butt. Played some oldies but goodies, ya' know... ""hip hop classics""!!! I am sooo glad there are no more Retro nights!!!",2013-11-25T02:19:20Z,268
633,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"The Lamplighter Public House was a great place to try some trivia while on vacation. We were a little worried that the international questions would be difficult for our American brains, but we persevered.

This place fills up quickly! They take reservations on trivia night, so if you are a walk in I'd show up at least 45 minutes early!
I started with the Cucumber and Mint G&T. It was boozy and refreshing, the perfect porch drink. I quickly switched to beer since they had 50 on tap. I was shocked to see how many were local to BC! I followed my server's recommendations and had 3 phenomenal beers.

They were running a burger and beer special and they were nice enough to bring the burger out first and the beer when we were ready for it. The burger was simple, cheese, lettuce, and tomato. The burger had a nice char but retained enough moisture to just soak the bun. I tried the Vietnamese Short Ribs, tasty but not better than Kalbi.

634,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"I'd like to preface this by saying that I haven't been to Lamplighter for dinner since before it was owned by the Donnelly Group, and I'm pretty sure I'm not even that old yet.

What I will tell you though is that for lunch they have a 9.50$ menu which has all kinds of tasty things on it admittedly not the biggest portions, but portions that are sort of good enough.  You know, the amount of food we should be eating not the amount we think we want to eat.  The fish and chips are tasty, they don't bat an eye like some of other other places around here do when I say ""I'm on lunch, I can't have a beer, sorry"" and best yet they have a great big fuck off projector screen for those times that something like, say, the Euro is happening.

That, and the waitresses are all cute (as you'd expect) and friendly (which you wouldn't necessarily expect) and the service is prompt and the place isn't too busy and if you really like they have a lovely little patio so you can sit in the sun (although then you can't see the projector screen).

636,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"Did a bar hop in this area, first time we came here we sat at the bar and had one drink. We asked for the bill but were paying by cash so the barman took the money without actually giving us our bill. He took a while to count out the change but came back with just over $80 from a $100 bill. We asked for a receipt but he said he couldn't print it, we didn't think anything of this as it was roughly the same price that we had been paying in other bars. However, we then came back about 40 minutes later which was around 5pm at that time. We took a table instead as we wanted to order an appetiser, we ordered the cauliflower. The appetiser took forever, we were 2 drinks in and our server came and asked if we wanted another drink before happy hour ended. We clarified with her that our drinks were included in this and she yes, they are $4 each and it runs from 3-6. We then realised that the first time we were in the bar the barman took advantage of the fact that we were paying cash and charged us full price and pocketed the extra money. 

All in all, terrible experience at this restaurant. Having money stolen from the barman and waiting an hour for cauliflower. Definitely do not recommend, if you decide to go be careful sitting at the bar and paying cash!",2019-01-02T03:02:30Z,268
637,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,I'm torn about this place. Great beer selection and the best poutine I've ever had - but it had a strange smell. It reminded me of the disinfectant they use in college bars to clean the floors at night that leaves a faint smell of scented ammonia.

I got a BK Block Party (sweet cocktail) which was excellent and my spouse tried a few beers and selected the Hoyne pilsner. Both were delicious! They have local options for those wanting to drink local brews. Staff were super friendly and attentive. We were here 3-4pm Sunday.,2018-02-25T23:58:58Z,268
642,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"Stopped in here for food and drinks after running a half marathon and having day drinks all around town.

My bf and I walked in and were a tad confused, as there was no hostess or no 'seat yourselves' sign. The people in front of us grabbed menus and went to sit outside, so we followed suit. 

Our waitress arrived quite quickly and we settled on a 9 oz rose for me and an IPA for him. The specific IPA was at the recommendation of the server, after she told him she didn't like the one her originally ordered. He really liked the beer, so it seems she knew what she was talking about. My rose was a tad sweet for my taste, but still delicious given the sunny 80 degree day!

We ordered the poutine and pretty much devoured it instantly. The bacon onion gravy was so bacony and divine. Loved that!

Then, he had the hangover burger with rosemary fries. He inhaled it so quickly I have to assume he liked it!

I was craving wings, and since they were only $6, I had two orders (don't judge.) The Real Hot were a buffalo style and the thai were a soy-based sauce with sesame and scallion. Being from upstate NY I have to say these were delicious! They were quite small, but the flavors were fantastic. I found it interesting that the real hot came with 10 wings and the thai came with 12, but who am I to complain about 22 wings for $12?!

Overall we had a very pleasant experience and enjoyed our post-half-marathon-nom-fest here!",2014-09-03T16:56:31Z,268
643,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"Everyone loves a tall stage, and this venue proves that it's rappers and djs who like it the most. Some bands brave the vertigo and cram their set-up onto the plateau of a platform, but the Lamplighter is more renown for it's hip hop nights, not to mention burlesque shows. 

Despite it's location next to many of Vancouver's poshest nightclubs like Shine and Red Room, it's a trademark of Gastown, a club that still maintains its old man feel. A healthy mix between factory bar and nightclub, it's a good place to go to avoid the obnoxious overdressed teenagers and drink beer with less judgmental people. Like kids who can't afford expensive clothes and toothless elderly alcoholics. 

The drinks are $5 a pop, but there are specials. Worth noting is that beneath the bar lies one of the last entrances into Vancouver's secret underground tunnel system, a long stretching series of wide catacombs built decades ago for use as bomb shelters.",2008-12-19T22:08:45Z,268
644,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"Stopped in for a few beers, so cannot comment on the food. Bartender was completely unattentive, spending more time chatting it up with another customer down the bar instead of asking me for another beer. Not a huge deal, but I tried to flag him down multiple times, but never worked out for me. After paying 7+ dollars for two different pilsner drinks, I left. The one large positive aspect was the amount of TV's and sports game they had running that night, which made it easier to hang around for another round of beer.

I had to ask for condiments..which I shouldn't have to do. I asked for extra veggies on the burger...it wasn't added. The food was mediocre & so was the service.

649,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"Stopped in at The Lamplighter today at 3:30 PM for a beer, as they advertise that they have some 40 different beers on tap. True, they have a very good selection of beers & true that they've renovated the place and it does not look like The Lamplighter of old.  However, the atmosphere is pretty dead & 3 of the bar's 11 tvs were tuned to CNN and the remaining 8 tvs were all tuned to soccer on Bein Sports.  I asked the bartender if he could turn one of the televisions on to the Golf Channel, as the PGA's Waste Management Phoenix Open is on.  He replied that they are not allowed to show certain kinds of programming, including golf & various types of women's sports.  When I asked further about this strange phenomenon, given that we are in Canada and they're showing CNN panel groups from the USA, he just shrugged his shoulders and said that's what management wants.

In light of the above, I cannot recommend The Lamplighter and I would recommend that people avoid this place until the Donnelly Group changes their discriminatory and sexist attitudes.",2019-02-02T00:01:42Z,268
650,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"It's 9am on Saturday morning, and my life has been spared by some vitamin water. I feel like a bag of shit. Could it have been the double highballs they have on special on Fridays for about $7.50? It's a good possibility. Could it have been our waitress, who kept my glass full all night? That could have been a factor too.

A bunch of us went to the Lamplighter after work for some celebratory drinks around 6pm.... and then suddenly it was midnight, and I was drinking an Irish car bomb that someone bought me, and the rest of the night.... not so sure. When we first arrived they had a self serve coat-check, where you can just hang up your shizzle, but at 10pm (I think?) they have a girl who turns the little area into a coat-check booth and she will take care of your stuff for you. I am glad they made this adjustment, as I remember going here before and they had no coat-check at all.

I know I ordered some of the skinny fries, so I wouldn't be drinking on an empty stomach, they came with garlic mayo, which was strong enough to be a vampire killer, and just as delicious, and I can still taste the garlic on my breath this morning, along with that dry boozey mouth feeling. ugh...

The place gets packed fast, like lineup and $10 cover packed by 10pm. Strange that a pub would charge cover? Well apparently the tables get cleared away, to make room for a dance floor, making it a club, so that makes charging ten bucks okay. The music is actually really good, so be sure to thank DJ P Deady and Ernold Sane for their musical choices. I have to admit, for a Donnelly Group club, my standards were pretty low, so I was pleasantly surprised. I probably wouldn't wait in the line if I were to go back, but I would probably go back.",2010-04-10T17:28:38Z,268

653,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"We accidentally wandered into Gastown after getting off the Canada line, straight from the airport, and found Lamplighter. It wasn't busy but there were a few people hanging out. Service was a bit slow for a pub that wasn't busy around noon. We ordered shrimp dumplings, chargrilled vietnamese short ribs, poutine lyonnaise, and cole's original french dip; And a lager and pale ale.

The shrimp dumplings were the star of our meal. They were absolutely delicious. They smelled like pho and tasted like pho, but in a dumpling. 

The chargrilled vietnamese short ribs weren't bad. Just the typical vietnamese marinade on a nice cut of beef, which I'm used to associating short ribs with korean bbq. That's just my bias.

Lamplighter's poutine was our first poutine ever, in Canada and the US. Don't get me wrong, I love french fries, I love gravy, and I love cheese curds, but the poutine here kind of ruined it for me. My expectation of poutine was high but it got shot down. For the rest of my time in Canada (a week), we didn't try poutine again. 

The Cole's original french dip was just bland.

Before leaving Canada, we thought many times about returning to Lamplighter for the awesome shrimp dumplings but we never made our way back to Gastown.",2014-07-12T23:37:42Z,268

The food is 20% overpriced.  The drinks, particularly a whiskey sour, taste murky and terrible... 50% overpriced (shouldn't be served at all, really).

Asked why and the girl said ""because there's a DJ"" and I asked where and she responded ""he's here at 10."" Okay, not the strongest argument but I have to eat.  I told her ""but I'm literally eating a burger and leaving"" and she claims that everyone who eats here gets charged for cover??? Whatever. I pay, and join my friends on my patio and the server comes and asks me what I want to drink and I ask if I can order food and she tells me that the patio is closing in 20 minutes ??¿??¿so my friends settled and I paid for cover to use the washroom I guess. Heard this place is fun but getting charged cover to eat a sandwich in a nearly empty pub has left a pretty sour taste in my mouth.",2015-06-06T04:54:18Z,268
656,The Lamplighter Public House,3.1,"We went here because the wait at our first choice restaurant nearby was too long. We were pleased with the food we ordered. The pretzel appetizer was delicious. I ordered the fish tacos, which were very yummy. Weirdly, these normally come with mayonnaise, which I've never heard of on fish tacos before. But it was easy to order without. My husband had the veggie burger with the rosemary fries and all of it was delicious. They have a great beer selection too. We had trouble narrowing down our choices. We left feeling satisfied with our meal.

Two downsides to this place. For one, it's quite dark inside unless you're sitting near a window. If it's a nice sunny day outside, I don't like to be sitting in the dark. The other thing is that they play the music WAY WAY WAY too loud. I'm not some old fuddy-duddy, but I do like to hear what my dinner companion is saying. It felt like I was in a club.",2016-07-24T14:39:46Z,268

It has been the only bar that can gave me/understood what a lime top up was! (It's a British thing...but oh soooo good).

We got caught up with some American Football and eating some delicious fries.

There wasn't much of a crowd, however, the few people that were in there were there primarily to watch the game.

They had a variety of beers as well as a full bar.  The cosmopolitan I had was very small and not much to it.  

The service was good and they tended to every need without prompting.

All in all a good place to hang out and enjoy the game.",2011-09-21T02:11:34Z,268

They've removed the pool tables and replaced the stage with a DJ stand, and the furniture is now darker and more modern looking, but it was still pints of Canadian on special here on a recent Friday night. We must have been there too early, because the place was pretty much dead and we had to try to talk over the baseball game playing on about a zillion TVs all over the bar.

There was a handful of people there but it was on the quiet side. The vibe is very casual with big TVs and some games. I found it a little boring but our waitress was very nice and friendly. A couple people in the bar gave us some ideas of where to head out next, which is always appreciated. Overall I'd say to drop in for a low-key drink or two with a group of friends before going out to other bars or clubs, or if you just want a chill evening. It also looks like a good place to hangout if you want to watch a game on tv.",2018-04-19T18:35:57Z,268

Sometimes they might not even have a scheduled UFC fight on one of their many screens, but every-time i've ask one of the waitresses that's serving me and my table if they can put on the UFC, they don't even hesitate. I did notice that they do reservations for PPV which is nice if you have a big group

Moving onto the drinks

The Lamp Lighters Caesars are weird because they put a cucumber in them and personally i like kick in my Caesar and in my opinion the cucumber doesn't compliment the drink well because its a very mellow flavor. Maybe many people like the cucumber and the Caesar but i'm not one of them.

Foods typical pub food. I've only orders the turkey club, sometimes the sandwich has been dry but the side salad that comes with it always impresses me",2016-11-19T03:27:21Z,268

The beer specials can be good deals.  Even though it looks fairly big from the outside (at least to me), on the inside, there wasn't as much seating as I would have expected.  Those pinball machines take up a lot of space.

Vibe was that of a standard pub, service was great, we ordered the fish and chips and the nachos. The nachos are definitely meant to be shared, 3-4 people easily could enjoy it as an appetizer. The fish and chips offered a good size piece of cod and a ton of fries. Would definitely recommend for the environment and the food!",2017-07-30T04:30:58Z,268

I don't like the obligatory charge because no matter how bad the service is, we have to pay. And yes, it happened that the service was bad. The waitress was around somewhat but the bigger problem was that everyone in our group got thier food at different times and some of us waited over 40 mins so half of the group had already eaten thier meal by then. Plus, my meal (kimchi grilled cheese) smelled off (I eat kimchi all the time so it was not me being unfamiliar) but I ate it anyway since I didn't want to wait another 40 mins for something else but wow, did I pay the price this morning and woke up with sharp tummy pains then I proceeded to crap my guts out. Needless to say, I will never go back there. Recommendation to others: don't expect much for your money and don't ever eat that kimichi grilled cheese!",2020-03-04T17:14:49Z,268

1. This
2. Place
3. Sucks
4. Major
5. Balls....ughhhhhh *barf*

I came here on a Friday night around 11ish and felt troubled by the fact that the bouncer wouldn't let people in yet from peeking into the entrance, it was obvious that nobody was inside. It sucked even more that my friends ahead of me in line paid half of what my girlfriend and I got charged. Lame...ness.

Once we entered, we were magically transported into a word of beauty; and by ""beauty"" I mean seizure-inducing ""sausage-fest"". 
- For one, there was barely anyone inside. Maybe 30 at most.
- Secondly, 99% were nerdy Asian dudes leaning against the bar desperately waiting for jail bait. 
- Thirdly, it was more rowdy and fun OUTSIDE the club. Everyone just stood outside but none of which went INSIDE.
- Lastly, the familiar disco lights/lasers here made this club look a lot like the back section of a novelty store (eg. Spencers); GAWD I wish I could get my $20 back because I could just buy my own strobe light then start my own club in the alley of a liquor store.

673,Au Bar,2.3,"This place is not a club it's a sess pool of grossness. This is a review for an incident that happened over a year ago but I doubt this black hole is any better now.

I admit I hate clubbing but, I like dancing. But more than hating clubbing I hate being harassed in clubs. Au Bar takes harassment to a whole new level.

We came here for my friends birthday, and the bouncer was no where to be seen. Guys tried to grope us, and grind with us  even after being repeatedly told to buzz off. For the first time ever I had to slap someone, and my friend had to slug someone because where were the bouncers?! I get it some guys want to pick up chicks but if I say NO I damn well mean NO. Don't try to put your hands down someones shirt or pants. Don't be a dumb ass!

The problem with Au Bar is that it's over run with people who are simply dicks and probably have no lives, and come here night after night. I came here to celebrate my friends birthday but, our group was harassed to point where the majority of us left early. I did not have a good time. I tried to because, it was my friends birthday but it's hard to be impressed or enjoy yourself when guys keep coming up behind up trying to feel you up, or put their hand down your front as you you push them away. Not just once either, this was happening all night.

I just wanted to dance with my friends! Yet, Au Bar was the worst club ever. Overpriced, not fun, and a bad crowd. Even if a friend invited me here for a birthday I would decline, it was THAT bad. My friend apologized for even having her birthday here. Yes, it was that bad of a experience.

674,Au Bar,2.3,"I've only been here twice; both times I've been were on a Friday evening - the music is amazeballs on Friday nights. I wouldn't know if it's the same during the other evenings. But I can tell you you're going to have fun on a Friday evening.

Thursdays are usually International Student nights, so there's always a long line up on Thursday evenings. 

Cover and drinks are pricey; It was $16 something to get in. To be honest though some clubs charge $20 for cover, so in comparison to that I guess it's not as bad.

I like the interior, quite nice. Although the dance floor is quite small. How about reducing the number of lounge areas, areas that no one can even access because there are stanchions prohibiting people to sit their tired a** down. I understand they need to make money off of those VIP lounges, but barely anyone occupied any of those lounges.

Would I go back? Uhhhh.... maybe? I'd probably recommend it to people who have never been, but I myself won't say ""Let's go to AuBar!!!""; although I won't be opposed if my friends say they want to go.",2012-03-25T06:15:28Z,17

After a long chat with the manager we checked some coats, what mean less money in our pockets for nothing and was really cold inside.
Then we tried to buy their OVERPRICED drinks but the bartender pretended not to understand what we asked to charge more! Absurd! ... we asked the security and they expelled us from the club!!!! all of it in 15 minutes!

$8 for a 25ml shot of Fireball

677,Au Bar,2.3,"AU BAR IS DEFINITELY THE WORST CLUB WE HAVE BEEN IN VANCOUVER.

IF YOU DONT WANT TO RISK TO HAVE YOUR NIGHT RUINED DO NOT GO TO AU BAR!

Starting on the entrance, after you pay to get in, a security DEMAND you to take out your jacket or coat and leave it in their closet, and you have to pay for it. $4 each in our case. If you are not comfortable with that.. well they DON'T care! THEY WILL ASK YOU TO LEAVE IF YOU DONT AGREE.
They were EXTREMELY rude when we asked to stay with our jackets on. If you are lucky you can stay with your sweater but inside is not warm at all.

Both the Staffs and the Manager are TOTALLY unprepared to deal with customers! It surprised me how BAD they treat us and also other people that we've seen and how POORLY they try to solve a big problems. ESPECIALLY WITH INTERNATIONAL PEOPLE, EVEN IF YOU SPEAK ENGLISH WELL.

Some guy on the bar was RIDICULOUSLY rude when we asked for our change back ($5.50). Each one of us asked for ONE drink and we were paying separate, being very specific about that. He took the money and didnt give back the right change. After we talked to him, and he didnt want to cooperate he looked to us and said ""THIS IS NOT HOW YOU ORDER IN CANADA"" (pretending that we  didnt asked to pay separate)
After discussing, when the manager arrived, he PRETENDED we were causing the trouble.
The guy got angry and got out of the bar VERY AGGRESSIVELY and THREATENED us to leave or he was going to beat us, in front of everybody and the security didnt do anything to stop him. Our friends who told him to back off.
Probably he reacted like this because hes not used to have people standing out for their rights and wanted to make a show to intimidate us.

We talked to the manager outside about what happened and he just tried to make the easiest way out for them, he heard what we said at first and apologized, after that he act like he didnt care about us and if we'd go away or not. So basically there is no one to help you in case you really need.

We've been in Canada for more then 2 years and we are around 25 to 30 years old.
So far this was the WORST night and the WORST club that we've been in Vancouver.

693,Library Square,2.5,"Came by with a friend yesterday to watch the 'Jays game and catch up.

I arrived around 1PM to find the place empty, but for my friend sitting at a booth.  During our stay it filled up a little, but was no more than one-quarter full by the time we left several hours later.  This might have had something to do with the crazy 100km/h winds and rain outside - just an educated guess!

He ordered the butternut squash soup, and I had the chicken tortilla soup.  I would highly recommend the latter.  Presentation was excellent, and temperature perfect.  Both the large bowl the soup was in and the plate underneath were pre-warmed, and the soup was really filling.  Just what the doctor ordered!  If I had one minor complaint, it would be that there was not much cilantro.  Taste and variety of flavours in the soup were great - from the little tortilla pieces to bits of avocado and sour cream.

Our server was prompt in taking our orders and refilling our waters every so often.  I think she knew we were staying for the game, and didn't come over to upsell, which we both appreciated.  My friend ordered a beer which came promptly.

As for the atmosphere, it was a little lacking.  I'll give them a pass for being empty based on the weather outside.  They have lots of screens and sound, although a few of the massive screens are from projectors.  Our booth seats were comfortable, though I must say the temperature in the restaurant was on the cooler side.  Throughout my stay I found it drafty, with no heating to be found at all.  Something they should definitely look into, as I think we're in for a cold winter!

Location is good - right beside the central library as you might expect.  Bike storage right around the corner, and some street parking for those who are persistent.  Within a stone's throw of Roger's Arena/BC Place.

I would come back but probably stick to the soup, and would try sitting in a different area to see if it's any warmer.  They are part of the Donnelly group, and their menu is priced similar to that of Joey's/Cactus/Earl's.  I'd be curious to see what their happy hour menu looks like as well.",2016-10-17T07:38:01Z,204
694,Library Square,2.5,"Library Square Public is located downtown Vancouver, which is two blocks from Rogers Arena and BC Place, and across the street from the Queen Elizabeth Theatre. The location is outside the library, is very easy to find, but it's hard to park the car.

I have been to Vancouver Public Library a lot, but I have never been to this place since this year my birthday. My fiance had dinner with the meetup group once and he brought me some leftover chicken wings, which was awesome. So, we decided to have my pre-birthday dinner there with friends.

Environment: Since it was Wednesday night (Wings Night), we made a reservation before we came. 6 people for 6pm. We arrived on time. This place was not too busy. Inside the Library is like normal bars. Dark inside, Big screen TV, Calm inside, perfect conditions for me.

Service: since it's a little bit busy, we had to wait for a while to begin the order. The server is nice and friendly. I don't think they have many servers working that night. Every time we wanted something, we had to wait for a while.

Food: Because of Wings night, we all ordered Wings special. Actually, this place had horrible Wings selection. There are only three flavors for Chicken Wings: Salt peppers, Sweet Chili and Hot. If you don't like spicy, your only option is Salt Peppers. We ordered all three to share. The chicken wings came out of the kitchen for a while, but they are well cooked, well seasoning and fresh hot. The most important thing is they are all very big, bigger than many other pubs or bars downtown Vancouver, which is awesome. After ate the first round chicken wings, my friends decided to order some french fries. We ordered regular fries and jalapeno cheese fries. The taste of fries is awesome, especially the jalapeno cheese fries.

Prices: Even though it's wings special, this place still charge Chicken wings like $6 or $7. The fries are the same. It's very pricy. The taste was great. It's more important.

In summary, it's not bad. We enjoyed our wings night at Library Square. Good experience.",2019-06-02T17:15:59Z,204

So although she was nice she was not on the ball.

The food was pretty good.  Well I ordered nachos, which I love, and want, always!  These nachos were pretty damn tasty.  I really enjoyed them, even though my sisters had way way way more black olives than mine.

The music is good, and there's a juke box, which is always fun!  
The ambiance is what you expect, very casual, wooden everything.  

I would definitely come back...for those nachos.",2018-07-10T04:12:16Z,204

Their service was attentive, but not overbearing. We were posted up for 4 hours, and only rang up a bill of $40. The staff checked in with us multiple times and made an effort to make sure we had everything we needed without pressuring us to order more.

699,Library Square,2.5,"I looooove me Mostly I love me some nachos with lots of toppings because if I wanted to eat a bag of tortilla chips I`d hit the grocery store not the local pub. i work in Library Square so naturally I had to check the pub out. 

The Nachos were AWESOME! tons of cheese, fresh jalapenos. Tasy guacamole (which no extra charge for once!) 

The waitress was friendly and helpful. I had a two for one coupon, and she didn`t get all lame after she knew I had it like most servers do. She even suggested we fill out the service questionaire so that we could get a free ten buck gift card mailed out to us! AWESSSSSOME I love free food dollars. 

The decor is pretty normal for a pub, just reminded me of a cactus or earls so nothing to over the top.

I recommend it for a lunch break, although be prepard to spend a few dollars becasue the menu isn`t exactly cheap.",2012-05-07T03:30:50Z,204

701,Library Square,2.5,"There's something satisfying about sipping wine in the shadow of the coliseum-esque Public Library.

This spot is a bit of a chameleon: I've enjoyed a quick lunch here, after-work drinks, as well as late-night clubbing. Yes, all in the same spot. I like the crowd that the Library Square Public House attracts. It's less overrun than venues on the Granville strip but enough people go to still make it a fun night out.

Service can be a bit hit-or-miss, but there is generally a good selection of beers on tap. During game season, I fear, the bar can use its morphing skills to become too much of a sports bar for my liking. Personally, I find TVs buzzing in every corner distracting and it splinters the social atmosphere of drinks with friends.

One vote here to turn off the tube, please.",2008-11-19T20:45:36Z,204

Donnelly, congratulations: you've made another Vancouveresque Cookie-Cutter pub! Chalk up everything to do with Donnelly to good advertising.  They'd be nothing without their artificially inflated 'hype'.

Expensive-tasteless food, expensive barely beyond well drinks and ignorant door-staff.  I'd love it if the management cracked a whip on the clowns that work outside these places. Their position is not a 'power-trip' they're to ensure there are no weapons entering the bar and they don't go over capacity.  THIS IS NOT A PICK-UP BAR, so your half attempt at face-control is in vain! Go back to school and find a job that pays more than $10 per hour if all you're interested in is power.....",2010-06-29T23:53:32Z,204

705,Library Square,2.5,"I am torn on this review. I watched the Canada/Swiss hockey match here and had a blast. The place was full of people, a great environment to watch, plus a lot of great looking women. The wait staff was incredibly good looking and fun to chat with - plus Budweiser girls were passing out free beers.

The problems...cover charges that vary with the time, pitchers of beer at $19, and single beers at $8.50. From what all the guys said when I went - Library Square Public House was raising their prices during the Olympics which is pretty lame. I understand making money, but I definitely couldn't afford more than one or two pitchers.

708,Library Square,2.5,"Ended up here because the actual Vancouver Public Library Central Branch (which this restaurant is attracted to) was undergoing an emergency as the fire alarm was set off and everyone exited the library. So I figured I'd get some coding done on a website I'm working on while having a couple drinks. 

Seems to be a pleasant venue with friendly staff however if you're working while having dinner or drinks be attentive when paying your bill. 

First, their portable POS terminal wasn't connecting so I was unable to pay via credit or debit. I sense this is nothing new to this establishment as I saw an ATM next to the bar. I imagine the fees on that is $3 or more not including what your bank would charge you. Good think I always carry cash with me. 

Anyways, I made my payment with cash and the waitress said she'd be back with my change. Well she came back with my change but no receipt. Ok... so what's the big deal, no receipt. For those who run a business or have expenses that your company agrees to reimburse you know why receipts are important. 

So upon leaving I ask my waitress for a receipt as I hand her my bill. She states, ""That is your receipt!""

""No. That's my bill.  I would like a receipt showing this has been paid!"", I replied. 

""Well, you paid with cash"", was her response. 

With a puzzled face, ""ok... I still need a receipt stating I paid this bill"", I replied. 

She turns to what I suspect was a team lead or manager where this other lady turns and prints out a receipt for me stating PAID. 

Overall, great location, clean atmosphere, friendly staff. Food... nothing to brag about, and bill payment time; I'd suggest bringing cash & if on business while there, don't get fooled that your bill is your receipt.",2017-05-02T23:01:16Z,204
709,Library Square,2.5,"We had gone to Whistler earlier in the day, and after battling traffic on the way back, particularly on the roads leading up to the Lions Gate Bridge, elected to have dinner at a so-so taqueria on Davies Street. After that experience, I had the need to stretch my legs, so I circumnavigated Downtown Vancouver, including walking around the two arenas.

By this time I was really craving a drink (the taqueria failed to offer any). Fortunately I wound up at this place. While it wasn't that busy, I took to the place quickly due to its robust beer selection and wide variety of sport options on the tellies. The bartender engaged me into a long discussion about how the Great American Desert extends into the eastern portion of British Columbia... exactly the reason why humans require socialization - they pick up (and distribute) interesting thoughts and information. 

Regrettably I don't live in the area, but when I'm back, I'll be sure to enjoy a pint or three here, in addition to extending my soaking-in-the-atmosphere by having dinner as well.",2019-09-28T01:35:21Z,204

That said it can get boisterous, but it's all part of what makes the place lively even when it's roomy. Was in a couple of weeks for lunch, meeting an old friend for lunch and a chat. One could easily find a corner where conversation could be had. The food is always dependable. Their breakfast/brunch items are ambitious, though their lunch fare (on a weekday) is hardly exciting (standard, reliable fare here), it is well-made, and tastes quite good. The stairs throughout might be a bit confusing to some; you walk in off the street down some steps and up to get to the booths. Good, attentive service always.",2019-09-06T08:58:06Z,204
711,Library Square,2.5,"The Library Square Public House is located right by Vancouver's Central Library so it's definitely convenient if you have plans in the area. I came here during happy hour before going to the library to do some work. It's an interesting model of having a pub so close to the library, but at least the inside is big a relatively spacious. 

Service is pretty slow so don't expect anyone to come to you anytime soon. We basically sat ourselves down and got our own menus before someone decided to follow up with us. I picked up a $4.00 high ball and a $5 plate of patatas bravas from the Happy Hour menu. Drink was pretty small but the patatas bravas were pretty good - definitely not a big portion either but it was tasty.

Overall, there's definitely the element of convenience of coming here but I wouldn't say the food or service is anything special.",2017-09-18T06:27:03Z,204
712,Library Square,2.5,"After seeing the mixed reviews I was a little skeptical about coming to Library Square, but decided to go along with a few friends anyways. It was still fairly early, maybe about 6pm on a Sunday so they weren't too busy but still had a crowd.

We ended up sitting up at the bar as I was the only one ordering food with our drinks. There was a really funny and friendly bartender named Don that took care of us for the rest of the evening. Now I was pretty hu gry at the time because I had just finished a workout so the only thing on my mind was getting some protein in but I wanted quality. 

They had a sausage platter that caught my eye, you had the choice of 2 sausages and 2 dips with a side of fries and a small portion of kimchi. The sausages were extremely juicy which I loved, and paired well surprisingly with the kimchi which I would rarely ever eat on its own.

Overall I had a great experience at Library Square, especially with the exceptional service we received. Will be sure to check it out later at night when the DJ is playing music.",2016-07-29T23:52:07Z,204
713,Library Square,2.5,"Went here on a Friday night for Throwback night and it was great! We got there just before 11 and weren't charged anything for cover which was a pleasant surprise. Not sure if this was because we were there early or because we were 3 girls, but nice either way! 

The dance floor was relatively small but the music was oh-so-good. Exactly what we wanted for a throwback because they were mostly hits from the late 90's or early 2000's. The only negative experience I had here was being charged almost $12 for one Amaretto Sour which seemed ridiculous to me so I don't recommend getting lots of drinks unless you have major moola to spend. 

Overall a pretty great place and I definitely want to see what type of music they play on other nights!",2016-09-03T23:49:09Z,204

The happy hour prices were really good, so our table got a few beers. My drink was  good- I don't remember what it was called but the presentation was nice and it tasted yummy. The food was average- I would say it's definitely more a place to go for drinking. Both times I've driven up to Vancouver in the past year I've been to Library Square during the day to drink with friends.

I had fish and chips and he had a burger and honestly both were great. We had a couple rounds of beers and the place was otherwise fairly empty.  We knew a Canucks game was on that night (4 hours later) and wanted to just grab a bite before it got too crazy in there.

We had an entertainment book coupon which I told our server about when we got there, and when we went to pay the drama began.

She grabbed the coupon and came back about 10 min later and said she couldn't honour it because there was a hockey game on. I pointed out the coup said ""not valid during hockey games"" which I agreed was fair but that there was in fact no hockey game on. She argued with me, and then the manager came and argued with me about it too.  Eventually they conceded that I was right and that in fact it was not during a game, but let me just say this:

Y'all make a shit ton of money and you were the ones who decided to put coupons out there to begin with. So don't argue with your customer when they go to collect on it.  After all you're just writing off a maximum of $14.",2014-12-16T06:38:16Z,204

726,Library Square,2.5,"This review is for the food we had this past weekend.

Have been here a number of times.  Always before a game or concert.  Great place to have a couple and meet up with others.  Sports fans also love the number of TV's.  Service and drinks always above average.

Was here the other night for a big gathering of friends before we moved on to other spots.  First time I have ever ordered food.  With over 20 of us, I got to see quite a number of plates from the kitchen.  All of us are over 200 lbs and 40+ years old.  We've been around and know about food.

No one raved about their order.  My $18 burger............that's right $18 was a huge disappointment.  It was the special.  Big deal.  They added a slice of deli meat and caramelized onions.  It was the smallest burger I've had in a long time.  Tasted good.  I'll give them that.

I'll keep coming here as it's a great spot when meeting up before a game or going to the QE.  I'll just keep my expectations lower when ordering off the food menu.",2017-07-17T14:18:46Z,204

729,Library Square,2.5,"APPARENTLY it's okay to start turning fans away of a specific team because management decided on THE DAY OF THE FINAL to support the opposing team. Customers wearing Liverpool jerseys had to wear T-shirts on top because the club was a Spurs pub for the day...literally refused entry because of wearing an opposing team's jersey to avoid fights apparently. Discriminatory. 

FIRST OF ALL avoid fights?! MAYBE if you hadn't made it an all Spurs fans day then you'd be like every other pub with a mix of fans of both. THE BEAUTIFUL GAME IS SUPPOSED TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER NOT SEGREGATE BASED ON TEAMS. Also it's Vancouver and we are adults. Get some fucking security if you're so worried.

SECOND OF ALL our reservation was made 3 weeks in advance specifically to avoid running around looking for a place. Called an hour before to confirm reservation and they STILL didn't mention no opposing team jerseys. 

THIRD OF ALL this is the city's home ARSENAL pub...Spurs' rivals....just...what. I mean I'm all for solidarity clearly, which is exactly why I thought it should be perfectly fine to watch here. But what the actual hell.

Note that if you're planning on using your Entertainment coupon, it can't be an 'event' night - but an event night is at management's discretion.

738,Library Square,2.5,"I wanted to update my review after we were invited back by the manager Lewis to try their dinner menu. He was genuinely professional with an eagerness to improve on their food service. I feel that my original 3 star rating still stands accurate and fair. There is still room for improvement if they want to draw a crowd in beyond their popular 90's night and bar scene. 

A few bumps during our visit that could still use some improvement include:
- Not having a fully stocked bar. It wasn't until my third attempt at ordering a drink that they had all the ingredients to make it.
- Not having the fight showing on their TVs that night like they originally thought. I guess they share PPV with other Donnelly Group establishments, and they were SOL that night. 
- Other than the Vietnamese short ribs that we ordered, the food and menu could still use some work. The salmon dish we had was a bit too greasy and some of the vegetables were still raw. 

Overall, the menu still needs some work if their focus wants to be about the food. Table service has always been good (our server that night was fantastic!) but I have had VERY bad experiences with the bartenders during 90's night before. We appreciate the invitation and the efforts and look forward to see the new improvements in the future.",2015-12-01T17:55:55Z,204
739,Library Square,2.5,"Ah..what happened here? I would've drop this place down to two stars, but the staff where it counts here are still incredible. I think it has more to do with management.

Bouncers have still got to be some of the nicest in town. How often do you get a heartfelt ""Thanks for coming out tonight?"" from a bouncer? and from  one dude (the bouncer) to another (me).  However maybe it's because they know how much this place has slipped and are thankful you made it out to Library Square and thus ensuring their employment for another while longer.

The bartenders are attentive and serve quickly and efficiently.  My big miff with this place is how it went from a path towards being a good venue for some decent food by day to a venue for listening to some decent music and hosting some kickin after parties for concerts...to...a place that houses just out of high school kids that are out for the first time now that they're finally legal.

It's not even the bad I'm trying to hard crowd, it's the: let's stand around and do nothing crowd. Poor DJ, poor waiters and waitresses.  Can't blame them too much for not trying.  Kids who just stand around on the dance floor are going to make any DJ look like crap.  Kids who can't afford more than an appetizer are going to tip like crap for the wait staff.

Management with the inclusion of arcade/pinball machines and the little minor tweaks has definitely made this feel more like a SUB (Student Union Building) hang out more than anything else.

Menu has about 4 items on it and the tvs are super loud.
When we finally ordered, we waited about an hour for our food to come, during which time we saw numerous tables that had arrived after us get served.

Now we all know that servers make mistakes- maybe she forgot to put our order in, but she would look at us and walk away. Not even once coming to say 'sorry for the long wait' or 'oops'. She literally avoided our table.

Finally the manager (I think) came round and said our food would be out momentarily. Yeah, like another 15 minutes. When he brought it, I said you know we've been waiting for about an hour. He actually said 'no I didn't know, but I do now.' And he walked away. That was it.

Service is always good and they get you out at a reasonable pace.  I like the food and the specials for drinks and food are good too.  I'd go here before a Canucks game if it makes sense.",2010-08-15T21:56:54Z,204
743,Library Square,2.5,"I've stopped by for after work drinks several times, and find the place nearly empty to mildly filled.  Never busting at the seams- until I went on a game night.  There was a string of people waiting outside to be seated.  I ended up going somewhere else.  Library Square Pub is good and consistent, but it's not worth waiting in the cold.  They have a good drink selection, and reasonable prices.  But there's 5 other places with a 2 block radius that can match this.

The TVs are large, and this is definitely a good place to catch the game.  Service is inconsistent.  The emptier it is, the less I see of the wait staff.  But I do like the low lighting and little lights on the table.  They have an outside patio (but it's on the shady side of the library- so I'm not a huge fan).",2008-11-26T07:24:18Z,204

All I can say is that the service was very prompt for food, the nachos plate was MASSIVE and tasty enough. The ladies serving were friendly. 
I guess it's like my old school; the building and people running it were fine, just the people populating it were a bit suspect.

747,Library Square,2.5,"If I do come here it's usually for 90s night. This pub turns into a nightclub and purely because of 90s night it gets a second star.

From my past experiences, unless you have to, I wouldn't recommend the food here. The quality does not live up to the price. 

Anyway was here earlier while pub hopping. I recognize it was rather busy as it was a Friday evening and many people were there prior to heading to the concert at Rogers Arena. 

We sat ourselves at the only table left. Although a server removed the drinks off the table a few minutes after we sat down, she never greeted us or bothered cleaning the table. It was a good 15 to 20 minutes before a server took our drink orders. Good thing the server let us know that the bar was backed up cause it would be another 15 minutes before the drinks would arrive. 

The two star rating is purely based on all my experiences here, including tonight. It's a decent place for groups and they do have a nice projector screen now, but I'll probably be pub hopping elsewhere.. unless I'm here for 90s night.",2015-05-16T06:22:08Z,204

Maybe they were in her section before, but she was pretty adamant to serve and flirt with them rather than address the full row of people playing games. Fair enough. 
Telling her that the woman's washrooms were flatulantly sprayed with diarrhea was ineffective and I felt brushed off. 
My friends attempt at further telling the bartender about the absurd health risk and was received with a hand gesture brushing her off and a 'yeah-yeah'

The server took a while to take our orders, but that doesn't usually bother me as long as the service afterwards is fine, and it definitely was in our case.

I decided to order the burger even though it was $19. I figured it would be more worth it, to pay that much for a burger that appealed to me, rather than spend $16 for a sandwich that seemed mediocre. 

The burger was totally NOT worth it. I am pretty sure that's the most that I've ever spent on a burger, and I will never make that same mistake again. The burger came with two patties, cheese, mushrooms, onion rings, and side fries. I upgraded their regular fries to rosemary and garlic fries, however, these completely lacked garlic flavor. I am more than disappointed with this restaurant.

755,Library Square,2.5,"Now... ya'll know that i'm not one for the 1-2 star reviews. This is mainly because I have developed a deep distaste for signing in only to read angst ridden excuses masquerading as 'reasons' from business owners who seem to view my review as the sole cause of their recent decrease in business. WOULD that I wielded this much power! Anyways, point being... I have my reasons for this poor review and I will list them thrice: 

1. Headed here on a Sat night for Canucks vs. Red Wings home game. Uhh, numbered 1 and 2 in the league (respectively of course) so this was a biggie to say the least! Had to ask the manager to switch the sound on as we watched the anthems in silence as well as the puck drop. I f-ing love watching/HEARING Mark Donnelly (big guy who sings at home games) belt out O'Canada so this was really enough to annoy me pretty substantially. 

2. Some football game was on on half the tv's. (i'm a hockey girl, maybe it was an important game- I wouldn't know) Can't have been pleasing for the folk watching football to have to listen to the Canucks game while watching football in silence. 

3. Manager switched the sound off during intermissions and started playing crappy no-name house music circa 2006. I'm pretty sure that the 3/4 of the bar actively watching the game was, like me, curious to hear what Ron had to say! 

4. The chicken wings which rang in at a whooping $11 were sinewy and over $1 a piece. ie: only 8-9 wings all told. 

5. Pool table was squished into too small a space requiring some poor girl to ask one or the other of our party sitting at the upstairs stools to move every time it was her turn. 

Ok, so that's well over three reasons... overall, LS seems to be trying to please way too many divergent groups at once and is failing at impressing anyone in the process.

Also, honestly! You're a bar three blocks from Rogers Arena! Gear up for home games! This is Canada, yo!",2011-01-17T21:00:52Z,204
756,Library Square,2.5,"Weak. 

I don't really care for the crowd, and I don't really care for the 80's hits like ""I wanna dance with somebody"" and ""girls just wanna have fun"" that have been mercilessly beat to death on the sound system here every weekend. Not only that, but I came out to support my friends doing a guest DJ spot and apparently the management felt their music was ""too dark"" and didn't even let them play their last set. LAME. 

If you are still watching reruns of pop-up-video on Much Music and think that ""Friday I'm in Love"" is really underground, you might enjoy this place. If you like paying $12 cover for a night at a Donnellybar be my guest, but you might as well hit up Granville on a weekend - you're gonna get the same tarted up hussies and bulked up douchebags that are DTF.",2012-08-09T17:20:43Z,204
757,Library Square,2.5,"Last night my group and I were very disappointed with the false advertising about the St Patrick's 'party' at Library Square.   DHM advertised a special menu, samples, tastings, prizes and a live band from 3pm - 2am.  Being a week night, we came after work, and had a few hours to celebrate St.Paddy's before heading home. By 7pm, the place was packed (no tables left), but the special event hadn't started so we ordered food and bevy's and waited.  And waited.  At 10pm the band finally started, but played a very short set.  By 11pm, we had to head home, and felt like we'd wasted our St Patricks at the wrong place.  Really disappointing (I'm huge fan of St Paddys).  If the advertising had been more truthful, I would have gone somewhere that was actually throwing a party.

On the funny/crazy/stupid side, the washrooms were GROSS.  The floors were covered in water, but here's why:  the automatic hand dryers (women's and mens) are super high-powered and motion censored... and placed RIGHT ABOVE the sink.  You can imagine, that when one is washing their hands, they get the shock of their life when this super jet blows water into the running sink, blowing water and soap everywhere.  Good for a laugh though...  Bring your cam : )",2010-03-18T23:22:39Z,204
758,Library Square,2.5,"A one star! It has been a while. But they do deserve that star.

The Positive:

The staff at Library Square Public House are fantastic. I have a sneaky suspicion it's the reason I also give this place a very bad review. But if you want top notch friendly staff who treat you like a friend of their's, this is the place.

The Negative:

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$...I think you get the point. I went on 90's night. The most positively reviewed night. First off, the DJ didn't really focus on popular 90's music. That was strange. But the biggest reason this place is a let-down is $12 cover and $3 coat check. After that, I just don't feel like tipping. Tipping coat check staff in the first place is like giving a tip to someone sitting on the couch and doing nothing. Sure it's tough looking for those jacket's and I'm sure you face some unsavoury folk. BUT your job can be done by anyone who hasn't even a grade 3 education (no offence to children in grade 3). So I won't tip you because you have done nothing but look pretty and carry a snotty attitude. Actually that was one girl there. The other one was extremely friendly. Sooo not all coat check girls are like that.

So after spending a lot of money just to get in (I didn't even mention the pretentious and unnecessary line-up because it was empty inside), I was hoping the night would be amazing. It was not. In fact it was a huge disappointment. My friends were hilarious. But the bar is typical, drinks normal and there was nothing impressive about the atmosphere. The guy/girl ratio was quite off and this was very much a ""guys"" bar. A lot of testosterone floating around. 

All-in-all I won't be back here. I felt ripped off for a below average bar. You pay for pretension and a lack of entertainment.

Note: Normally I write funny. But this place just had nothing funny to write about. There was a foosball table which was awesome! You needed a staff member to come by and unlock it every time you wanted to play...but..okay I'm done.lol",2012-04-09T00:26:30Z,204

Sure, that makes me sound like an old 'get off my lawn' lady, but everything about this situation is incongruous. I like to have a good time with some fine beverages as much as the next person (ask anyone), but this joint is a disappointment. I went with friends on a Wednesday evening (not dance club night or whatever) and it was so loud and service was slow and spotty (wrong beverages, inability to answer questions, server couldn't hear our orders) and it wasn't even busy. The whole place made me feel depressed.

On the plus side they have Driftwood Ale on tap and there are many giant tvs.

761,Library Square,2.5,"I was so excited to go here for Friday 90s night for my birthday, that I set up a guest list for myself and my friends (free cover before 11pm). We got there around 10pm, and the ""guest list"" line up was over an hour long wait. The hostess suggested we go to a nearby pub for an hour and come back, but pointed out that the free cover would no longer apply then, and we'd still have to wait in line, but ""might not be as long"" then, even though she said there were several hundred people on the guest list. Meanwhile, a group of about 5 guys greased the bouncers and walked right in. 

My question is - what the hell is the point of the guest list if you can't get in? They allowed more people on it then they have capacity in the bar. I get that not everyone will show up, but they people that do are screwed. Unless, or course, you grease the bouncers $20.

Ended up going to another bar in Gastown, where we got right in and had a great time, but I have to say, I was so disappointed with this experience. On any other night it wouldn't have been that big of a deal, but when my whole bday was riding on a fun 90s night, it put a massive damper on the rest of the night, and some friends didn't even bother to come to the other bar. Donnelly Group head office reached out to me for my bday and offered this ""guest list"" for any of their places, so I was completely let down.

762,Library Square,2.5,"2 stars because my spring rolls tasted good. Not even close to being worth $8, but tasty none the less.

Last night were were going to a Christmas concert (TSO) at Roger's arena and had time for a quick appy and drinks. We wandered around the area a bit and decided on Library Square.

We found a seat right away near the Foosball table. At first our waitress seemed quick and attentive, but things steadily began to go downhill. 

We all ordered an appy/small plate at the exact same time as our drinks, so as to be speedy. Our drinks came out quickly, tasted good and we had some time for a Foosball game while we waited for our food. 3 of the 4 plates were brought out, leaving my boyfriend  waiting for his food. My friends started eating, and I picked at my spring rolls as he waited for his poutine. I figured our waitress was just making a couple of trips, but when she came back empty handed to check on us, I was concerned. We asked where his fries were and she just said ""they're coming."" It would have been nice if she'd apologized for the delay. It's rude to serve 3/4 of the table and leave someone without their food.

I excused myself to the bathroom, and figured his food would be there by the time I got back. Nope, but our bill was! It was messed up, so she changed it around a bit. Still didn't apologize that his food STILL hadn't come, even after I pointed it out a second or third time.

Finally the fries came and Shane had to scarf them down so that we wouldn't be late for our show.  We paid, opted not to leave a tip and decided not to return in the future.

If the kitchen messes up and forgets to make someones food, that's fine. Own up to it. The waitress is the ""ambassador"" for the kitchen, and they all work together to make up a team. The cook isn't going to come out and apologize for missing an order, so she kind of is expected to say something. If she had have just apologized for the delay and had a better, more polite attitude, we would have understood and not thought a thing of it. 

Sorry Library Square, but your food and drinks are overpriced, your staff is borderline rude. I'll be going somewhere else next time I'm in the area. I'm sure you won't miss me, as you and the other Donnelly public houses SOMEHOW rack in a lot of business despite your reputations.

767,Library Square,2.5,"I don't like giving one-star reviews. Look at my review history -really, I don't. But when a place ruins my birthday party, I think I have the right to review it as such.

Don't let the name fool you -the Library Square Public House isn't a place to come for a night of cerebral entertainment. My friend and I organized a joint birthday party for ourselves this year, and we decided to end our night with some dancing at the 90's night at Library Square. We had even spent our afternoon at thrift shops searching for the most hideous (yet hilarious) 90's outfits so that we could arrive in theme. Imagine our disappointment when we arrive at 10pm to find a line-up out the door filled with 19-20 year olds, all dressed in the same short, black mini-dress.

Let's be clear: this place is a meat market. While in line, there were girls in front of us who were trying to take pictures of themselves making out with each other so they could post it on facebook. It's THAT type of place. I'll admit, we were stupid enough to stand in line for an hour waiting to get in. Over the course of that time, our friends gradually dropped out one-by-one -this place was just too lame for them.

I'll admit: we left before we got in, but from what we could see, the inside was just packed with 19 year old bumpin' and grindin' with each other. A lot of the music they were playing wasn't even from the 90's! From past times being there, I can also warn others that the drinks are very over priced. I know it's not really a ""club"" drink, but a pint of Guinness is over $8, as a point of reference.

Overall, it's a Donnelly Group establishment, so I shouldn't have been surprised. The Donnelly Group is really good at serving up a pre-packaged idea of ""fun"" to stereotypical vapid suburbanites. Their establishments are NOT meant for the more creative-minded, quirky intellectual crowd. In the future, I'll stick to the more interesting venues in the city, such as the Waldorf, the Biltmore, or the newly-opened Electric Owl.

If you're a young 20-something Jersey Shore-esque male with a raging boner, or a fake-and-baked waif who feeds off of getting attention from men, go here. I'm sure you'll have fun.

At the end of the day, you know a place is bad if you have to send a message to your friends the next day apologizing about the epic fail that was your birthday party.

And then since when did pubs start having dance floors? 

I don't know, it's called a pub, but I really wasn't sure I was at one. A Plub I guess?

80's night seemed to be ridiculously lame. Half the songs weren't even from the 80's, and the 80's songs that they chose had very little dance appeal.

Food was extremely standard for a pub. 

I feel like this place has no interesting, original concepts that makes me say ""I want to go back there"". 

Also, a note on the service. Yes, I understand that at a very noisy, full establishment, it's easy to lose track of who's paid, but I certainly don't appreciate the waitress coming by every 10 minutes, reminding us that we can't leave our table to dance, until we've all paid up our food bills.

Came here on a Friday (90s night) and Saturday (80s night) and both days rocked my world!  I'm not big on bump'n'grind music so listening to the cheesy music I grew up to is awesome!!!

The Bads:
Cover is $10 and the dance floor is puny which means a lot of accidental elbow brushes and hair smacks.  Oh, and drinks are ridiculously expensive for a pub.

Management then told us the other party were VIPs and had special privileges. The kicker was that they didn't attempt to find us an alternative and seemed indifferent to us staying or going. Needless to say we moved on to another spot and likely won't be back anytime soon.

a) Library Square is the name of the bar on Georgia, not just the destination ON Robson IN FRONT of said (Public) Library
b)  that it was 80s night - I just thought the 'mac-dj' and bar were super cheesy but i was Mac-Loving that they played all my highschool fave's
c) that there was a UFC and Canucks game that night and apparently all the pawing drunk boys were the leftovers
d) i got totally gouged by the doorman to skip the line but the service from the bartenders and waitresses who kept the vodkas and iced waters flowing more than made up for him
e) there's no coat rack or coat check yet somehow all my (our) belongings managed to remain untouched, even unwatched for the duration of the evening

Knowing what I do now, would I go again? Uh, only if I was looking to repeat the 80s dance-off

P.S. to the guy who kept spinning me right round baby, right round like a record baby, right round, round, round...Dude, I like your style! but seriously, there's only so many spins around the dance floor one can muster. You need some new moves!",2009-03-10T05:53:15Z,204
778,Library Square,2.5,Over priced food and terribly slow service. Our server took our order and never stopped by other than that one time and it was extremely slow with few other people in the bar. Don't recommend going here if you're looking to eat or drink,2019-05-28T01:49:44Z,204
779,Library Square,2.5,"I came here for lunch on Friday and they have updated their lunch menus.  I really feel that this pub is trying their best to tweak their menus and cater to the specific class of workers around the area during lunch time.  

Their lunch menu consists of a very fresh variety of health conscious food.  A half order of roast beef, vegan, pastrami, or prosciutto sandwiches along with a side order of soup, salad or fries is all for $8.  There is more on the menu I did not mention, but all in all there is a good selection to choose from.  

I had the pressed hot pastrami sandwich and for a half order, it was tasty and satisfying.  The organic rye with Havarti and hot mustard topped off with fresh cut lettuce and tomato was made very well.  My sandwich didn't fall apart!

I had the signature soup which was wild mushroom soup and definitely isn't out of a can.

They are doing their best and I guess their lunch menu is the place to start.",2011-09-19T07:03:20Z,204
780,Library Square,2.5,"This place suffers from a major bout of schizophrenia - now what are you - a dance club, a neighbourhood bar, a sports bar.
Well I say pick one and do it right .... but this half ass attempt is not working for me.  

The drinks and food were on specials and its hard to fight a lb of wings for 5 loonies.  They were decent.  The salmon burger was OK but not worth the fifteen loonies it cost.  Service is friendly but a bit scattered.  The place is LOUD and it is hard to keep a conversation going.

So yes if you are into that Anne Heche - John Forbes Nash thing maybe it works for you...but me not so.",2010-06-09T23:29:06Z,204
781,Library Square,2.5,"The service was unfriendly and slow. 
The bathroom was crawling with cockroaches (not joking, they were all over the sink and counter) and stunk something fierce. 
The pulled pork sandwich gave me awful indigestion (and normally I love pulled pork). 
The bourbon I ordered (neat) was definitely watered down (the rest of my party confirmed my concern). 
The cocktails are watery and overly sweet. 
The floor was sticky. 

Beer list is decent. 

Donnelly Group doesn't have the best reputation, but this is by far one of the worst pubs/bars I've ever been to in Vancouver. Charging cover to get into a pub, let alone one this bad, seems odd to me. 

Aldo, cockroaches.",2013-09-17T06:51:58Z,204
782,Library Square,2.5,"Either I was having an off night or forgot to take off my invisibility cloak when walking in because I was ignored completely at the Library Square Pub. Came in, found a table, sat down, put on my best ""Gimme a menu, I'm starvin' over here"" face. A person with a nametag floated by. Looking in the other direction. 

She huddled with two others near the bar. Another one was dispatched to a table down the way. Carried a tray and menu. Things were looking up. And aaaah... missed again. Every TV in the bar tuned to the hockey game, a roar goes up with a shot on goal, and then the sound of disappointment as glasses slam on tables. Still nothing in front of me. 

Here comes a nametagger. She goes to the table next to mine, asks if the guy wants another beer. I wait for her to turn around. I've worked in restaurants; I'm not going to snap my fingers, or even interrupt. She simply walks away. What am I, a mirage? 

If they're this eager to serve me, I couldn't wait to see the disappearing act they'd do when it came time to bring the check. Oh wait. Yes I could. 

What's a sports bar doing next to a library, anyway? Aren't there zoning laws about this sort of thing?",2008-11-20T22:30:42Z,204
783,Library Square,2.5,"Library Square was once my favourite place in Vancouver - especially 90s Night on Friday. The 90s music combined with cheesy 90s movies and pinball machines made for a nostalgic good time, the staff was friendly, and some of my best Vancouver nightlife memories came from that place.

So last Friday, 4 of us went there looking forward to a night of drinks and dancing. Instead, we ended up standing in line outside for an hour and a half watching the most outstanding display of bouncer corruption we'd ever seen.

In that hour and a half, the bouncers let in 3 people from our line-up, telling us that they were full. However, we watched as:

a) Several girls in miniskirts and tube tops approached the bouncer, flirted with him, and got let in.
b) At least 20 of the bouncer's personal friends got let in.
c) Several guys were taken aside by the bouncer, who let them in after they slipped him $20 each.

Who do they think they are? It was just so blatant - they didn't even try to hide it! I've never felt so insulted (even at that theme restaurant in the States where the waiters are supposed to insult you).

I talked to 3 of my friends after this and they'd all had the same experience. So, goodbye Library Square, my old friend. Never going back there, or to any other Donnelly Pub. 

If you're in that area and looking for a fun place to go, walk around the corner to the Media Club. That's where we ended up - all the fun, none of the pretension!",2012-04-30T18:36:20Z,204

List of Machines:
Attack From Mars
Indiana Jones
Dr.Who
Lord of the Rings

Joker Poker

Took a big step up in the Pinball market, by adding a bunch of quality machines, plus they have a free tournament on Wednesday nights. It does get a bit hairy in there on a Friday or Saturday evening especially if there's a game on, but it could still be worth it. Not a big fan of the food, but that's not why I go.",2012-09-25T01:25:37Z,204
785,Library Square,2.5,Extremely rude and unresponsive service(our waitress seemed like she had eaten paint chips during her childhood only way to explain that blank soulless look in her eyes). Terrible burnt salmon burger and not so fantastic cocktail. Designed obviously as a tourist trap as they're not aiming for return customers. I do not recommend!,2016-04-06T12:18:54Z,204
786,Library Square,2.5,"I came here for 90's night. Yes, I love 90's R&B, but that is ALL THEY PLAYED. There are a lot more 90's songs than just R&B. Blah. Bland. Boring. Where was DJ Ana? All the young girls screaming when N'Sync came on really made me feel like punching them in the face. They were what.. 5 years old?
 
Also, I felt so old. I'm really not that old, but being around 19-25 year olds made me feel like I should have been hanging at a jazz club (which is probably where we should have gone). Where do all the older people go clubbing/dancing? Clearly not at Library Square.
 
The drinks were good though, so that's good?  And I still had a great time with my friends as we picked out all the drunken girls in all their short mini skirt dress whory glory. P.S. maybe it's because I'm practical, but girls why you be wearing 4 inch heels you can't even walk in? You look dizzumb.
 
I couldn't even get on the dance floor if I tried, it was so packed. I'd never go here again to dance, but maybe for a beer. Maybe. I don't know, I just don't understand.",2012-03-27T17:54:46Z,204
787,Library Square,2.5,"Had such a bad experience in here last night I wanted to vent.
Was meeting a friend and got there early, found a booth that had just been vacated and sat down. The waiter told me I could only sit there temporarily until he found me somewhere else to sit. I said fine and he brought me a beer. My friend arrived and we sat chatting; my beer was empty by now and the waitress wasn't coming any where near my table and the first guy never came back to relocate us. So my friend went to the bar and bought us both beers. Whilst he was at the bar, the waitress finally appeared.  I told her my buddy was at the bar which seemed to make her mad and wanted me to pay for the first beer I got upon arrival, and made a remark about us sitting at a booth that was for more than two people. I suggested that we could share as the place was filling up and there weren't many options for moving. 
Ten mins go by and she informs us we have to leave as some other people need the booth. By now, place was packed and no other place to sit, never mind eat as we had planned. Left my unfinished beer and hit the sidewalk looking for somewhere else to go.",2017-10-26T23:36:18Z,204
788,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"After a conference we tried this place.  D6 also participates in Dine-in Vancouver.  I had the set plate. Starter: Olives in oil. Nacho chips with salsa and guacamole.  My main was the pizza with arugula and mozzarella with Black Forest cake as dessert.  The main offered Beef Sliders instead of pizza. 

Verdict:  The olives were not pitted.  And the toothpick to eat them with was pathetic. The nacho chips came with tasteless salsa and guacamole.  In fact while the guacamole was made fresh one of my dinner guests got sliced pieces of avocado instead of guacamole.  

The pizza was truly awful. It arrived cold.  The slices were dry and aside from the arugula the cheese was awful

The only redeeming feature was dessert.  The Black Forest cake was excellent. Sadly only three of the eight people in our group had its. The rest were served a slice of what appeared to be Laura Seacord maple walnut cake. 

All for $46 plus tax and tip.  Of course our server who had just three tables to attend to was MIA. Her follow up on what we thought about the meal came 20 minutes after it was served. Plus everything came to our table within four minutes of each other. So you had all three settings at your table.  A truly awful meal.",2024-02-03T11:21:49Z,48
789,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"Great atmosphere and such a vibe outside on their covered patio area. 

Came here to grab a drink after having drinks at another location, so it was later in the evening already. The place was not that busy and we were seated quickly. I saw that they had an outdoor covered patio with table fire pits and was so aesthetically pleasing. The staff were very accomodating in letting us switch tables to sit outside. Drinks were great and hit the spot for us. Quite delicious!

By the time we were thinking of ending the night, the main room was completely empty. They weren't kidding when they say restaurants and businesses close early in Vancouver.",2023-03-21T19:54:48Z,48
790,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,Very nice location! We had some drinks and enjoyed the music. We sat outside and enjoyed the weather. Our server was nice and her recommendations on drinks were spot on. Love it !!! We will be coming back later tonight. I highly recommend it.,2023-05-13T23:27:09Z,48
791,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"Yesterday, enjoyed a nice, late lunch outside at D6 Bar & Lounge before going on a yacht for four hours. They had a live DJ on-site, playing some old school R&B music, which I absolutely loved! It was such a good vibe.

Between 5 of us, we shared a dozen Kusshi oysters, Dungeness Crab Cake, Jumbo Prawn Cocktail, Whipped Burrata Cheese, California Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Mimosas with orange, blood orange, and passionfruit juices.

Everything was super delicious. My ultimate favourites was the Whipped Burrata Cheese and Dungeness Crab Cake. So good!",2021-08-23T23:56:31Z,48

794,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"Beautiful, hip, upscale rooftop space, located on the 6th floor of the Parq casino, just off the lobby of the Douglas hotel. ( the North west side of the property )

During the day it's open for cocktails and small bites. 
Food is served 1130 am - 9 pm 

I highly recommend the boozy popsicles ! They are served in a glass on ice to prevent melting all over. The last time I had Sangria, but they have had other flavours in the past. 

At night it transforms into a nightclub. It's recommended to make a reservation to reserve a table. And dress code is in effect. 

There are plenty of comfy couches to sit on, and it goes out into the Parq, which has plenty of outdoor seating. 

It's very tastefully decorated, and it also has a large pool table. 

The staff has always been very friendly and attentive without being over bearing. Solid 3.5 stars. I would bump it up to a 4 if they had a blender for frozen cocktail goodness.",2018-08-18T21:39:42Z,48
795,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"Right off the bat...I had a great time.

First off the service is great, from the moment we got to Parq to the check in at D6. We were earlier than we'd like so they let us leave and grab a few bites at Victor. Once we were stamped we were free to come and go.

The bartender was talented and really listened to what we were wanting. She made us a gorgeous and delicious vodka berry cocktail with fresh fruit. I didn't expect that from a bar where you have to line up for drinks. Very nice!

I really like the ambiance.  Low comphy sofas, side tables for drinks and out door seating when you want a quieter place to talk and drink your drinks.

The music was also good. I had a great time here. Very classy with accompanying classy staff! I will definitely be back.  I wish there were more places like this in Vancouver.",2018-05-28T05:57:28Z,48
796,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"Overall, if you're looking for a nice place to dress up, sit and chill for most of the evening, D6 is a great spot to do those activities. However, if you want more of a ""club vibe,"" I highly recommend going somewhere else.

Came here for a friend's birthday and here are some notes about D6:

Dress Code: Everyone here definitely dresses up! Ladies, think heels and dresses. Men, go for dressy shoes, nice shirt, and dark pants. 

Age Range: Definitely the older crowd ---think mid 20s - 30s+

Interior: No ""real"" dance floor. Place is primarily made up of private booths for parties. If you just wander in to chill, you're limited to just a small area that is near the bar, the pool table, and a narrow strip of carpet near the DJ area. A really cool feature about this place was the hidden back room that is located behind a bookshelf. Do note: access to the backroom is really limited so unless you got a table back there, the most you can do is take a quick peek before you get shooed away by the security guards. 

Booths/Table Service: Highly recommend putting in a reservation! Booths were decent, most tables had long couches for seats. As for table service, it was meh. Our server wasn't around for most of the time and when she was, she didn't seem too friendly. Average price for a bottle was in the hundreds, so be prepared to drop those $$$

Music: Meh. Most of the beats were top 40, some EDM, and overall, I wish the DJ played a more consistent style. 

Drinks: Can't speak for the cocktails (didn't get a chance to try any) but I can say that the bartenders here are quick and friendly :) 

Restrooms: Ladies room was pretty clean throughout the night! Yay.",2018-02-13T17:58:32Z,48
797,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"Booked a private event for over 20 people, signed an agreement, had been planning for over a month and then they gave away our spot for a ""production shoot"" Unprofessional, completely disappointed and I had been looking forward to our event in the private lounge behind the bookshelf.",2022-06-10T22:16:54Z,48
798,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"I was really excited to go to D/6 because I'm a teacher and my classroom is D6 lol. Also, it was my first night going out in Vancouver. Long story short: don't go here. 

First, we took a taxi to the hotel where this bar/lounge is located and as we exited the taxi, a couple wanted to get in. The valet guy wouldn't let them in and told them to catch a cab from downstairs instead, lol kind of rude since they were at the door of the taxi anyways.

Second, in order to get up the escalator to the casino area, we had to show IDs, which is fine, but when we left the hotel, I noticed there was no one checking IDs anymore. No consistency....

Third, D/6 stands for the sixth floor of the hotel. I hoped the name would stand for something cooler lol. 

Finally, there were some people we were meeting who were already inside. The scantily clad hostess with an iPad said to come back in an hour because they were full. Lol so the people who were already inside left and we all went somewhere else. Apparently they don't need our business, yet they pay for like 4 bouncers and 2 hostesses who stand around and do nothing about the crowd of people trying to get in. 

The people we were meeting told us that they were told different things about how we we pile be able to get inside and that the hostesses were snobbish in the way they handled the whole situation. It seemed that many groups were turned away even though it was pretty empty inside. All in all, it was a confusing and disappointing experience. I do not recommend coming here.",2017-12-31T04:16:50Z,48
799,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"**Update 10/18/2019**
I've always said, it's the mark of a good establishment to monitor their reviews on Yelp (and elsewhere), to use the critiques of their customers and clients as educational tools to improve and grow, and ideally, to try to make things right to their clients who had a negative experience. D6's management did all that, after my last review. 

I appreciate how they reached out to me and tried to make things right, to have me return to their lounge and make me a loyal customer again. I'm so happy to report that my daughter and I did return (my kid is visiting for only 2 days), and we had a wonderful visit here. It was like it used to be: swanky, posh, with delicious drinks (they have kick-ass bartenders here), and a super live musician who was playing guitar and singing jazzy renditions of older pop songs. It was really cool. 

In past reviews I neglected to mention that they have board games here to borrow, too. My kid taught me how to play Cards against Humanity (she had to explain what some words meant, too. How embarrassing!). 

We met Ryan, who I think was one of the managers here. He is so gracious and friendly. And our server, MJ (Mary Jane) was delightful. 

I am so pleased that this lounge is back on my list of places to go, as it's really a beautiful, classy lounge.",2019-10-18T20:06:24Z,48
800,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"Worst customer service. I emailed, per their request, to make a reservation for my husbands 40th birthday for the rooftop lounge. They replied back and asked for my phone number. After giving my phone number they did not confirm the reservation even after my following up twice. I called and called and called and no answer, I left a message and no return call. I called the other phone number that was listed in the email response I received. Mailbox was full. The phone number called me back and I asked to confirm reservation, in which she responded, ""why are you calling me on this number, this is my personal phone"" - why did you put your phone number in the email if you didn't want to receive a phone call regarding reservations?! She confirmed the reservation after much resistance. My husband gets to d6 on the date and time of reservation -no reservation!?!?!! WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!",2022-04-18T17:30:22Z,48
801,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"STOPPPPP...If you're going to make a reso and have the liberty of choosing a server. ASK FOR J-Ann this girl is absolutely amazing...she dealt with our 20+ group of people with ease. No mistakes with our individual bill and was on point with our orders...and remembered practically all of our names. She kept us in the loop when things were slow in the kitchen.
 This place is such a good vibe because of the people, the music and the over all environment. What made the experience even better was that the service was top notch! I don't even like making review but I met J-Ann and I need to get it out there that this girl is what makes D6 so good. She has the vibe the charisma the smile, and we watched her interact with not just our party but other peoples party as well and you can see the pure joy and smiles this girl can bring. She is by far my most favorite server I have ever encountered. 

D6 has stepped it up with the service and I will definitely be back. 

FOOD WAS SOOO GOODDDDD. flat breads are amazing and so is the wagu burger. 
The cocktails were super tasty. I loved the La Goose and Soda...but the espresso martini that Kristian made was sooo good. He also deserves some recognition for making our drinks amazing.",2022-06-01T02:30:20Z,48
802,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"D/6 Bar and Lounge is a new Indoor/outdoor rooftop venue located in the Parq Hotel and Casino on the 6th floor. This sophisticated and laid back lounge offers a large patio with wonderful views of Vancouver. Offering both comfort and style, D/6 is a delightul choice for casual drinks with friends and even for happy hour. 

HAPPY HOUR runs 2:30-5:30 with drinks only. Prosecco $6, 49 North red and white wine $5, draft beer $5, and cocktails for $10! It would be nice to see some happy food added!

This is not a venue for younger folks, which means you will not find a bunch of rowdy, sloppy, and inebriated 20 somethings hanging off the bar and pool table. How refreshing! I would say there is more of a late 20's-40's crowd at D/6 and the dress code in always in effect. Business casual, so put your fine threads on!

D/6 is tastefully decorated with elegance and style, and dare I say a little sexy? The lighting is soft, maybe even a little romatic, but not as dark as bars like Prohibition. Cozy couches and chairs throughout the lounge, even the bar stools are cushy, and plenty of outdoor seating and space for mingling.

We came to D6 on a Tuesday night at about 8:30 to play pool. It was relativley quiet, which meant we didn't have to wait long to play.  I hear it gets ""line up"" busy on the weekends and it's highly recommended to reserve yourself a table and/or arrive early. Bottle service is also offered for $$$. As I sipped my vino and melted into the ultra comfy, low profile couch, I realised that it didn't matter as much that I was losing at pool, because I was very fond of this lounge.

Phenomenal bar service with talented mixologists, whirling you liquid masterpieces, while entertaining you with their antics. DANIEL gets a shout out for being especially wonderful!!! Not only was Daniel incrediably funny, but he was mad serious about making sure my girlfriend's Bourbon Sour was on point! We had a good chat and laugh with the bartenders and they all seemed as classy as the D/6!! For drinks, I stole a swig from my friends Moscow Mule and just had to have one. It was just stellar!! After ordering the Charcuterie I decided to switch to wine, for obvious reasons. Wine is overpriced, as per usual, with $14 for a 6 ounce glass. The by-the-glass wine list is a rather small selection and I wasn't blown away by the options. Its hard being a wine snob. Bottle wise, there are a lot more options, but again the prices are a little cray. I appologize, I forgot to grab a snap of the wine list and I can't find one online either.

I was pleased with the food menu, with lots of deliscious options and resonable prices considering the upscale ambiance. Menu is share plates, think tapas style. Day menu is served 11:30-9:30. Is there a ""night menu""??  With Daniel's suggestion, we decided on Charcuterie and the Margarita pizza, but I had to add chorizo of course! The Charcuterie was a good size and presented well, but I was disappointed there was no bread and only crackers. I was also sad to see no blue cheese on the board and no real spicy meat. I guess it was a little lackluster for me personally, but still enjoyable. I wonder if the board ingrediants change regularly or if you could request different selections? The Margarita pizza with chorizo was also a satisfactory size and I don't have any compliants to mention (cause we ate it all). I look forward to tasting more food here in the near future.

Overall, this lounge gets 5 stars for ambiance and service, but loses a star as for the food and wine list, as some improvements could be made. I will visit again soon!

Update: my last experience at D/6 was not as good as usual. I was drinking gin martinis, which were tasty and no huge complaints there, but when I tried to explain to the server that I wanted my martini dirty, but ""classy"" dirty not like ""working girl"" dirty, she didn't get my comparison. I ended up with one Olive in my Martini!! On my next drink I asked for extra, which at the end of the night I was charged for. Super not cool. The other mishap was our server didn't let us know the kitchen was closing even though we had menus. In the end they made us a cute little snack dish with almonds and olives, which I assumed was complimentary. Well, it was not.

Also, according to the manager that I spoke to earlier in the night, you can no longer reserve tables after 8pm on a Friday/Saturday without required bottle service. D/6 is becoming a bit snobbish! Unfortunate, nothing good last forever these days!",2019-01-09T18:07:44Z,48
803,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"Torn on how to give the review because of the awful service upon arrival by the host and manager but the total opposite service, good drink and good time once seated by our waitress. Granted that we made a 5pm reservation online and arrived about 20 min late and our reservation got canceled. However on the way, we tried calling them at least 5x to the restaurant and to the hotel to tell them we were running late. However we never reached a human once. We called the phone number on the website for the restaurant and the hotel. See screenshot. Upon arrival, the host said she has to check with the manager because the reservation got canceled even though when we finally did get seated, we only saw 1 other party there and it was empty. Once the manager came over, she was rude, said we could have texted, said she had the phone on her the whole time, and that she can make space but we needed to be out by 7pm. She said all this in the most rude tone like we were not welcome. I was not happy about this service from the beginning but decided to just get 1 drink and then leave since I saw nice reviews about the place on other websites and wanted to check it out. Once seated, the waitress came and asked how we were doing and since I was pretty upset, I told her how I felt about how we were treated until she came along. Especially when we looked around and the place was so empty. I didn't see a reason for such rudeness and I have been to many lovely high scale bars like this before internationally and in NYC. Never was I ever treated like this before. However our waitress apologized for our experience so far in a calm voice and said she hopes she can change our experience and we have a lovely time. Then she proceeded to provide recommendations for a quick drink. She was so awesome!!! The drinks she recommended were delicious and we loved the Douglas fir the most and the la goose and soda was so beautiful along with being refreshing. Perfect contrast on a rainy cold night. Not sure if I will return there after my initial experience but the Douglas fir drink was good enough to make me pause. The next day, we took a chance and went without reservation to the Reflection bar since it was fully booked online. When we arrived, they seated us at the bar without any issue, quickly and courteously for a quick drink although they were mostly all full inside. They just mentioned courteously that they needed the space by a certain time and if that will be OK, which we were. I will definitely recommend Reflection bar over this one due to our experience.",2021-11-30T05:29:56Z,48
804,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"This was our first visit to D/6 bar and it was on a Sunday evening because we wanted to participate in the karaoke from 8 pm - 12.
Karaoke is advertised as 8 pm start but this evening it did not start until 8:35 pm which was a bit annoying since we had limited time available.

We liked the way the bar is furnished and the low lighting (after 8pm) is nice. Finally we have found a bar in Vancouver with relaxed lighting, clean bathrooms and is very spacious with comfortable seating and is not full of TVs showing sports. 

We found our table servers friendly and although the beer selection is limited there was one or two on the list for us. However, with the vast number of craft breweries in B.C. I expected a larger selection here.

I would like the management to know most bars, restaurants and even fast food places in Vancouver now have non-dairy cheese available as a substitute for their pizza and other foods. Since we cannot eat dairy we were surprised non-dairy cheese was not an option on any food here.

But ending on a positive note we enjoyed our visit and will return again with hopes there may be some improvement to the food and drink menu as mentioned above.",2020-03-09T07:54:12Z,48
805,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"Overall - upscale/classy place for a dressed up but laid back type of outing. Get some drinks with your group, lounge on one of the sofas inside or outside and have a good time. Dress code is business casual or above - everyone is dressed up here so don't walk in with casual clothes. The scene is a bit mature and the majority of the people looked to be late 20s and above - mostly 30-40s from what I've seen. Definitely not for younger crowds looking to rage and die of alcohol poisoning. It's right next to the Rogers Stadium and there is a casino in the same building as well. 

Pros - the outdoor area was really well-designed with lots of great lighting and areas to sit and mingle. The crowd was sort of keeping to themselves and didn't bother anyone nearby or cause any scenes. No one looked completely drunk and causing trouble.

Cons - we were able to get in for free through a friend but I imagine the cover would be slightly higher than normal. This is obvious but the drinks are not cheap so plan ahead and pregame if you are looking for a lit night afterwards",2018-08-28T21:10:01Z,48
806,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"I've been trying to book a table for myself and some friends to celebrate the end of our MBA program for almost a week now. I've emailed multiple times, called to only receive voicemail (once transferred to d6) and when I finally got through to someone, she assured me the person in charge of the reservations would reach out to me which obviously has not happened. They must be doing extremely well to not return any emails or phone calls, especially when we were prepared to book a table and spend their required minimum. 

I'm quite disappointed at the level of service provided (which has been nil) and will certainly be bringing our business elsewhere. I should not have to beg a business to take my money!",2019-11-09T01:01:58Z,48
807,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"This place is a great spot more because of the environment than anything, in my opinion. The drinks are okay, but nothing special otherwise. We tried some food too, but with about the same result. 

The location though! It's on the 6th floor of the JW Marriott and has both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor area is covered in spots and has plenty of uncovered open air room too. Great scenic area for drinks.",2018-09-19T21:58:47Z,48

809,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"I've been here few times and usually I'm okay whether it's the wait or getting a table etc but this time around im very not impressed or pleased. D6 really needs to up there game and organize and hire an efficient team or have better skills in training. For a high end lounge it really lacks the service or hosting. The servers definitely lacked the experience. To have referred friends to book the private room im not sure if I would still recommend them to continue pursuing it. Sadly they didn't have enough bottles prepared nor were the girls behind our private bar was even there serving. Our shot glasses were filled as double shots to have people sipping on their shots. 

However Merlin the manager really had it under control when acknowledging my distress but for the price we've paid and willing to provide more it really made a huge effect on our night. Understanding the coordinator in charge was new and first day must have been overwhelmed and first days are usually the hardest but to be hired for a accommodating guest/customers like this must be well aware and well trained such as a promoter would do. 

Overall I would love to book another private event only under certain circumstances and for myself as the party hostess to arrive ahead to have everything under control since d6 team really doesn't have it. To be honest myself could of done a better job at coordinating, hosting and serving. I didn't not want to continue the conversation while intoxicated after the end of night. Merlin did check up on me and asked the overall ending. It ended alright the outlook not so good. 

Plus girls - let's remind that smiles are free, smile even if you hate your job. 

I would really love to do an update on this review but I'm looking to get in contact with Merlin to discuss the experience and what had been lacked. My bf was surely very disappointed. I would love to change my 2 star given the second star is for Merlin so ideally my 2 star to become the 6 start that doesn't exist cause we enjoy being at parq and I would love to be able to say hey I want to go back to d6 or rebook and refer all my friends to book the private lounge.",2018-03-25T19:33:32Z,48
810,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"What an absolutely beautiful spot for a cocktail!!! I came earlier in the night, around 5:45pm with my family and we were blown away. The day was beautiful so the patio outback amongst a pretty nice view, comfy patio seats and greenery really swept us away. 

The cocktail list isn't overly long but they have something that caters to all different kinds of pallets. I absolutely loved my beverage - which I am forgetting the name of but it had lavender in it with a sugared rim and every sip was heavenly and not overly spirit forward which is exactly to my liking. 

Our waitress was tentative and very sweet. She came to us as soon as we got comfy, waters were never empty and other waitresses checked in to make sure we had been already taken care of. It makes you feel high class and important, we loved it! 

I will absolutely come here again (PS there's a hidden room in the back behind the pool table that can be booked out!!!)",2018-05-25T16:00:41Z,48

Ive been to D6 many times and normaly it is an awesome experience and the one time I was hoping for the best experience, I received the worst.. I had called and booked a reservation for 5 people and told them it was my birthday (they even called the day before to confirm). My friends and I get there, they dont have my name in my system.. but its fine, we get in. Once we're in, we ask if a cheese platter can be delivered from the Victor, the waitress says yes. We order a bottle of champagne, the waitress says coming right away. We also order cocktails. About 20mins pass, the waitress comes back and informs us they cant do the cheese platter and they have no more of that specific champagne.. also two of my friends never received their cocktails.. and to end the experience, another waitress drops a glass and sprays glass all over our feet and some even got on the table. Very dissapointed in how things happened...",2021-06-28T16:38:09Z,48

We just had drinks and some appetizers. But I find the seating was not the most comfortable. I wish they had more proper sit-down dining tables instead of casual seats. 

One curious observation: I saw some company was hosting an event for around 100 people at the back (heard it from the waitress). I was surprised to see that because the space at the back wasn't that big, and fitting 100 people seemed strange to me.",2019-05-11T06:24:42Z,48
819,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,A friend of mine was staying at the hotel as they came all the way down from Victoria for a show and we decided to have a few drinks before walking to the stadium. I don't drink so had some virgin drinks that the bartender had his imagination with but my buddy had some drinks before the show. We just wanted somewhere to catch up and catch up before getting surrounded by noise of the concert. The ambiance is really nice and the staff is super friendly.,2018-06-01T22:49:40Z,48
820,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"Very disappointing first visit. My girlfriend and I were staying at the Parq Hotel and it was early Fri evening and we asked the concierge for a recommendation of a cocktail bar nearby. He recommended D/6 and so we took the elevator up to the 6th Floor.
You enter through the Douglas Hotel which has a beautiful lobby area. We were enthusiastically greeted by a couple of lovely ladies who showed us to the patio area and we were given our choice of table.
The D/6 indoor/outdoor patio is quite spectacular and so we settled down for a few drinks to enjoy the warm weather.
The patio was not busy, maybe 6 tables occupied? We sat for a while, with no menus and no water and were quite effectively ignored by several servers (one of whom actually had to maneuver around our table 3 times to get to her customers). After 10-12 mins we just decided to flag down a server and we quickly ordered a couple of cocktails to get things rolling.
The drinks came but we immediately noticed an ice cube at the top of my girlfriend's cocktail contained some black debris inside and so we looked around for our server for assistance. More minutes passed and so I just took the drink over to the Bar. After drawing the attention of one of the 3 bartenders on service, I pointed out the offending ice cube and watched while he went through an overly dramatic scrutiny of the drink, he then offered to make another one and have it sent over.
After a new drink was served up we finished our cocktails but felt somewhat deflated with the experience and so settled our bill and left.
Overall, we were disappointed. The initial greeting was perfect but that's as good as it got. We were prepared to sit and relax and spend some money but the inattentive service and uninviting vibe made us go elsewhere - perhaps we're not the target audience...",2018-06-07T00:37:31Z,48

We were greeted by the GM Marlon English who took us into the beautiful in door/ outdoor lounge and accommodated us in our own private couch area. He also checked in on us later in the night to make sure we were happy with everything. The servers were great, the drinks were perfectly strong and the music was exactly what all of us 8 ladies on a night out would want.

823,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,D6 is fairly new but I've been here quite a few times on the weekend. I love the atmosphere and decor. It's a very relaxing lounge and a very nice change from the club scene. It's gotten a lot busier since they've opened so it's probably wiser to go before midnight to avoid line ups. They're also open on weekdays and it's a lot quieter but a good place to grab drinks and have a chill night.,2018-04-30T07:21:20Z,48

The venue is modern and stylish. The staff was upscale and professional. 

One bartender however certainly stands out from the rest ... Daniel.

Daniel has a personality that is friendly and inviting and his memory is fantastic.

I visited the lounge a few times during my stay to have a drink on down time or check out the nightlife and as the patrons walked up he would know their order just the way they liked it. 

He really adds life to the place and makes it shine.

My stay in Vancouver was a memorable one because of great people like Daniel!

828,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"I went to D6 for the first time, I was excited since I had a friend tell me it was a good spot to check out but I was sadly mistaken. I went there and upon arrival the staff was very rude!... The staff continuously said the bar was full once me and my friends got there at 1030pm but kept letting people in continuously except us and our party had a table. There was a black girl working the front with almost bald hair/a very short cut who was arrogant and rude with zero hospitality skills and a guy named Marlon that kept telling her not to let us in becuase apparently they were full but Marlon let two girls that came in and expressed that they weren't on guestlist (even though our party had a table) and he still let them in before us. I felt discriminated against. And that they would only let in a certain race... The only moment where I felt happy was when one of their employees Charles a bouncer in the front was very accepting and nice to us, On our way in and on our way out he treated us very nice and made us feel welcomed. That is truly the only time I felt like D6 was good. Is when Charles made us feel welcomed. So thank you to Charles, you were the highlight of the night and to me the best employee at D6! However the rest of the employees at the front of the entrance need to learn some manners and be more accepting of their own kind of and other races entering their facility.",2018-12-02T13:02:03Z,48
829,D/6 Bar & Lounge,3.6,"I've read so many negative comments about this place, but I still went in to check it out.  I made reservations for 2 at 11pm on a Saturday and was told that we can have a table but they have to close our table at 12 midnight.  We were ok with that.  When we arrived at 1102, we were told that we can have a table but they have to close it by 1130.  We were also told that they don't know who took my reservation but they just don't make reservations for 11pm, and that my name isn't even on the list.  We ended up not getting a table and we were told to just stand around the area.  My husband and I were very disappointed to have been misinformed and they didn't do anything to make up for it.  I would expect an upscale place would take care of their clients.  The place is just very disorganized.

838,The Pint Public House,2.9,"We were in the neighborhood and the fiancé remembered The Pint as being a key place to watch the UFC. Unsurprisingly, the place was packed and we were directed towards the basement of the pub in our search for an unoccupied table.

The atmosphere struck me as a no-frills pub. Low ceilings, dark tables that have handled many spills, and generally a place where the patrons care the most about the value of their beer, and having a good line of sight to one of the multiple TV's posted around the room. We had our respective drinks and shared a giant plate of nachos. The place got quite a bit hot and stuffy (given the sheer amount of people) but the place did their best with the loud industrialized fans. We left as the UFC program was coming to a close.

One of the worst pours I have ever had, every drink in the small cups which gets spilled out with the tight crowds of people pushing you on your way back to the table which was ""chilled"" mixed with water as their preferential delivery method. That's a good way to make lots of money on little alcohol and to keep the orders coming.

The downstairs area became very hot quick like they turn off the AC when they convert from restaurant to night club. The table we sat at had a strobing light in which they made a light effort to fix and then said..meh, whatevers.

The upstairs area turned very full and young. A bit rude here when it gets late which was a reality check since everyone was so darn Canadian friendly during the dinner hour.

-They have towers of draft (something I haven't found in Vancouver since Fogg 'n Suds stopped selling them).

-They have 40 different varieties of wings (We managed to try 12 of them during our visit. My recommendation? Stick to the BBQ variants. The rest were undersauced and bland).

-They have 30 CENT WINGS ON WEDNESDAYS. That's $4 for a pound. We went through 12 pounds and 2 towers of beer and our bill worked out to less than $20 per person. The daily happy hour special is pretty ridiculous as well.

-They literally have a billion TVs. I don't think there was a blind spot in the entire (gigantic) space.

Friendly staff, cheap wings, copious amounts of beer, and it isn't Honey. I'm never leaving this place (seriously, I'm posting this from a crawlspace in the bathroom that I've claimed as my own).",2012-04-03T20:07:19Z,273
856,The Pint Public House,2.9,"I was here on Sept 28th Saturday for early dinner/Happy Hour dinner with my sister to use our gift card. Two of us ordered the following: Hoegaarden ($8.50), wedge fries ($5) and Pulled Pork sliders ($5) with free wings. 

Pulled pork sliders were tasty and delicious. Fries were soggy and precooked we didn't like it at all. We had Mango Chipotle wings for the purchase of the drink; it was so gross. Wings came out fresh; however, it was pretty salty and had no taste of mango. Why would it be Mango Chipotle without any mangos in them? No clue. 

Hoegaarden was not bad, but wings left us feeling very thirsty after finishing our meals. Few hours later, I ended up drinking lots of water to wash down the sodium. Happy Hour was a great deal, but I didn't find the food to be memorable at all.",2019-10-20T20:31:37Z,273
857,The Pint Public House,2.9,"It's been a minute since I have been to Vancouver. About 2 1/2 years. This might have been the last restaurant i went to, the last time I was in town. Google said it was 3 years ago. But I think I did enjoy my last visit, so I walked over a mile for another visit. They were having a special on wings, half off. So I got an order of wings, with maple bbq sauce. They do charge extra for the celery/carrots (didnt not ask if I wanted them or that there was a charge) and extra for the dipping sauce. Their wings are very very small. BUT, I dont see that as a problem. There is a lot of meat on them and easier to fit in your mouth. The sauce was a good. Had a small kick to it. I also got an order of hummus and veggies. The bartender initially forgot to put the order in. But, no big deal. It did take a while for the wings to come out. And, when they did, they were just on the warm side. So, they might have been sitting out for a little bit. But, again, they were still good. The hummus was ok. It seemed like it was lacking flavor. They didnt skimp on the veggies, though. It's a pretty good joint. Would visit again with no hesitation.",2022-03-06T03:11:22Z,273
858,The Pint Public House,2.9,"A few months ago, I had my first escape room experience (we were successful)! But prior to that, we enjoyed some appies and drinks (perhaps the drinks helped ) at the Pint, as it was close by.

We ordered wings, poutine, and nachos. They had some deal going on at that time of if you bought certain beers, you'd get some free wings.. so a few of us took advantage of that.

The atmosphere is the same as any other pub-type place. Lots of TVs around to watch sports, high stool chairs and tables, and loud and lively all around. Fun times!",2020-02-08T22:10:26Z,273
859,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Well. Here ya go. Wish I could say more. Our server said ""well these are probably the healthiest wings because they aren't injected with steroids.""",2022-01-06T06:34:26Z,273

Caribbean Jerk-2/5 not bad.  Nice kick but was expecting better
Insanity-1/5  Too spicy!  Honey Garlic-3/5 decent.  Ah what the hell, there are too many wing flavours for me to review!!!!   I think they have over 40 flavours here off the top of my head and it used to be that you would get a free basket of wings here during happy hour on Wednesday if you ordered a pint of beer.   They used to do a free basket of perogies here Thursdays with a pint of beer as well.  I've had many fun nights here on the weekends and I would recommend you get here early before the line ups and cover start.  But with such a huge space including the basement this bar still gets really full on the weekends.   It's a great place to watch sports and TeeJay is an awesome bartender if you ever get the pleasure of having him serve you.",2019-02-24T08:05:32Z,273
861,The Pint Public House,2.9,"I had preconceived notions about this place. I thought it was a place that people from the burbs went to, when they came downtown for a show at Rogers arena. Well, that happens to be true, it's packed with fans anytime there's an event at Rogers arena, but what I had overlooked is the amazing daily deals that they have. 

First of all, you get a free pound of wings when you order a pint of beer during happy hour. There are 40 flavors to choose from. That alone will make you come back a few times. On top of that they've got some fantastic daily deals as well.

We came here before a game at Rogers arena, when it was packed. The deals made us come back the very next day for the steak bites. We haven't tried rib day, but we believe that the wings are the winners. They all come with the same 40 flavors. We had some mini Yorkshire puddings that were good too. I have a feeling the other staples on their menu are also good. So they deserve the popularity that they enjoy.

Finally, what really makes it 5 star is the server we had. We happened to have the same server two days in a row and she was fantastic. Handled the crowded bar with no problem at all. Props!",2018-04-04T09:51:12Z,273
862,The Pint Public House,2.9,"BF & I did extensive research for the best atmosphere to watch the Seahawks game while we were in Vancouver last weekend. He saw that a Seahawks fan group was going to be at the Pint, so we arrived about an hour prior to SNF kickoff to a packed house. We took a couple laps around the bar before we were able to find a vacated table, so it definitely seems like a popular spot for games.

It turned out to be exactly the vibe we were looking for--loud fans, TVs everywhere, and we just happened to find a corner table with a TV on either side of us. I ordered a white wine sangria that was perfect for me, and he had a few giant (and truly, I mean giant) pints of beer. Half way through the game, we shared an order of the spicy honey ginger wings. I wasn't expecting much flavor wise, but the sauce turned out to be super yummy! I do have to note that the wings were laughably tiny, but that could just be me being used to the hormone-injected chicken creatures in the US. Not really worth $13 for such a tiny amount of meat, but due to the favorable USD to CAD conversion, we didn't really mind.

Our waitress was super sweet and did a great job checking in on everyone, despite having a ton of busy tables--she even refilled my water! I'd say 4 stars for ambiance & service, and 3.5 for food. All in all, we had a great time here (despite the Seahawks close loss) and would definitely recommend it to anyone in search of a true sports bar environment in Vancouver.",2020-01-03T22:30:27Z,273
863,The Pint Public House,2.9,"It was ok for an afternoon drink at the bar.
Service was a 3.
Drink selections, a 3.
The business itself is newer but the building looks ancient. Kind of cool architecture. 
It was right on the edge of China Town so expect many bums, sirens and people 'on the edge' coming into the bar calling themselves Trump and asking for water and a draught beer with their last pennies.
Entertaining but only enough so for one drink. 
People at nearby tables were getting the usual pub fare food but it was not speaking to me, to actually eat here.",2017-08-30T20:33:42Z,273
864,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Went to the pint for trivia night, and ordered vodka sodas off my server for the night

Upon receiving my bill I noticed she charged me for premium vodka? So when I asked why when I just simply ordered a vodka soda and no exchange of ""well vodka or premium"" was made, she said ""they're out of house vodka""
When I told her she never said that at the time of me ordering she stated ""she was really busy and would just take 10$ off my bill"" 
Now normally I would just shrug it off as I'm in the industry and I understand being busy but

She flat out lied.
After going up and asking the bartender if they had house vodka and being told yes, that's SUPER shady and I'll never be back and I'll be warning anyone I know to check their bills any time they go there

Two stars because the wings were delicious and I'll be sad to never have them again",2019-10-11T18:52:35Z,273
865,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Yesterday, my husband and I went to The Pint for their Wing Wednesday special (40 cent wings, $4 minimum).  We had the creamy dill, red hot, and parmesan herb wings.  The creamy dill was good, the red hot were OK (nothing special), and the parmesan wings were meh.  Based on just the wings, I'd probably give The Pint 3 stars, because for $4, you really can't beat that price, and the wings were decent.  And while they weren't the best wings ever, they have 40 flavours to choose from, and hey, FOUR BUCKS.  (In fact, one set of wings was free, as we were there during happy hour, in which an order of wings is free with a purchase of a pint.)

The reason why I am only giving this place two stars is because their wine prices are ABSURD.  Yeah, I know this is a beer place (it *is* called The Pint, after all), but come on, give wine drinkers/non-beer drinkers a break!  I wasn't expecting a fantastic deal, but their wine prices were something ridiculous like $7.95 and $10.95 (if I remember correctly -- I can't find a drinks menu online) for 5 and 8 ounce glasses; not even 6 and 9 ounces!  Fuck that shit.  And, to top it off, there weren't even cheap brands listed, simply red or white.  I don't expect a place like The Pint to offer good quality wines, but if you're going to charge that much for FIVE AND EIGHT OUNCES, you gotta do better than ""red"" and ""white"".  And no happy hour specials on wine, either.  (I ended up getting a gin and tonic, which was OK.)

Another reason for the two stars is, my husband went to use the bathroom and ran out with a look of horror on his face, as there was a lot of STUFF -- organic STUFF, you know what I'm saying?  (It was probably a good thing in this case that bathrooms were segregated between what kind of genitalia is between your legs, because I don't want to see STUFF.)

In summary, The Pint is a decent place if you want some cheap, OK wings, and if you're a beer drinker.  But it's not a place to go if you drink wine, or if you need to use the bathroom.

866,The Pint Public House,2.9,"This is a good place for wings on Wed. Super cheap! Bill was a little less than  20 and we ordered 3 lbs of wings and 2 pops. Place is super casual and it is a fun sports bar. 

The food came out 15 mins after we ordered. We had the honey sriacha, maple dry rub, and pineapple curry. The maple dry rub was my favourite because it was crispy while having a perfect mix of sweet and savoury.

We sat down at the bar. The bartender was nice but a bit forgetful when it came to our bill. Took a while to get our bill. Other than that factor, it was good food and I would definitely come back for wings.",2018-04-05T05:36:47Z,273
867,The Pint Public House,2.9,"I'm so glad I didn't let the poor reviews deter me from drinking here before the Sharks/Canucks game. It's super close to Rogers Arena and I definitely didn't want to be late for the game so staying close by was important. We decided to just check it out have a few shots and a beer here. 

Cody was our bartender and he was awesome! Super friendly, talkative and most importantly genuine! None of that false BS you get at some bars and restaurants. 

$5 shots of jack (we took 3 each) 

And I had my first Caesar here! I had never even heard of these bloody-mary type drinks but apparently Vancouverites love em and now so do I. We liked them so much we took our bartenders recommendation on where to go get really good ones (Score on Davie) and had brunch there.

I went for a local IPA ($8, I guess they inflated the beer prices to make up for the special) and wings with barbecue sauce and blue cheese. The wings were good, and the service was friendly and efficient.",2019-03-13T04:14:23Z,273
869,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Came for wing wed. It wasn't overly busy.

Our server was Ariel who was great. Friendly, cute and efficient. But that's where the positivity ends.

My husband ordered a pint of beer ( which came with a free pound of wings ) he chose Kentucky Bourbon. 

I ordered citrus lime dry rub. To drink I asked for a strawberry Mojito ( it was not on menu, but she said she could get them to add and muddle the strawberries ) 

I had second thoughts, but didn't change my order ( but should have )
We also decided on an order of herb parmesan wings.  

So the food comes. All the chicken wings pretty much sucked. Despite the fact we had ordered All dry rub - they were all fatty and greasy. Not baked - deep fried.

The food runner who dropped them off was bitter . They were priced way too high and the quality was way too low.

No carrots and celery which may of been the only good thing to eat. Then to top it off 
My drink was awful. Tasteless and bitter. No fruity flavour at all. I had to get a side of pineapple in order to choke it down.

Lastly, on the bill we got charged for the wings that were supposed to be free. 
Lucky for us Ariel took care of that and we were on our way. Dissatisfied and still hungry.

It was packed inside, so we decided to sit at the bar. We were attended to right away, and we ordered some redbull vodkas. The drinks were alright, but the highlight of this place was our friendly bartender. 
She chatted with us quite a bit. She gave us pointers on where to go as far as good clubs, and good places to eat. She also told us which other Canadian cities to go to as far as nightlife. So now my buddy and I have Montreal in our sights.
The bar has an interesting decor, and has plenty of flat panel TVs to catch hockey games.

875,The Pint Public House,2.9,"I was very underwhelmed by my experience at The Pint this past weekend.

Came here the other day before the Whitecaps game with a friend who visits regularly.
He arrived awhile before me, and by the time I got there my friend was finished his meal and was polishing off a drink.  The place was packed.

Our waitress came by quickly to enquire about drinks but then forgot to bring over a menu for me.  About fifteen minutes later she came back to take my order.   Luckily I had already perused their menu on my phone.  With my order placed, I decided to visit the bar to get myself some water, since I hadn't been provided any.

I ordered the inferno burger($15) with sweet potato fries as my side(+$2).   The inferno burger features onion rings, jalapenos and Havarti.  With one bite, the buns fell apart, and I ate the rest of the burger and toppings with knife and fork.  Not exactly the best way to have a burger if you ask me!  It was decent enough, but for the price paid for the meal, I expected much better quality, and more fries would have been appreciated.

As for the atmosphere here, well, it's a pub.  It was really noisy and there wasn't a seat to be had.  For the size of the space they do accommodate a large number of guests, so I suppose it's no wonder that it gets loud.   I don't visit this area often, and when I do it's usually for a movie across the street.

On account of the subpar service and food, I won't be returning.",2017-07-25T22:56:44Z,273
876,The Pint Public House,2.9,"I love me a pound of some good, cheap wings. And that is what The Pint is good at. On Wing Wednesday's their happy hour deal (3PM-6PM) is get a beer and you get a free pound of wings.... SORRY WHAT?! One of the best deals in town for sure. Outside the hours of 3-6, their regular wing special is $4 for a pound of wings if you get a drink, so I'd still say that's a pretty damn good deal. Not to mention they have 40 different flavours, which all look tasty. 

I've never gotten anything besides the wings here, to be honest. But from what I've seen at other tables, it all looks pretty good. The menu basically consists of your typical pub food - burgers, nachos, etc. 

Their service isn't always the best, but whatever. You're coming here for a drink and wings, not to be pampered. The place is big, so there are always tables available. Except on game days. Just show up earlier, because the tables tend to go quick! 

I've come here quite a few times on weekends and it's a ton of fun. If you have a big group, I'd recommend either making a reservation ahead of time OR getting someone from your party to go in early to snag a table. Because, once 9 PM hits, there is going to be a line out that door.

how can you go wrong with $4 for a lb of wings with over 40 flavour possibilities and a wide selection of beers....from a glass to table kegs. 

with the whitecaps games about to happen the place was packed before 7. we were lucky to get a seating for 6. 

servers were swamped clearing tables and taking orders, as well as serving. ours did a good job and was very patient despite the stress that she was in. 

beer came cold and wings pipping hot. even orders for water and more napkins were attended to quick. sure people were waiting too around us but no one was grumpy. everyone was in a happy mood and the ambiance was perfect for a weds wings night. 

food was fresh and flavours were amazing! special mention to the salt and pepper one ...which i think is the all-time fav here as all tables were ordering more of it. 

for the weds wings wings night...i give 5 stars. service another 5 stars. when we asked for the bill, server even took time to do separate billing as well as group one for some things we ordered. other places would have not been that detailed and patient.

Happy hour runs from Mon-Fri 4-6pm and one can receive 1 lb of wings (reg $13) with the purchase of one pint of beer (domestic $9/pint).

We arrived at around 4pm on a Friday night and ground floor is jammed packed. What I don't realize is that they allow ppl to make reservations for a pub. We saw at least 8 tables with reservation flags. We were given the advice to walk down to the basement for more seating. We were able to find a 6-person seat (it is pretty packed by 5pm) towards the end of the room.  

We ordered at drinks and wings at 4:35pm and the wings arrived at 5:04pm. We wanted to reorder but the server NEVER came back and when we waved at her over 3 times over the course of 15 mins she didn't  even look up to look at us. When we finally had her attention, she was pissed off and gave us total attitude and told  us ""so and so"" is our server, not her. But she was the server that came by and took our first order!!!! We even had trouble getting someone's attention to pay for our bill.

The wings are pretty generous and the pints are ok decent.

(I got a whiskey sour cocktail), but I love how convenient it is to get to from Stadium sky train, and the food came EXTREMELY fast after we ordered, and who likes to wait for their food?  No one!  Especially not me!  I was very pleased with how speedy the service was, and my pulled pork tacos were supposed to be appetizer sized but I had it all to myself and it was enough to be a substantial entree.  I found my tacos to be very flavourful and filling.  I checked out their website and it says they have cheap specials everyday (except for sat) and they also have happy hour from 3-6 mon-fri.  A pound of wings and a pint of beer for 6.75?  what a deal!!  I wanna be back to try the wings cuz I hear great things about them.

The only thing that put me off about this place was that the server asked us ""Do you have anywhere to go?  I'll get your bill ready.""..... The way she said it seemed as if she was trying to rush us out of the place, which is rather annoying when you want to just chill and chat with your friends.  We still took our time after the bill came though because we were clearly not ready to leave yet!  I think I'll come back because there are tons of places to sit and the food comes really fast.

884,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Wing night at The Pint!
My friend organized a wing night for Canucks versus Colorado at The Pint. Otherwise I'd never have gone to the pub -- just not my scene.
The reservation was downstairs, but since there was no hostess table, it was a bit tricky figuring it out. I ended up going downstairs where it wasn't super-packed pre-show and asking a bartender at a not-very-full bar. Fortunately my question was answered very quickly -- bonus points for staff efficiency!

TIP: Reserve a table downstairs for pre-game dinner. Once most people leave for the game, the area will be much, much quieter because they will likely close that section. You won't get kicked out, but they won't be letting anyone go downstairs either, unless the pub becomes super-busy.
TIP: Auto-gratuity for groups of 10+, but you can also get a 20% food discount for being a large group. Ask your server.
TIP: If you're going to have a beer anyway, ask about the offer of a free pound of wings with order of a pint of beer.

Quite a few gluten-free items (items with a checkmark on the menu).

40-Way Wings ($11 per pound, or 40 cents per wing on Wing Wednesday)
-There really are a lot of flavours. Spiciness is generally weak even for ""hot"" items.
-I went with orange-ginger as that seemed to be the most interesting flavour. Both orange and ginger flavours were sadly weak, but the orange made this easier to eat compared to most savoury-flavoured wings.
-They don't come exactly piping hot and get cold pretty easily.
-Size is OK I guess. Generally nicely fried and you can just suck the meat cleanly off the bone..
-1 pound has approximately 10-11 wings, which makes then about a buck per wing at regular price.

Pint Fries ($7)
-OK but not very crispy outside.
-Seasoning not very uniformly applied -- some were salty, some seemed to have nothing.
-Quantity also looks weak for $7. For $1 more you could have a meaty poutine elsewhere.

Non-alcoholic beer ($5.65)
-Horrible bitter drink. If you like coffee with no milk and no sugar, I guess it could grow on you.
-Tastes like bitter barley or bad popcorn. ???
-I tried this thinking it might be an interesting or sweet non-alcoholic beer, but I guess it's just a tastes-like-beer drink but has no alcohol. Anyway, yuck. Non drinkers stay away. Beer drinkers be cautious.

Lots of TVs, but loud music playing instead of what's on TV.

During the pre-game full-house, even an order of wings can take a long time and it can be hard to even spot any server to get anything basic like water.",2016-03-17T06:24:21Z,273
885,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Went here on Friday for a double date with my fellow Yelp friends! We came for Happy Hour - Beer and Wings special (Buy any pint beer and get 1lbs of wings for free, which is a great special!) and The Raptors game. The upstairs was busy, so we picked a booth downstairs. 

We all ordered a beer and wings at around 530pm, Happy Hour ends at 6pm. My friend's fiancé tried to get our servers attention to order again before 6, but she didn't come to our table. We managed to track her down at 545pm to place another order and she said she would come by, but didn't. I approached the server at the till to place the same order (just to keep it simple for the server) and she said Happy Hour was over and brushed me off even though I was standing there waiting for her for a few minutes before 6.  

Our server came to our table shortly after and my friends fiancé asked to speak to the manager. Our server went to speak to her manager and came back shortly to said we were good to go on the Happy Hour.  

After this experience, our server was not as cheery (as she was at first - joking and laughing with us) and would not really acknowledge us, she only spoke and made eye contact with my friend's fiancé. Even thou we were all being nice and trying to talk to her after because mistakes happen and it's about how to deal with the situation and move forward.

The wings were big and juicy! One pound of wings is about 10 wings with many delicious flavours to pick from. The guy hosting The Raptors was super friendly and did a great job organizing the event. There are tons of TVs to catch the game. Too bad the Raptors lost and are eliminate from the playoffs:( but hey, we always have fun on double dates with Alex and Andrew:) 

This is my first time at The Pint and it was a lot of fun! I would back...but I would say just to avoid the bad service experience, maybe let all your tables know when the last call for Happy Hour is to avoid any missed orders and unhappy customers.",2016-05-30T00:06:33Z,273

887,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Ended up coming here with a group of friends for the soccer game. It was a little busy when we arrived so we were sat at two different tables, luckily they were next to each other though which was accommodating. 

Because it was a game we didn't come in looking for a whole meal, just ordered a pitcher of Bud which was reasonably priced and the Pint sized nachos with pulled pork. That was by far the largest mountain of nachos I've ever seen in my life and between two guys we could barely finish it. Overall it was amazing though, little overpriced but for a one and done you can't go wrong.

I found because the place was busy it was difficult tracking down our waitress to refill drinks or make an order. That was really my only complaint, will probably come back on a Tuesday to try their team platters on discount.",2016-07-02T00:32:14Z,273
888,The Pint Public House,2.9,"I always would come here when there is a Whitecaps FC viewing party or when my friends would come abduct me to watch a Seattle Seahawks game or to add more pain, an Arsenal FC game. The pint has been one of the places to meet up with friends, to catch a game or to spend time with family even though it is a pub place, it has been one of the most surprising experiences ever. 

The pub offers wings with 40 types of flavours, rubs and sauces, ribs, burgers, sandwiches and meals, they also offered the Heart Smart meal. It is basically 2 chicken breasts rubbed with oil and herbs and then grilled to perfection. The sides come with basmati rice, carrots, celery, broccoli and tomatoes, I decided to order this meal because I did not feel like having any oily food which would ruin my body in some way or form. It costed $14 for a meal like this

Here I am with the meal. I see 2 chicken breasts, with half of the plate being long grain basmati rice and half of the plate being raw vegetables. The chicken was very tender and tasting it reminded me of having lemongrass chicken with the char marks and the flavour of the herbs. The veggies I believe came from like those boxed platters where you give out at a party tray. The raw veggies were accompanied by a ranch dip but I decided to pass on it because the ranch was probably fattening for me and it would ruin my fitness goals.

Service was done pretty well for a Whitecaps Viewing Party. I was pleased with the fact that we got exceptional customer service while the place was packed with Canucks fans and Whitecaps fans. This is the best real deal place if you want good pub food, lots of events and great times.",2016-03-16T19:57:30Z,273
889,The Pint Public House,2.9,"After a long shift downtown a friend and I decided to go to a pub at 11:30pm. Your probably thinking girl, it's downtown and a Tuesday night what were you thinking. I know, I thought the same, but with some luck we found this sweet place that was open until 2am!! ATTENTION, ATTENTION, IF YOU LOVE CHICKEN WINGS THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU. 

The first thing we noticed was the vibe I was totally digging it old school Easy E was playing at 11:30pm, umm yessss! The place was covered with murals of albums, picture frames and sayings. Loved it! 

We looked over at the sign and saw that happy hour you get a free pound of wings with a pint. SCORE!! Even though it wasn't happy hour wings are $4 with a drink after that. I mean that's a good deal compared to other places and it gets even better. Little did we know we were at the house of the 40 chicken wing flavours. I was in heaven because my favourite thing in the whole wide world are CHICKEN WINGS and 40 flavours to choose from, oh man I hit the jackpot. When I saw the words abound I freaked out and asked the waitress ""How big is a pound? How many come in a pound? Is it enough for me? She confirmed it was about 8-12 wings and she was right. Let me tell you guys I don't know why I was even scared it filled me up I didnt even want to steal some fries off my friend and I always do. I normally only get honey garlic, but decided to switch it up. Teriyaki it was , I was taking a risk here going out if my comfort zone because teriyaki isn't something I like. The sauce was normally super bitter & strong. Oh man was I in for a surprise I was not disappointed. If anything I'm a new lover of teriyaki wings.. but probably just from here hahah! I also got nestea because we all know I love it, but make sure to ask for lots of ice because it's a little to sweet and when the ice melts it's just right well what drinks isn't am I right? 

As for other food, my friend got the fish & fries. Going to be honest when I normally get fish and fries anywhere the fries are soggy and the fish is two small fillets. But not here, the fries (which is A LOT) are just right and the two pieces of fishes are big! It comes with this special tartar sauce that I wanted to go into the kitchen and ask where they got it or how it was made because I was I love. Forget normal tartar sauce this ones better! Also we cannot forget that it comes with coleslaw, COLESLAW I know. It was quite a bit more than I normally get anywhere. Needless to say I had to help my friend finish because he couldn't finish it, it was too much for him. Says a lot ehh. 

Ps: The bartender gave me a shot for being a good sport, you know me. It was whiskey, I'm not a whiskey lover or drinker but I sure am now. Thank you for suggesting it because now I might just love whiskey ;P

After a long night at the Pint: Home of the 40 favours I will defiantly be back to try some more wings and I will be back with more friends. I totally recommend this place to watch a game, dance around, defiantly happy hour, of course late night (more like midnight) late shift din din sesh and especially to come after when it's 10-12 and you're been kicked out of the pub you were at ;) come on over! 

Wings, I will be back for you!",2017-10-04T23:38:11Z,273
890,The Pint Public House,2.9,"This place is nuts on a weekend evening. It's packed with all kinds of people. You've got every type of group: those that want to keep to themselves, those that want to party, those that have partied way too hard already and are clearly drunk out of their minds and possibly high. I watched as two male friends got into an altercation near the bar. Their yelling led to one of the friends chocking the other, just to let go and calm down. A few minutes later they were hugging each other and laughing. But, it's a popping bar late at night. What do you expect? Security is roaming and does a great job at keeping party goers safe. I never once felt uncomfortable and was happily able to enjoy my own business.

That business of course was wings and beer. 

We opted for the platter which was a great deal: $29 for wings, boneless wings and sliders, all covered in nachos and fries. It also comes with a dip of your choice and some carrots and celery sticks. We opted for two pounds of regular wings, instead of the boneless wings, and they were happy to substitute. We also got a pitcher of Kokanee for just over $15. Not a bad deal at all.

Our server was great and checked up on us regularly. The wings were pretty decent and we really enjoyed all the options in the platter. We'll definitely be back the next time we want to fill up on junk without breaking the bank.",2016-01-09T22:18:31Z,273
891,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Avoid if there is any event going on downtown. Incredibly understaffed. Often sat with empty drinks. Ordered food as a group. 2 dishes came out after 20 minutes, an order of wings came out after 40 minutes, a second order of wings came out after almost an hour, and my food never made it to me. Server was very apologetic and discounted food or drinks off 4 out of 6 people's bills but my 2 drinks were still on the bill even though it was my food that never came out. But at least they checked our vaccine passports this time. Will definitely be finding a new place to have predrink before shows or events as will the others in our group.",2021-10-30T18:04:38Z,273
892,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Service was good but a bit slow, understandable since place was under renovations and busy as a church on a sunday easter weekend.

893,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Tried their wings after noticing that they have 40 flavours.  This is actually kind of cheating though, as they're really just the same same wings, with different flavours dumped on top.

Orange ginger - a bit too sweet for my liking, but the ginger had a nice kick.
Thai chili - as Thai as a cheeseburger, but let's face it, you can't go wrong with anything sweet and spicy.",2013-12-20T01:21:27Z,273
894,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Our food order got messed up, we ordered wings and ribs, they brought double wings instead of ribs, not a big deal, we were hungry and ate more wings. Paid our bill and moved to the bar for some drinks. When we asked for the check, the bartender had charged us drinks we didn't have. I calmly asked him if this was correct and is he sure. He yelled at me ""you have 2 choices, you can pay the bill or I call the police for refusing to pay the bill"". I was just asking and trying to clarify the bill and never said I wouldn't pay. Everyone stopped and stared at the scene of this guy yelling at us 2 women, it was completely embarrassing. Since the bartender was yelling at me, I asked to see the manager. The bartender stormed off and had an animated conversation with the manager who came over and asked me what the problem was. I explained, he listened and apologized. He said it was a busy night and the bartender was probably tired (it was around 10pm). 
A message to the bartender: I've worked in the service industry, it can get busy. There's no excuse for your behavior. Take a break if you need to. Get a job in a cotton ball factory if you can't take the stress. You're not an air traffic controller, you sling drinks, get over yourself.",2019-03-11T20:33:18Z,273

Returned here in 2017 before a hockey game again and it was pretty busy. We were able to find a table rather quickly and ordered right away since game time was only 60 min away. 60 min later we were still waiting for our food. We had no choice but to cancel our food order. The waitress kept saying the kitchen was slammed. The people next to us had been waiting over an hour for their food too, they ended cancelling and leaving too.",2018-01-03T02:48:23Z,273

I like the open air atmosphere, where we had a nice cool breeze coming in during our meal. I had the Rocky Mountain Club, and my wife the Cajun chicken sandwich. The fries are great, and the panko fried pickles were very good also. Service was a little slow to start, but it picked up as the meal went on.

We decided to sat at the bar.
Our bartender was really cold and uninterested. I asked for a description of one beer that he called ""sweet"" and wasn't at all. We ordered food too and he didn't bother to ask us if everything was ok. Had to ask a waitress to ask him for the bill.

900,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Came here on Saturday night around 7ish and it was so busy. There was a seat yourself sign at the front but many of the tables had reserved time on them. Still lost and a bit confused, we just sat at a table that looked free. There was no menu and we hoped someone would passby and offer us some service. Nope. I just walked up to one of the servers and asked if we could order food here or do we have to go downstairs because there's apparently a downstairs to this place. She told me that she'll be right with me. She apologized when she brought over the menus. Not sure if there were any specials that night as she did not mention and we forgot to ask. Menu doesn't have all the items that you see on their website. We wanted to order the quesadilla but it wasn't there and lettuce wrap is also not on the menu. So we got the following.

Food: 

-Stuffed Cannoes (3.5/5-$12): Potato skins stuffed with cheese, guac, bacon bits and tomatoes. They come in fours with sour cream on the side. These were good. You can see that they were freshly prepared as the cheese was still melted and the veggies still looking good. 

-Inferno burger with blue cheese (2.5/5-$15): After having a not so satisfying burger earlier in the week, I decided to get one at the pint in hopes of them doing it better. Still reminiscing the time I had a blue cheese burger and how goo it was, I was indecisive of getting the inferno and the blue cheese so I got a hybrid of the two. Uh...bad choice. The blue cheese was so strong it overpowered any other taste the burger had. To make it worse, the patty was dry and I realized this burger didn't come with lettuce or tomatoes. Also they didn't ask for my meat of choice but whatever, as long as it's not chicken I'm fine. I had the soup of the day as my side. It was tomato soup and it was overly salty. Bleh.

-Farmhouse beef dip (3.5/5-$13): This was pretty darn good compared to my burger. Roast beef served in a pretzel bun with jus on the side. Came with some horseradish too. I liked with or without the jus but no horseradish for me. My friend also got the soup and thought it was way too salty as well. 

Drinks:

-Creamsicle (2.5/5-$10.49): When your drink cost almost as much as your meal, you'd expect better. It was served in a glass boot which we both thought was cute but the creamsicle was supposed to resemble the orange frozen treat. It had the orange taste but for some reason I did not like it. Made me think of some kind of medicine I might have had when I was a kid. 

-Drunken peach (3/5-$10.49): I had better luck with this one. Still not one of those sophisticated drinks I normally like to drink.

-Vodka soda (1/5-$6.50): I may be bias since I don't like vodka to start but I was recommended this drink. It tasted awful. Not sure if it's 'cause I got the house vodka (from the gun) or I just really dislike vodka. Also no fizz.... Tasted like diluted vodka.

902,The Pint Public House,2.9,"The Pint is an awesome place to go if you're a sports and/or wings fan!

On Wednesdays during November when I went, they had a special going on during their Happy Hour, that if a game was on, all 1-pint beer orders came with a free pound of wings (which of course they have well over 30 or 40 sauces/flavours for!). Since there's almost always a game of some kind on it was basically every single Wednesday!

With their member's card/promo card, this promo can be extended to any Wednesday, game or not, and essentially can get you the one order of the ""Happy Hour"" wings deal any time on Wednesday.  Awesome value!

The location is a rough one so I took off a star for that... otherwise it's a very inexpensive place to have good food!",2016-12-21T00:49:51Z,273

They are definitely targeting this place to be a sports bar with an insane amount of TV screens.  The central bar has a lot of stools suitable for pulling up for a pint to watch the game.
While not out on launch day, I have seen they have an over-sized Jenga and Connect 4 set.  Awesome!
As shown in the listing's pictures, there are great specials on Sunday-Thursday with a happy hour from 3-6 each weekday that features $6 for a pint and pound of wings...  great deal...

905,The Pint Public House,2.9,"So, on the way back to our hotel in the rain, people in my group decided to take a bathroom break which morphed into a drinking and snacking session. Boy, was this a good idea. 

FOOD/DRINKS = 4 Stars: The drinks were reasonably priced and my mixed drink was really good. I think everyone had a couple of rounds and were enjoying ourselves so much that I decided to order food. So, we ordered, fish and chips and poutine fries! Poutine is magical... that's all I gotta say.

ATMOSPHERE = 4 Stars: This a bar and it's quite big so you have plenty of space to move about and even sit elsewhere. We migrated from a small table to the bar. It was loud and lively and we enjoyed the setup.

SERVICE = 4 Stars: The bartender was very nice and helpful to us. She was very talkative and personable. It's everything you would look for in a bartender. So, I have no complaints with the service.

RECOMMENDATION: I recommend stopping by this place if you get the chance to try it out and have a drink. Even grab some food if you want. On Friday and Saturday nights (I believe), they have dancing and whatnot so if you get there early enough, then you can hang around and join in on the fun.

Sat in one seat for 10 minutes, only to not have anyone come to our table to take our order.  When the bar area cleared up, we moved to the bar stools.  The bartender totally ignored us and sat on the side, watching the hockey game that was blaring on the TV's and ignoring everyone in need of service.  We took that as a sign they weren't interested in our business, so we left.  Glad we did because our landing spot was excellent.",2019-04-07T05:42:58Z,273
907,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Stopped by here on the way to a soccer game at BC Place, if I could go back in time, the stadium food would have been a Michelin star compared to the wings and fajita wrap I ordered at the Pint.

We came during happy hour so the wings were ""free"" with the purchase of a pint. I now know why they are free, not crispy but instead soft, chewy skin very and barely any sauce.  The fajita wrap was also inedible, not fresh and mushy ingredients inside. They did manage to serve the sweet potato fries well, however, the dipping sauce was warm and seemed like it had been laying on the counter for some time.  I have no trouble eating pub grub but this meal made me lose my appetite.

910,The Pint Public House,2.9,"I've been here three times, and all three times had vastly different atmospheres that leave me slightly confused about my feelings about this place overall.

What's consistent: wings are simply awesome, and having a ton of flavors certainly help. Can't go wrong with the happy hour special of a pound of wings (which amounts to like, 15 of them) and a pint of draft beer. Two of the standout sauces: pineapple curry and bourbon BBQ. 

But each time I went, the crowd was so different. On a Wednesday night, top 40s music was blaring, and people were dancing even though there's no dance floor. The bar was dimly lit, and then an hour later the lights all came back on and weren't turned off for the rest of the night. Weird.

On a game night during the playoffs, the place was busy and buzzing ... and hard not to notice all the guys! It's a guy's place. The third time, right around dinner time, it was kinda dead. 

Still, I like the place for all their specials, and am a fan. You can also order a ""table keg"" of beer, which is freaking awesome.

A few notes about their beer: the Stella on tap seemed drastically watered down. The grapefruit beer is good, and is not overly sour.",2012-06-29T00:00:56Z,273
911,The Pint Public House,2.9,"I'm not a huge fan of pubs and it's not usually my first choice for a place to hang out, but when it's done right, I can appreciate it.

The Pint Public House is pretty happenin' on Saturdays and there's a cover charge after 10:00PM.  The music is pretty good and a section of the restaurant is turned into a dance floor.  The staff here including the bouncer are all pretty friendly and easy to talk to as well.

The best part about this place is that they have specials for food or drinks every single day of the week.  My favorite is the $3 drinks and $4 shots on Sundays.

I went with a friend and ordered 3 beers each total bill was $38.05 before tip? it wasn't packed and the service wasn't great.

914,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Definitely the cheapest place to come for happy hour (free wings with your pint!) and Wing Wednesdays ($4 a pound!), but be warned: you do get what you pay for.

Some downsides... 

My husband and I used to really like coming here, but the quality of food and service has somewhat deteriorated in the past few years. There are a couple of really great waitresses, but on the slow nights and off-peak hours, the quality really suffers and you can get some downright disinterested servers. Sometimes the runners get our food out faster than the server can bring us our drinks! ...but again, there are a COUPLE servers who are goddamned great. You know who you are.

In the past three years, they started putting this cheap, crappy breading on their wings. Bring back the naked wings, please!! My husband won't come here with me anymore because whatever they started putting on the wings makes him have to cower in the bathroom for half an hour after we get home. And the breading just soaks up all the oil and makes the wings taste like garbage/dirty old fryer oil. Oh... and the kitchen is SUPER inconsistent with the dry rub. Sometimes it's heaped on, and other times every single flavour tastes the same because they're sprinkling it on with tweezers or something.

And it costs a dollar for a tiny little cup of hot sauce. I need at least three of these for an evening's worth of wings. Whatever... the wings are still cheap if you come at the right time, so I guess I can't complain too much.

All in all, I'll keep coming back here occasionally if I want some quick, cheap wings. But we've moved on to better places for Wing Wednesday.",2017-03-18T21:57:01Z,273
915,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Went to The Pint for the first time today as it's my boyfriend's favourite place and was hanging out with some friends. It seems to be a very busy place in the later afternoons since we went around 4:30pm and it was already packed so it's difficult to find a seat (it also appears to be a seat yourself kind of place). 

My boyfriend raves about their 40 way chicken wings which is an absolutely crazy amount of flavours! There also happens to be a deal that if you get a beer you get a pound of wings for free. 

Unfortunately based on today's visit, it did not leave a good impression. I understand restaurants can get busy, especially with events going on and other customers all ordering beer and wings. However, my boyfriend and I ended up waiting for an hour for 2 baskets of wings. An hour is a little bit ridiculous especially since we saw an older couple arrive well after we did get their wings while we had already been sitting for 30 minutes at that point. We had asked the server by the 45 minute point if our order has been missed and the response was only that it was very busy, which again is fine but looking around at other customers it seemed like several orders were being mixed up. Best part of it all was that the second batch of wings (Kentucky Bourbon with Blue Cheese Dip) and arrived first even though the order was placed 15 minutes after the first Bach of wings which was Honey Sriracha with Sour Cream. And when the Honey Sriracha wings arrived it was tossed onto the table and server had already walked away without another word. 

TL;DR Server had barely come to our table throughout the entire time and always seemed like she was in a rush to have the least amount of interaction as possible AND waited an hour for 2 baskets of wings. 

While according to my boyfriend this was the first time ever the service was terrible, I'm willing to come again and hopefully next time service will improve.",2018-05-11T05:08:38Z,273
916,The Pint Public House,2.9,"A taste of Fort McMurray in January, right here in Vancouver! Overpriced mediocre bar fare -  clearly everything is coming out of a freezer or jar. (Menu does mention their ""hand-tossed lettuce"" so at least the kitchen staff aren't cyborgs.) I ordered the steak tacos, which were dreadful. The meat was dry, tough, and mostly gristle, likely steak trimmings from the day before. 
Considering that the food ranges from standard to bad, the prices are much too high: Nachos start at $13, and don't include meat or guacamole. Want the large nachos? $22. With guacamole and meat, that means $29. For nachos. Ridiculous, even by Vancouver standards. 
We were on the lower level, which did feature more TV's than I've ever seen in a sports bar. So if you're looking to watch a game or UFC, you could count on a good view of the action regardless of where you're sitting. I still wouldn't go back.",2015-09-21T20:38:44Z,273

I'm sure if you know the employees they'll be able to hook it up after 11pm. We saw one of the waitresses bring out two pitchers for a table next to us after 11pm nearly midnight. She seemed to know them. The DJs music was pretty good mixed in some top 40s throw backs and even music in Spanish. Service was ok and it wasn't too crowded, mainly just around the bar.

919,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Pubs are usually not the place for me. Especially the ones that looks hella sketchy from the outside. If I remember correctly, this place used to be a Lesbian bar... BUT it was changed within the past 2 years, I think :P

I love how this place is all dark and scary on the outside, but once you are inside the bar, it is so lively. The food here is not bad too! The classic perogies are delicious! Perfectly crisp on the outside and melty and gooey on the inside. Delicious!

I love the pint of boots! They are amazing! Huge pints and they are in the shape of boots. I love my fruity drinks, don't mind me please ;)

- hot and sweaty inside (especially downstairs)

922,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Specials! Happy Hours! Fun!
This place is exactly what the area needed.  Yes, there are lots of pubs and sports bars around, but The Pint has none of the pretentiousness, high prices, and snobby staff that are common elsewhere. 

Let's talk about specials.
On Tuesdays, those short ribs are delicious and only $5! Tender, and in your choice of 40 flavours. The game platters are on special for $19, and 2 months later I'm still talking about how I tried to bust through the 9-slider platter with a friend from out of town.

On Wednesdays, the wings are on special (of course), and every day the happy hour special offers you wings and a beer for $6. Try a caesar in a boot sometime. You won't be disappointed.

The Pint is also a solid place to watch a game. TVs are plastered in every available nook and cranny, and every seat is a good one.

I showed up on a Sunday night with a few friends, and the Pint was a downright 90's jam. As much fun as a 20-something's basement party while the parents are away, but I can imagine the rowdiness being a bit too much for anyone wanting to have a conversation.

Keep the good times rolling and the pints flowing.",2012-06-20T18:45:15Z,273

924,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Buy 1 $8 beer & get free wings. 
Probably the worst service & experience ever. 
We first ordered 2 beers & 2 sets of wings. And ordered ranch sauce which she stated ""we charge for it"". Which was fine. $1 for sauce where most places charge $0.25-0.50. The wings came and they were cold & the meat was mushy. The ranch sauce didn't come & we were almost done our wings. Then the manager comes and says there is reservations for this table and will have to move us. Even though the sign says ""reserved until 5pm"". And the time was 5:40pm. He says they are running a little bit late. I'm like, 40 mins late? He's like ""well, I don't know what to tell you, but we told them we would hold their table"". Another 20 mins goes by and the group still hasn't arrive. Finally was able to hunt down our waitress for my ranch even though I only had 2 wings left. So the 2 ranch should have been taken off our bill, but wasn't.  Ordered another set of beer & wings. The wings came, but no beer. Had to chase her down for that. Wings were cold again with nasty garlic powder covered. Meat was also mushy texture. 
We figured, no point complaining cuz they would prob spit in our drinks & food. You never know. At the end of it all, she also messed up the bill. 
I guess people come here thinking it's a good deal. $8 for beer & wings & shitty food/service. No thx.

925,The Pint Public House,2.9,"Fun atmosphere but not good enough to justify the prices. I was amazed to discover on a recent visit that a pint here will set you back $8.50, which is one of the most expensive beers I've had in Vancouver (and it's not even like it's craft beer or anything exotic). 

The cocktails are okay but always have a watered-down feel to me. In fact a recent Vancouver Sun article uncovered that The Pint was not at all living up to its name - they were regularly under-pouring their beers. I'm not sure whether this has changed since then, but nevertheless I can't help but feel like I'm being somewhat ripped off when I come here.

The food is okay - pretty standard stuff to munch on while pursuing the primary goal of getting drunk.

The atmosphere is always busy and fun on evenings and weekends, so it's a good place to hang out before going to a hockey game etc. Other than that, there are way nicer bars in the area that offer better value.",2015-03-16T20:28:30Z,273

Positives: Great beer/wings special, good quick service, central location, lots of seating.

The downstairs gets extremely hot very fast.  There is NO air flow, and I am surprised they did not have any AC going ( or maybe they do not have any).   Up stairs is were all the 19 years old go and hangout.

Men's bathroom like nay club scene  got destroyed upstairs,  someone threw up in the urinal, clogged the urinal and water was everywhere, and no one came and cleaned it up (kind of gross).

Fish & Chips:
Solid meaty planks of Halibut with a light (beer?) batter that enhances the fish!!

3) We couldn't read the menus because we were in the back corner, and they decided not to turn on the lights.
4) We showed up in two groups, the first group ordered before the second group arrived fifteen minutes later, however by the time the second group got their food, one of us in the first group STILL had not gotten their food.
5) At least three of us didn't get our orders correctly (although they did subsidize one of the bills for this)
6) Refills? Second beers? Nope. Did not happen.

937,UBC Dance Club,4.0,"So you wanna learn to ballroom dance?  Don't be telling me you're taking lessons for one reason, and that reason is for that one special day! =P  

This is one of, if not the, cheapest way to learn.  It is through this club.  I first learned here.  Then I moved on to the Grand Ballroom for fun only.  I already knew how to dance by the time I was dancing a bit at the Grand Ballroom.

No, you don't have to be a student to join, but UBC students get a discounted price.  Also, because this is a student club, registration for a term begins in September only.

Andy and Wendy Wong who run the Grand Ballroom got their start here.

To me, this is the best form of entertainment, dance wise.  You go to a ""ball"", YES, a ""BALL""!  In a BALLROOM, and you DANCE.  Cha-cha, rhumba, jive, foxtrot, waltz, and etc.  The first three are the most popular dances with the top 40 music played on the airwaves today.  That's right, you read that correctly. You can use those three dances on most of today's top 40, with the exception of rap music.

No, it is not a nightclub nor disco where there is a certain amount of pretentiousness to it ,and you shake your body to its heart's content.  There are no mind games between the sexes, such as the bitch shield from women, to the drunken creepy male douche-bag.  Men are gentlemen and women are ladies.  Chivalry runs rampant and you behave.  Everyone is there for one reason, and one reason only, dancing, and if you've never been to a ball, it's A LOT OF FUN.  Everybody dances with everybody.  The mindset and vibe is totally different than a nightclub.

As mentioned for my review of the Grand Ballroom, you learn international style standard and latin dances.  I'm not going to get into the details of what that is.

BTW, this is a student club, so the members here are a lot different than the members of the Grand Ballroom, from an age demographic standpoint.  =)

Guys, if you're reading this and you know how to dance, you are light years ahead of 99.9% of the male population out there.",2012-01-11T22:01:22Z,2

939,Boss Night Club,1.5,"Will not return as the experience here was terrible. Before this club was Atlantis, and that was a bit better but since after the club had that ""incident"" with Aaron Chan's case, it changed ONLY the name. It is now Boss. Inside HAS NOT changed at all if you remember the old style of Atlantis. It has been the same since then, and it will forever be the same now.

It is dubbed the Asian club within the city, thanks to all those events done by Envy, DSC and other Asian clubs from UBC/SFU. Anyways, this place really disappoints me to NO ends.... From what I heard is that a lot of people were rejected outside of the club because they had to pay a $20 fee to skip line? I got in because I was with my friends. The staff here are obnoxious and doesn't know any of the drinks that I requested... A Pornstar (How can people not know what this is..) or a screwdriver... REALLY?... I was totally disappointed, how did you even get your bartending license without knowing what a screwdriver is.. UGH. *FLIP TABLE*

The location of the club is terribly placed as it is like in the middle of Yaletown where most people live, but not the Asians that come to this club, sorry. On top of that, i heard many of the neighbors in this area, my friends who live here, dislike the club as it is placed in the wrong area of downtown. They have tried to get it out of the area many times I heard.

The night I attended was K-Pop night, because me and my friends adore K-Pop, only thing was they only played like literally 4 songs, and they were the old stuff like H.O.T and DBSK. Good songs, oldies are good, but most of the people that come here do not know songs like those. It was literally fail. Not even songs from BoA or Lee Hyori was in the mix at all. The rest of they night they just played really bad remixes of TOP40s, worst Lady GaGa remix I have ever heard, worst ever... ew.

I was very disappointed with the place as it really needs to get off their high horse of saying it is the best club in Vancouver. It is just filled with LG/LBs Asians and the DJs has need to learn more about their technique of mixing and create better music. Will never go again. Ew",2011-12-01T07:56:35Z,4
940,Boss Night Club,1.5,"Was there for New Years while on vacation in Vancouver and I have to say this place blows. I bought the tickets online and they wouldn't let people in the door with tickets right away, you had to wait and wait, even though you would probably spend the new year waiting in line.

What sucked about it:

- if you paid an additional $20/per person you could skip the line, which is bullshit if you buy the tickets online. But this is not the worst of it..

- (this is not the clubs fault directly) but finding parking is a bitch. Might as well walk there or get a taxi

- the club doesn't take credit cards. This is the first club I've ever seen that doesn't accept credit cards, which is retarded.

- the dj sucked ass. Putting on the radio would have been better. He kept interrupting every 6 seconds saying his own shit and trying to sing along with the songs which was annoying to hear even when being drunk

- so many asians, I had to check myself in the mirror i hadn't turned into one too.

- people don't know how to walk in here, youll get bumped into over and over again even if you're in the side of the dancefloor and nobody is around you someone manages to walk by you and bump into you. and this is coming from someone who loves clubbing and goes on a regular basis.

- place is small and looks like someones basement

I walked in around 11:45 pm, and there were maybe 20 people in the club.  I literally stood at the entrance for a good 10 minutes waiting for more people to come in, but no one came.  Everything else about the club was awesome, as the drinks were pretty decent, the interior looking classy, the music not half bad, and the few girls that were there looking fly.

It's still an Asian club full of little girls and boys.  It's the *still* the same Saturday night DJs for as long as I can remember.

We rolled in as a tongue-in-cheek throwback to days gone by and because we got an insane hookup on bottle service.  This was the site of many epic stories -- legends were formed and giants tumbled here.

Walk inside and it's not as packed as it used to be... and geez - did we ever feel old.  I might as well have been leaning against the bar, drinking and cracking out, ""That's what I love about these high school girls, man. I get older, they stay the same age.""  The crowd is more or less the same if you've been here in the past several years -- just more fobby and unfriendly.  And like all Asian clubs - no one actually dances - just awkward shuffling, two-stepping and hair-tossing.  But the bouncers are much more chill now.

Due to some bullshit BC liquor laws - no bottle is actually present at the table.  Just all your champagne and liquor poured into a stack of flutes and shot glasses.  I'm certain about half our liquor ended up on the table and floor.

Music is your typical Top 40 - oddly mixed in some house, reggaeton and some bursts of hip-hop.  No consistent vibe and erratic.  Try to please everyone and you'll just piss off everybody.

So - our little throwback urge satisfied, we slammed down the rest of our bottles and rolled the fuck out of there... like a BAWSE!",2011-05-17T10:56:36Z,4

It is not a dance club.  It is a strip club.  Classy? Not so much. lol
It's not like Brandy's it's more like the No. 5 orange if you know what I mean.  There are alot of bars to drink at. Many tables to purchase for viewing or just hanging out (upstairs and downstairs).  

There is great music but no dance floor.  So if you try, it'll be around the stage and very tight.  They sell stacks of $1 dollar american bills for you to throw at the strippers.  They have 4 main strippers that do rotations.  So no need to come early...you'll just see the same girls again.

948,London Pub,2.9,"On a personal note, I think the bar seen in Vancouver is mad weird. Like most bars in Vancouver, people get a drink, keep to themselves or their group of friends. The bar scene in Vancouver is anti-mingle. However, I think London Pub is the secret go to spot in Vancouver where things are different. Everytime I go here, people are so friendly, you can strike a convo with anyone. It's a fun place that tries to bring UK bar vibes to a much needed anti social Vancouver. Last year, I was in this place every Friday night, and some of my best memories from Vancouver are at this place.

I went to one world cup viewing party , and two words: hella fun. I could only imagine UFC nights or other sports viewing parties.

Another thing I like is the bar crowd here is 20s/30s and not your typical 19yo getting plastered with mommy and daddys money on Granville.

Lastly, this is a pub that serves beer and great drinks. They don't serve food, they don't have a kitchen, but you can bring outside food from nearby restaurants in Chinatown. That being said they only make money off of serving drinks, so make sure you be an honest human and tip kindly.",2022-12-07T08:21:49Z,116

But somehow the vibe at the London pub doesn't quite match up with what I was expecting. It's a bit more Granville Street than it is East Van. The music was SUPER loud which really detracted from the pub feel. It was really hard to talk to my friends and I found myself yelling a lot. The music they played was more nightclub than pub (I was there on a Friday night). The bouncer on my night there was quite friendly (which I find is so rare these days) and I didn't have any issues with the bar staff. I think I'd like to swing by during on a week night to see what it's like.",2012-01-25T03:02:08Z,116

The fact that the food is universally disappointing is no revelation so I hope the proprietors tune in.  Whatever your opinion is of Donelly Group pubs the fact is that those types of places are setting the bar because even though their food isn't great you can actually wash it down with 5 pints without wanting to spit it up like a 2 year old eating mashed peas.  Do yourself a favor and make a few things well, at the very least. Also, recommend a few more flat screens in the back by the dart board area.  LP has the right location but if women don't want to come here because they can't eat then men will eventually follow them where they can.",2011-09-07T05:13:15Z,116

I was there with a friend in mid-September and we both had 3 beers and a plate of chicken wings (each). When we went to pay, the waitress said the bill was $64 or $32 each. We both paid separately with credit card, leaving a 15 per cent tip. Next day I noticed my bill said $46. Asked my friend about this and she pulled out her bill for the same. I called the establishment - but it went right to voice mail. Tried emailing and no one has got back to me. I don't live in that area, so going in to speak with the manager isn't an option.

We were either over billed or the Pub is very expensive. To get a $46 bill each, we'd be looking at $7 pints and $15 for a plate of wings (we each had a plate).

Parking is available on the side streets for free, if you come after 2200.

The inside is surprisingly clean - you'd think everything in this part of town would be dumpy.  But nope, the venue is quite well maintained.

Pitchers here range from $13 for their in house London Lager or Ale to $20 for the craft stuff.

A brief, dumb conversation ensued, and a few minutes later she came back again with a very small drink that looked like a lemon drop and said ""sidecars are made with vodka!"" Not when you order a bourbon sidecar they aren't, silly. Get a bartenders bible or (brace yourself) use the Internet next time you don't know how to make a drink.

Good space with ample room so it's impressive that all the tables are filled.  We had a pre-set dinner special of either salmon or chicken that I dont think is typical of their regular pub fare.  I got to taste both and they were pretty good considering this is a pub.  I also set a low bar for food after reading previous reviews.  
My coworker ordered from the menu and had the hummus, poutine and chicken curry.  She rated the food 3.8/5.  The chicken curry was quite good according to her.  I also saw nachos on the table, it looked ok, quite plain with sour cream and salsa.  Nothing remarkable.

Our server did alright serving our large group.  I didn't have to wait long to order drinks and having them come.

The best part about the place is the ""jukebox.""  It is basically like a big ipod on the wall.  Super cool!

1)  The bouncer was the tallest dude I have even seen in my life, but was the nicest guy around.

2)  The beer was reasonably priced and everyone had a good time.  I was the DD that night so I got free coke.  (Coca Cola)  I drank like 7 of them and couldn't sleep all night

3)  Darts are fun!  They waited for us to finish our game before they turned the lights down and spun the 2 dollar disco ball!  It was stupid, but it was fun!

4)  They have TV's and I was able to watch sports while my friends made complete asses of themselves!

5)  The DJ was spinning great music that night.

You need to know where you are going and what function it is going to play in your night for you to have fun.  This wasn't a place for me to go dancing that night and I had already eaten, and it was a bit too loud to chill out and talk, but man did we ever have fun.

Watched lots of games here but on semi-final day for England, lots of unhappy customers outside after they failed to mention you had to be there an hour earlier than kick off (on a work day) to honour any reservations. We even called to ensure our reservation the day before and were told 'yes you'll be fine' again with no mention of the hour early rule. I watched about 100 people turned away because they simply weren't told. Lots of groups of friends were split up, and I ended up at the Ivanhoe with other strangers. 

Shame, as it's a good pub where we've enjoyed the last 5 years of world stage games. Usually friendly with good atmosphere. We agreed we'll be watching all future games at home hosting friends though, as some of us missed the start of the England semi-final and the management were blunt, shouting "" You all have ZERO CHANCE of getting in, try No.5 Orange"" to a disappointed crowd outside.

989,London Pub,2.9,"This place IS A-OK.

For whatever reason, most weekday afternoons I find myself in and around this area for meetings. Generally this means bopping back and forth between coffee houses but occasionally, if the mood strikes, it requires brainstorming over a beer.

Fun fact - when you wander into Chinatown looking for a brew at 3pm, this is really one of the only spots that is open. Which is why i'm thankful that is has some good stuff going for it.

Why i'm a fan:

1. They have a great beer selection and have a hefty portion of their list boasting local brew. This always makes me exceptionally happy.

2. They carry large bottles of Phillips Long Boat Chocolate Porter - which is my rainy day beer and also the perfect size to split.

3. Even though I find the service is sometimes pretty cookie cutter, they hit some great notes. Half way through our beer, we thought we had a dirty glass. They replaced it AND the 650ml bottle no problem and without making us feel like villains for pointing out a negative. I always like when this happens... because in my books, most negatives can be cancelled out or turned positive simply by how it's dealt with. Good service is gold. Tip of the hat for turning this.

Why I'm not an uber fan:

1. It's a little impersonally big and shiny to be considered a ""pub"". I'm a Maritimes girl so I like my pubs to be a little cozier. For a large party or a business brew, it's a decent spot, but I wouldn't be tempted to come back and curl up apres work.

2. Their wifi drives me bonkers. For some reason, I spend half of my time battling it. Huge pet peeve.

Never had the food so cannot comment on that. Until a later date I suppose.

Wings overcooked  (severe) good sauce but no blue cheese or veggies ($11 !!!! is one of the highest wing Wednesday prices in Vancouver)

Nacho's no meat, no Jalapeños, Guacamole was an extra $4, we could only stomach 1/2 they were that bad.

However, they are not just a drinking establishment, now are they? No, the London Pub also offers food. Or, should I say ""food.""

Everything ordered at our table was terrible, with only one exception (the mashed potatoes and onion gravy). The veggie pizza was a salt lick, with scads of plastic-y tasting cheese and clearly canned or jarred sauce. I have had better pizza in Laos. :l 

The pretzel was bland, owing to the fact it lacked coarse salt and mustard.  ?  It was served with a cheese dip that shared more than one characteristic with vomit - I'm still gagging over it. My BFF claims that her nachos on a previous visit were microwaved!

The boy was heard to remark ""It's like they've heard of food, but never actually eaten any....""

All this, and at prices wayyyy higher than other solid locals like Five Point, the Whip etc. I may be back for drinks ONLY, but our Sunday Night Social Club will never be returning.",2011-02-14T21:50:10Z,116
992,London Pub,2.9,"The London Pub is alright if you don't plan to eat any of the food. I've been here a few times now but last night I stopped in for a friend's birthday and was served a pizza that despite my raging hunger and slight drunkenness, I could barely get halfway through. That's pretty bad, considering that in a drunken state I will eat ANYTHING.

The best part is that I didn't even order a pizza. I actually asked for the Veggie Quesadilla with no red peppers. I guess she either misheard or forgot and I was presented with the Veggie Pizza (I didn't even see pizza on the menu!). 

The waitress sort of offered to send it back and put in my original order, but then excitedly suggested that she give it to me for the price of the quesadilla. Ok, I get it. You're really busy and you don't want to deal with your own mistake. Fine, whatever. I sat there for about 10 minutes picking off all the olives (but hey, at least she remembered that I don't like red peppers!) and dug in. Blech.

I'm just going to say right now that the pizza they serve at 7-11 is ACTUALLY better than this. I know there must have been sauce, because I could see red inside, but it was horribly dry and tasteless.

The guy sitting next to me got the Veggie Quesadilla (no fair..) and when we asked him how it was he just shrugged. That made me feel a little bit better.

I noticed some people down at the end of our table ordered the giant pretzels with cheese dip. THESE ARE NOT PRETZELS. They came with NO SALT. What the fuck kind of game are you playing London Pub?

There were some redeeming qualities about the London Pub though, which is why they get a second star! Yipee!

First of all, I like the layout. It's nice and open and I love all the brick walls.

The music! When I was attempting to get through my pizza ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" came on. I was actually going to write a review about the pizza by changing the lyrics to that song into lyrics about cheese. I'm too lazy though.

So yeah, come for the drinks and hang out, but make sure you eat first.",2011-05-14T23:44:15Z,116
993,London Pub,2.9,"Wonderful looking room, nice layout, good beer selection. Unfortunately that's about all I can say that's good about the London.  

The service is downright terrible - I don't know if they have a special hiring hall for servers who don't give a damn but they've certainly done an excellent job if that's what they were going for.  I've been back probably about a half dozen times now - I really do not recommend eating there.  Mostly I've ended up at the London due to social obligation rather than by actual choice.

It's the little things, like walking to the bar to get a drink and having the bar staff outright ignore you.  No ""hello!"" or ""I'll be with you in just a second!"", just straight up completely won't make eye contact.  You stand there wondering if there's a big sign above your head saying ""NO BAR SERVICE"" or something that you should have noticed.  Or how the servers are often standing around doing nothing (unless they get paid to ignore the customers), yet there's a huge wait to get a beer or a menu.

The food is mostly reheated frozen crap.  I would highly recommend the pizza-by-the-slice place across the street - he at least uses fresh ingredients for everything.  Hell the London can't even get nachos right!

In the end I give 2 stars purely for the beer selection, clean bathrooms and the pinball machines.  But let me tell you they've barely got that second star locked down in my mind.",2011-11-29T22:40:24Z,116
994,London Pub,2.9,"I joined yelp just to write this review. As others have said ""I really wanted to love this place"" but I guess it wasn't meant to be. So here is my review;  My parents were in town and we were wanting to go to Phnom Penh for their infamous squid and wings but, the line was 40-50 minutes and we were on a bit of a time line so we opted to go to the London Pub. I am going to make a list of what was bad about it to make this easy.

My London Pub review list:

1. Server looked and acted like she hated her life and her job wouldn't even make eye contact with any of us.

2. Server ""forgot"" to tell us what they were out of and that their deep fryer was broken as we were about to order. Which made a few people change their choices

3. The food took forever! 43 minutes to be exact! we could  of had our squid and wings!

4. The  food was bad, we saw my pizza come out to the wrong table about 30 minutes before everyone esle got theirs so it sat under the heat lamp for a very long time ""chewy"". My siblings had the beef dip and the salmon saladin. The beef dip ""au jus"" was spilt by either the server or the cook into the side salad making it a beefy salad. My brothers salmon was the same salad as the beef deep but with stale pecans and a piece of steamed salmon with Kraft bbq drizzled on the top. My gf ordered the edamame and it was covered in way too much rock salt. Oh and I almost forgot the salads were made with the bitter yellow parts of the hearts of romaine lettuce

5. It was 2 in the afternoon and we were the only ones ordering food I have no idea how it took so long and why it was so bad

It was honestly the worst meal I have ever had, I was hoping the drink selection was going to be good but sadly nope. With a limited tap range and ""Fullers"" everything which is a giant macro from england it makes this place a fail. Save your time and money and when in the area wait the 40 min for Squid and Wings or head over to gas town to the Alibi room or even Steamworks.",2011-04-19T03:03:19Z,116

We came here for an event with about 50+ other people. The atmosphere was surprisingly nice and the décor was interesting. We all ordered a bunch of appetisers to share which were good.

We ordered two ciders for ourselves. It was a bit loud, so I pointed out what we wanted on the menu. I wanted to pay for the drinks right away but the waitress insisted we open a tab.

We and a couple friends went over to play pool; we were a bit annoyed that it was coin-operated (who brings coins to a pub??). We got that sorted, but then had to go find the cue-ball. It would have been nice if there was a sign to let us know we had to get it from the bar.

As the night went on, we ordered a few more rounds of drinks, and then checked out. However, when the bill came, I discovered the waitress had been ordering us a more expensive cider instead of the one I had asked for. Looking back, now I see why the waitress insisted on a tab.

Quite a shame as I would have otherwise been back.",2013-12-14T20:23:43Z,116

But then again, if you are really invested in going deaf while having meaningless conversation with yourself, the London Pub works. 

I am also not a fan of endless banks of TV screens. The ones in the London Pub often feature random images of brain-damaged UFC fighters chewing on one another in cages.  Then again, they could be reciting OSCAR WILDE (WHAT?) for all I know; I can't hear a word due to the din of the sound system. 

Bottom line: if you are soooo bored by the company you keep that you enjoy pointless monosyllabic conversation and getting mindlessly distracted ....by by by by by by... huh? where am i?... oh yeah...video, then BOOYAH!! the London Pub is a great place to be Friday night.

PS. If you really REALLY need to drink beer in an atmosphere that sounds like rottweilers barking to Nickelback in reverb-verb-erb-erb, you could also set up a half dozen truck-sized speakers in a Quanset hut...",2012-01-05T05:15:47Z,116
997,London Pub,2.9,"I came here to grab a quick bite to eat before work and found it a bit... lacking I suppose. My food experience wasn't as bad as everyone else's, but after reading the other reviews on here i'm starting to feel like I lucked out!

The service was pretty so-so. I sat at a table for over 5 minutes waiting for someone to take my order, and while I know five minutes doesn't SOUND like a long time, it sure does feel like it when you're on your own in a place that isn't busy. I think only five or six other parties where there, and I could see the waitresses across the room chatting next to the bar. Maybe the place being called a pub threw me off, because to me that suggests you can pop in for a quick bite to eat and a drink and receive good, no frills service.

When a server finally came, she looked at me, then looked at the table next to me with four people waiting (who had just sat down a few minutes before) and walked over to their table. I was pretty insulted because she actually made eye contact with me, then decided to go to the table with more people, possibly since she'd be getting a bigger tip.

I then went up to the bar to order a drink and my food. The bartender must be used to people complaining about the servers because before I even opened my mouth he apologized for them basically ignoring me and said he'd make sure I got my food quickly.

I ordered a caesar and daily sandwich special, which was Montreal smoked meat. It was actually pretty damn good! Greasy and salty, but that's pretty much what you're expecting with that sort of dish! My caesar was also quite delish, and while i won't be back anytime soon because of the poor service, i'll keep it in mind as the only place in the area where i can order a caesar that has some fixings (aka: yummy yummy beans!). The bartender and the good caesar are basically bumped this up from a one star review to a two!

The bartender actually ended up bringing me my food, and it was after this point that one of the waitresses finally came over and asked how the food was. At the end of the meal, she was the one who brought me my bill. She didn't get a tip, but 15% did go into the bartender's tip jar!

And as for the place itself... I like the brick walls and big windows, but this place seems guilty of trying too hard to be something. You can tell they spent a lot of money on hiring graphic designers and decorators to mimic the logos and look of an English pub, but between the cookie-cutter waitresses and boring lacquered wood decor you see all over Vancouver, it doesn't have enough character to fill a pint glass.",2011-10-15T23:25:16Z,116
998,London Pub,2.9,"I haven't been anywhere where they carded you at the door in a looooong time. Therefore, in honour of said occasion I have compiled a list of pros and cons:
 
PROS
- carded at the door! woot woot! zing!
- casual spot where you can actually stand around chatting and not be forced into your seat by militant hostess for being a fire hazard
- loud music forcing close contact conversation with cute members of opposite sex (like i need an excuse)
- cheap beer hazah!

CONS
- constant thought of ""god i wish they would turn down the music a bit"", i.e. i am old 
- annoying bathroom girls (omg like, so totally, like, freakin, like awesome!)
- trying to find coat/purse in the large heap we amassed in the corner
- the only black/brown people in here (excluding myself...and i only count for half) are the bouncers. suspect. 
- ringing in ears the next morning and acknowledgment that i've probably sped up the deafening process by a good year",2012-01-31T04:06:26Z,116
999,London Pub,2.9,"There's a lot of open space in here which I think is a good thing - you don't feel trapped at tight tables even when there are a lot of people in the bar, like you might at other similar places. I like the exposed brick, the pillars, the pool table, and the big windows. Lots of TVs showing sports if there's something you want to watch - or you can easily ignore them if that's not what you came here for. I like the location and the fact that London Pub is just part of a collective effort at rejuvenating the Main-Street-South-of-Chinatown area.

And on to the bad:

Despite a decent beer menu and interesting cask night specials, the beer prices are way too high. A pint of Guinness is $8.50 (the menu says $7.60 but then they add tax to that). I guess that's a 20oz pint but still seems a little high to me. $8.50+tip is almost $10 for a beer. The local stuff is cheaper but not much.

Our waitress had a lot of attitude. I don't know if it's because there was a fundraiser that night and she was expecting low tips, or if it's because I look like the guy who ran over her cat, but she was kind of snappy. My friends who got there before me said she'd been like that all evening.

And lastly... the music is too loud! I can't hear what anyone is saying! There was a guy playing guitar live and he was actually pretty good, it's a shame it was so loud that I couldn't hear my thoughts well enough to form a coherent opinion about it.",2012-06-22T22:59:51Z,116

1001,London Pub,2.9,"Was excited to check the new watering hole in chinatown. It's about time. So glad to see the previous purple dive bar gas given way to a beautiful space of warmth created with  brick, moulded archways and nice dark wood. 

We figured that a Tuesday evening was good night to check it out. The place was pretty busy due to the hockey game. 

I ordered the roasted garlic and chicken pizza, it was alright. Can't say that I'd order it again. 

The other menu items ordered at our table consisted a the veggie pizza, beef dip and quesadilla.

Not one person at the table declared their food amazing. It simply filled the void that was in our stomachs.

Large selection of beers, a bit pricey for neighborhood, but I guess thats how they'll keep the previous clientele from returning.

The reason I give this place 2 stars us that the service was horrendous. I was very apparent that our server was nit impressed with her job. Everyones entitled to an off day, but if you are in the service industry like I have been for many years you need to suck it up and do your job or quit and find something you like doing. 20 mins before taking the drink order in a pub is not acceptable. 

Overall, I really want to like this place and am hopeful that it will improve with time.",2011-01-01T16:30:52Z,116
1002,London Pub,2.9,"Knowing that this is a pub, I knew the food wasn't going to be that great.  Fine.  I can accept that.  But when you get members of your staff, mainly the waitresses, who look like they could care less about serving you, this really tells what kind of pub London Pub is...

Attention London Pub owners.  If you want your pub to not close down in the next year or two, hire waitresses who actually pay attention to your customers or at least competent enough to remember ONE ITEM that was requested! The waitress (Amanada M) ""forgot"" my order THREE TIMES!  She was more interested in chatting up with fellow co-workers than serving the customers.  And btw, there were probably less than 15 patrons in the bar.  WTF.

Server was polite and friendly. She hovered long enough to see if we needed anything without being creepy. Helped us take care of our cheques efficiently. 

The bar was dark, a little dingy, but seemed clean to me. They were playing the Seattle vs. Carolina (American) football game when we walked in, and there was a pretty decent crowd watching. Exclamations and shouts at the TV are encouraged here.

At 730pm, the noise level was pretty average and the bar was roomy. By the time it hit 930-10pm, there was a bouncer at the door, the bar was completely full, the disco ball was spinning and a live DJ appeared out of nowhere. Noise level went from 0-100 real quick.

Extensive beer selection. But lacking on the selection of food. We had a couple of shareable appies (nachos, chicken strips and fries) that were alright. I did like the honey mustard sauce though. My friend got the beef dip, which was a little on the dry side. The pizza and the wings were average. 

Left a little bit before 11:00pm because the crowd was getting too intense for my liking. But I'm keeping this place in the back of my mind for any future hockey games, (European/American) football games and PPV fights.",2015-01-12T23:29:36Z,116

So after getting to mash potatoes with industrial size mashers (cool!), passing on hot pan after hot pan of turkeys and veggies (ouch!), I was really tired and my fingers and wrists were raw from burned (boo!).  

However, walking into the warm, brick walled pub was the relief I needed and my beer was soothing to the soul.  I especially love the high ceilings and arches of the space--it's a cool place to hang (flat screen televisions, darts, pool table, jukebox, etc.) for grown up kids who appreciate ambiance.  I'd definitely come back to catch up with friends or watch a game.

Plenty of beer choices and drinks, the nachos came out stacked and overflowing, and our service was friendly and attentive.  What more could you ask for after a hard day's work???",2010-12-23T08:40:55Z,116

Casks open at 5pm. It takes 20 minutes to get that beer. It says mint and honey ale. It tastes like wheat ale, with barely a hint of mint. Where was the honey? It was still good, but tasted like your standard ale.

He asks ""What's the lightest thing you have on the menu?"" Her ""Umm..."" I say ""get the london lager.""  It was light. I was right.

1006,London Pub,2.9,"I really wanted to love this place.  And I think if I only had drinks I would have.... but I ate.  So I am sticking with the two stars.

Lets start with the good - lots of tables that are easy to pull together.. so it makes sense for an after work sort of place. Pool tables and a jukebox add an extra fun element.  But it feels too wide open to me - like you are in a hall instead of a pub?  They have half pints on the menu - which lets you sample some new beers without committing to a huge pint! LOVE that.  I also love that they have Friday cask night, and a pretty good beer list for us snobs out there.  

But the food.  Meh the food.  Everything sounded awesome on the menu... but after arriving to the table the consensus was a resounding meh.  It was way below average pub food at pretty high prices.  

**Attention vegans - pretty sure the veggie meatloaf burger has cheese in it.  Although I couldn't really get a straight answer regarding the ingredient list.  Oh and it's awful**",2011-03-22T15:47:00Z,116

1009,London Pub,2.9,"I went in here with people from our baseball team the other night after a game. It was a real disappointment. 

I explained to the waitress that we needed a table for seven. There were several tables for eight to ten, but all had one or two people sitting at them. She basically told me to figure it out on my own. 

After negotiating our own table, we ordered beers which were good (kinda hard to mess that up though).  

Everyone was disappointed with the food. My chilli verde cheese fries were only okay, but not for $10. More like a $6 plate. The steak and Guinness pies were just Luke warm in the middle; obviously not microwaved long enough. The chilli verde was like soggy peppers in watered down BBQ sauce. It wasn't even remotely green in colour.  The prices were steep considering the marginal quality. The random chicken wing that accidentally found its way into my chilli fries was the highlight of the meal. 

Some friends recently told me the food at London Pub was pretty good; this night however they were eating their words and nut finishing the food.

 It might have been one of those cases where a restaurant bring in a consulting chef to kick up the food quality. If so, the regular staff is really letting the quality slide.

Lots of pretty girls and unpretentious patrons, great music( Dj) , packed dance floor, pool table ( although difficult to get more than a couple games in on a Friday night), clean bathrooms, & a friendly bar staff.

Good happy hour drink specials, and always a good choice for those sunny weekends when we feel like playing pool since people usually flock to patios. Pool is only $1 so probably the cheapest around, and always great with a couple rounds of beer. 

Food is very average, nothing to write home about. You get what you pay for here.",2016-04-06T19:18:41Z,116
1013,London Pub,2.9,"We went here on a Friday night for a couple of drinks and some food.  We ordered the goat cheese and roasted veggie, and roasted garlic and chicken pizza's.  Neither were very good.  I didn't actually like the crust  and the pizza was dry as it had too few toppings.  The people next to us had the bangers and mash and pretty much licked the plate clean so that might be a sign that there are better options.

I had the London bitters and a glass of the cask special which was a vanilla stout. The drinks were good and were refilled with amazing speed as we were sitting at the bar.  The music was OK, but a little eclectic.  The crowd on a Friday consisted mainly of mid-20's folk and a few old timers like us.  The space is pretty cool.  It  is really big, has high ceilings, and they have highlighted a lot of the heritage features.  It is actually a great space and the renovations they have done here are actually really nice.

I thought the menu and the drinks were both over priced.  Seriously a pint of Strongbow for $7.75? The price of a can of Red Racer IPA is a laughable $6.25. Their own brand of draught is pretty affordable though at $4.50 a pint.  I would consider coming back for a casual drink with friends. Definitely not a place I would go for a bite to eat.",2011-01-15T08:52:10Z,116
1014,London Pub,2.9,"I didn't expect much, to be honest. I usually don't when I go to pubs. I came here for a Canucks game, but I didn't expect to be able to eat anything from the menu. Turns out I could - the immam bayaldi. I don't recommend it, unfortunately. Cold, undercooked eggplant cubes with HP sauce and some roasted red peppers from a jar served with warmed naan bread. Still, at least there was something vegan.

There's a pinball machine. Awesome. The beer was cheap, too - we drank ""London Ale"", which is produced by Russell Brewing, and in honour of the Canucks game were entered into a raffle for each beer we purchased. I wound up winning a Canucks jersey thanks to that.

So, while the food was mediocre, the beer was affordable, and we had a really great time. It's hard to tell how good the service was because the bar was packed to capacity and everyone was paying attention to the TVs (one of which was a projector screen - thank you!) but we definitely didn't have any problems with the service.",2011-05-31T16:58:25Z,116

The goods: 
The staff/management - all very friendly and efficient 
The off sale selection - tons of local craft beer big bottles
Pinball - two of the best machines available.
Venue for sports viewing - Hockey, UFC, Soccer whatever your into this is a great place to watch a game.
Variety of beer on tap - you will find something you like.
The soup and sandwich daily special for 10$ albeit hit or miss it is usually pretty good, and the only reasonably priced food item on the menu.

Nice to see the place renovated. Chinatown is certain on the way up.

Love the open feel of the place and the assortment of beer selection.  Cool to see that this place has a pool table and a dart board.  Don't see that much anymore.  Nice coozy feel with exposed brick support columns.  So definitely an A plus for a place to watch the game or hang out with friends.

Different story if you are looking to eat:  They need help, a lot of help.  I ordered the bangers and mash - bangers were oversized breakfast sausage and mash was tasteless.  My friend ordered wings and said that they were poor.  (This guy is a wing nut too).

So D was meeting some friends here to celebrate being Ayyrish... We parked near the park one street over... under a street lamp... but what I should have done was park across the street on Main because I think it was free... and I could watch it from our table inside the pub.

When we arrived, there wasn't a line yet, but a bouncer was outside checking IDs. It was packed inside though. There were nine girls packed around a table with four chairs. We lurked around some other tables close to us, but no dice. We ended up having to eat in shifts. 

We forced my fiance to drink two Guiness before being able to eat; we came late so we were the 2nd shift. I ordered the beef dip and my fiance had the steak pie. Yum, I loved my beef dip. I didn't get enough au jus though... sure I got a small ramiken, but I needed more. The beef was tender and the bread was nicely toasted, and it was just so nice to dip every bite in the salty, beefy-ness. I even dipped a couple of the kettle chips in it. I wondered if they made them in-house. They were nice and warm and plentiful. Someone else at the table got their beef dip with salad. Phssh. Salad.

1022,London Pub,2.9,"I was really hoping this would be good since it's a part of my neighborhood and close to my house. The reality is that the food here was horrible.

The bangers and mash came with sausages that tasted like really bad frozen breakfast links. The mashed potatoes were advertised as garlic mash, pretty sure there wasn't a single clove of garlic in them.

The fish and chips were quite possibly the worst I've ever eaten. The fish was hard and not all flaky, almost as if it was pressed down. It was also obvious that it was previously frozen. The batter was thick and in no way a beer batter as was advertised. The coleslaw that came with it had to have been days old and not refrigerated as it was wilted and tasted foul. If you're going to position yourself as British pub you should at the very least have your fish and chips figured out, it's not that hard.

The service was horrible. No one seated us when we walked in. Our server acted like we were inconveniencing her by showing up. We never had our waters topped up, were never asked if we wanted more drinks, nor were we asked if we were enjoying our food. When the waitress did finally come back to our table we informed her how bad the food was. Her response was ""I've heard that a lot"".

Pizza was just right, not greasy, even dough and good balance of the ingredients.  Nachos were awesome, tonnes of toppings layer after layer.  Warm pretzel was ok, but the jalapeno dipping sauce was fantastic, albeit a little pricey.  Had great service as well, waitress made sure we were never too close to empty with our pitchers.  All in all, another great night. 

Not sure if its a hit or miss with the servers and kitchen staff, but I've had 2/2 so far.  I'm seeing a pattern where patrons visiting on a weekday don't seem to get the same quality of service/food than on a weekend night.  Could be the reason for the inconsistency?",2011-01-06T00:15:54Z,116
1027,London Pub,2.9,"This has become our usual post-soccer game hangout for beers and, occasionally, food. I like it because it's very casual and laid back, two essential qualities for a pub if you're a group of people showing up post-game with shin pads and soccer cleats in tow. (Mind you I have only been here on a Sunday afternoon/evening, which I'm sure must be way more chill than a busy Friday or Saturday night, although there is still always lots going on.) The service is fast and friendly, the clientele is interesting, and the music is usually decent. 

I don't drink beer, so I can't speak for the beers on tap, but I enjoy their selection of ciders and other drinks. I was also pleasantly surprised by the nachos, which were way better and came with way more topping than I was expecting. Either we worked up an appetite or they must have been really good nachos (or both, I suspect), because our group started with most people saying ""no thanks, I don't want any"" and yet we devoured the entire huge plate no problem within a short period of time!

My only minor complaint is that they don't have a portable debit/credit machine, so once you get your bill you have to flag down a server and drag them over to the corner to run your card. Not a big deal but slightly annoying when the servers are really busy.

The atmosphere and reasonable prices make this the perfect place to kick back after the game or to watch soccer, football or hockey on their TVs; I'm sure we'll be back soon for more victory beers.",2012-03-23T16:38:59Z,116

This year, I spent it here; and picking the right place for Paddy's day is no small feat.  The several times I have been here I have been impressed.  The atmosphere is good, its big, has lots of 'mingle space', and the bartenders are always friendly and fantastic at serving up yummy drinks and shots, with as little direction as ""make it a nice one', or 'make this one hurt'.

The server acted like she'd rather be anywhere else, and the general vibe from staff was uncomfortable. Then when it came time to pay, was told they didn't accept debit. So the bank machine they have charges you $2.50 to use. I felt ripped off and I really believe nobody at this dump really cares.",2015-05-06T17:58:01Z,116

1033,London Pub,2.9,"I've been hear  a few times, generally late on a Friday or Saturday night and it's fast becoming one of my favourite night spots in Vancouver. No cover, great beer selection, not too crowded, reasonably priced and a really varied crowd. 

I can't speak to the food, but if you're looking for a late night drink with friends or just a stop on the way to a more ""nightclub-y"" I highly recommend it.",2011-11-06T01:15:50Z,116
1034,London Pub,2.9,"The skinny: pool (not free), pinball, darts, jukebox and $13 pitchers of house draught everyday (choice of lager, ale or bitter) and $4.50 for a pint.  HST included.  Sweet.

I was lurking around Chinatown on a reconnaissance mission and happened upon London Pub.  It's a spacious, dark and dank drinkhole with dark wood tables and exposed brick walls.  Very pub like yet very modern.  They have a lot of tall stool seating too - which I'm inexplicably attracted to - maybe because I like to imagine I'm 7 and dangle my legs.  Tall tables were at the perfect height too - that perfect ""plant your elbows and drink some beers"" height.

The large windows looking out on to the Main St. lights kinda throws off the feel - but it gives it an almost Gastown feel.  This place feels extremely out of place in in this area, yet it's desperately needed in the changing face of the Vancouver Chinatown scene.  A step up from the dive bars (Cobalt & Ivanhoe) to the south and not as frou-frou as the chic bars to the north (Keefer Bar & Bao Bei).  I nearly forgot I was in Chinatown until I was outside and a drug-addled lady of the night who had fished out a cigarette butt off the ground asked me for a light.  Good old Chinatown - the streets that raised me.

I didn't order any of the food - but it's mainly mid-priced English food like curries, meat pies and bangers and it didn't tempt me.  If only any of the delectable Chinatown eateries were open past 7PM, the area has amazing potential.  But the London Ale I had was pretty sweet and service was prompt.

Anyways - cheap draught beer by the pitcher, great selection of bottled craft beer (and a bunch of British beer if that's your thing) and they tap a new cask every Friday night.  Okay - I'm about ready to declare this *my* bar.",2011-01-20T09:01:15Z,116

We were both pretty excited about check out the London Pub because it looked like a pretty cool Pub and close to home.
Unfortunately the whole experience was pretty bunk.

The food was terrible.
It was tasteless and bland.  

Drinks took forever to come and service was pretty much non-existent.

1036,London Pub,2.9,"I had a very bad experience at this pub.

I came to the London Pub, after having a dinner with my co-workers and potential clients. There were about 15 of us, who had arrived via different taxis. More than half of my group had already entered and I waited outside to greet the remainder.

When we walked up to the door, the bouncer told us there was a $20 cover charge. One of my friends who had previously entered the pub came outside and told us that they did not have to pay anything to enter.

I spoke to the bouncer saying that our friends were inside and they did not have to pay cover. He mentioned to me that if we wanted to get in and ""skip the line"" (that was non-existent), we would have to pay $20 per person. 

I felt intimidated and a little embarrassed with the situation. Half of my group was already inside having drinks. The bouncer let me go to the ATM inside to withdraw enough so that I could pay for the rest to enter, while he did not let some of my co-workers enter. I paid $120.00 to enter, called the club and they said sorry.

I am very disappointed with the situation and the way it was handled and I hope people think twice about attending an establishment with these types of business practices.",2013-11-28T09:24:13Z,116

Any one indiscretion could have been forgiven. They were short staffed and apparently the chef was new. 

The server was apologetic and they comped us a single drink for the poor food and service. I would expect a pub that's been a part of the Chinatown community for as long as they claim would be more accommodating to a busy community event.",2015-02-22T23:12:20Z,116

Everyone seems to be into MMA these days, but I'm glad London Pub, perhaps owing to its English roots, still has respect for the sweet science.  $5 cover was definitely worth it.

1043,London Pub,2.9,"""OK I guess""

that was the general consensus after visiting The London Pub.

They did a pretty nice reno job, although the unfortunate result of said reno and removing the old drop ceiling is that the acoustics here are quite horrible. Conversations, music and televisions compete and combine to create a cacophonous din. 

The layout could have benefitted with the inclusion of more 'nooks' (like a proper British pub) - between the acoustics and the beer hall style floor plan, this really is not a spot for quiet pints with friends.

Despite heritage of the building, the pub itself could be pretty much anywhere.. London? more like Sports Bar U.S.A...

The good news is reasonably priced beer and a decent selection of off-sales.

The off-sales are a welcome addition for Strathcona, where off-sales selection is typically limited to cans of PBR or similar type dreck.. London Pub offers big bottles of Russell beers and tall boys of Barcelona Estrella Damm - kudos for that.

Not a bad spot to meet up en route to somewhere better or to grab a couple of quick pints, but if you are looking to hang out or have a conversation with friends - I'd suggest the Brickhouse next door.",2011-02-01T00:30:03Z,116

1046,Pat’s Pub,3.8,"Sunny day on a Sunday in Vancouver.   The big yellow ball in the sky is hurting my eyes and is making my skin tingle.  

Pat's has been in existence for so long that time has forgotten its origin.  As I entered the double-doors, build in a time when an airlock was necessary to keep out the cold, I wondered whether the staff at Pat's get tired of cooking the delightful and whimsical meals they are known for. I have these thoughts only because I have never eaten at Pat's before.  No other restaurant in the Vancouver area makes simple brunch seem so full of the promise of sheer delight. 

The thrills are sometimes subtle, like the way one needs to order and pay before service, or the fact the experience is an unusual combination of cafeteria-style counter self-service and pub decor.  I particularly enjoyed the discussion with our server about how the cook was refusing to cook one of the meals we had paid for - until the cook could confirm that we had, in fact, paid for it.  Good thing we had our receipt, which the server borrowed to show the cook. This cook versus server drama was a crispy pleasurable bit of theater that makes a visit to Pat's a unique joy. 

Pat's is a restaurant/pub determined to stay true to its history, keeping its rich, dark interior full of those non-franchise pub elements that are becoming extinct everywhere else.  The brick walls, deep brown and red wood panels and tables are an inviting cloak to Vancouverites who are repelled by the sun.  For those others, there are a few window seats. And the view out of the window seats offer a great visual experience full of strangeness and otherworldliness not seen outside of East Hastings, or the Surrey Tent City. I recommend a window seat if you can get one.        
The Pat's deep repertory is refreshing for anyone who lives outside of East Hastings or Surrey Tent City and should not be missed.  It may be seen by some as a risk but truth be told, we felt safe although a bit uncomfortable while walking outside.  This sense of adventure, of course, is one source of Pat's enduring success. I do not hesitate to say it: today everyone should make their way to accept and take on this wonderful experience and be richer for it.  

The food at Pat's is out of place in a good way.  Had the executive chef tossed in a sprig of parsley, the platting would have been comfortable in a Micheline Star restaurant,  but not a real Michelin star restaurant.  The food was a sense-stealer, with the eggs benedict shrouded by a creamy pool of sauce, not at all Hollandaise in appearance or colour, but deliriously tasty in any event.  The hash browns soaked-up the egg yolks and, smothered in ketchup, thrilled the taste buds.  The coffee was rich with a Starbucks depth of flavour.  Although this is a largely self-serve place, our server brought refills frequently.  

Our server, who was also the cashier, was enjoyable and attentive despite his obvious conflict with the kitchen.    
I admit that I blinked my eyes a few times at entering Pat's, but why worry, experiences like this might not come again. A year from now the decrepit hotel in which Pat's is located, may well have made way for a new crop of condos made to look like they are built out of containers.

The location is somewhat sketchy- definitely not in the best part of town. Got harassed on the walk to and from the car. That was probably the biggest damper on or experience.

1049,Pat’s Pub,3.8,"I've lived in Vancouver my whole life so thought I would have heard if there was a century old venue still in existence that is woven into the very DNA of jazz itself.  

The Patricia hotel, to me, is somewhere I steered clear of most of my life. I just never gave it a second look and assumed it was a place you just didn't want to end up.  As it turns out, it is the hub of a scene,.. or many scenes, of music, and the venue itself is neither grody, nor a place to avoid.  

Inside it is more 70s than turn of the century, but not ""old"",.. more like retro reno and clean, with nice bathrooms and all! 

The food was decent too and they brew beer on premises that I really liked.  The burgers are not frozen and my friend's pulled pork poutine looked amazing. 

The night we went was the ""early seating for music on Saturday which is 3pm-7pm for jazz and there was a hardcore audience there (multi-generational),  The host was a true enthusiast of jazz and also helped deliver the food,.. I felt that added to it and would go back to this great new find.

Their stout and porter are excellent and I enjoyed their chicken wings and onions rings. The only downside is that the bartender is often absent. Whenever I come to the bar for a refill, I have to wait in line for her return. (I guess, to cut costs, they have her multi-tasking out back.)

1053,Pat’s Pub,3.8,"I came to Pat's based on the reviews I read here on yelp*  They weren't all good, but they weren't horrible, either.  The concerns raised (personal safety in this particular neighborhood) didn't seem insurmountable, to me.

I checked out the web site, too and found that there was a Jazz Quartet performing close to the time we wanted to visit, so we made sure we got there in time for some good local, live jazz.

We arrived and Pat's was packed, lots and lots of people clearly there for the music, but not necessarily for food or drink.

We got seats and waited patiently for table service.  When it didn't come, I went to the bar to get a couple of beers.  I paid with a credit card, no problem.

When I got back to the table, the waitress still hadn't visited our table and soon visited the table next to us (who got seated after us) and then she walked right past us to the table on the other side.  I tried to flag her down and was actually given some crap by one of the tables near us, like I was being a difficult or too sensitive customer.  

So we waited some more, she came and went, once, twice, three times before we finally caught her.  She took our order and, as she left, said, ""it's cash and carry, no credit cards"".  Since I had just paid with a credit card for our beers, I wasn't quite sure. She brought our 2nd beers and asked for payment.

Here is where things get weird.  The waitress (the only one) is apparently an independent contractor.  She takes the orders, then puts them into the kitchen, then she ""buys"" the food from the kitchen and sells it to us.  She then collects payment from us, cash only!

Things didn't go well, she handled it poorly, we simply didn't have cash (I rarely travel to Vancouver with cash).  I think its' pretty absurd that I was able to use my CC to buy beer but then I couldn't buy food in the same establishment.  She said ""who travels without cash!?!?""  In any event, we worked it out.

We ordered a vegetable appetizer (simple raw veggies with dip) was perfect, a nice selection of fresh vegetables.  We also ordered Fish and chips which was a single piece of Haddock (well prepared and pretty tasty) with fries.  The fries were pretty crispy, too much so for my fellow diner.  

The beer (the in-house brew) Pat's Classic Lager was a little weird. I can't say why (I am not a huge beer connoisseur) but it wasn't the best. Just saying'

I'm only giving Pats a 3 because of how I was treated by a server there last night; I don't know her name, but give her 5'3 with long brown hair. Sunday night I ordered only from her, and hadn't drank anywhere else. Like many other times, I minded my own business and was about to leave but the exit doors were locked. The doors to Hastings and the parking lot were bolt locked. I told her that I thought this was a fire code violation and she flipped out on me , opened the door to the hotel lobby, told me I was 86'd forever, that I was drunk, and she asked the hotel manager for my room number. What was all that? For my 2-3 weeks living at the Pat Hotel I very happily ate and drank downstairs many times, but for whatever reason, because I made mention that the doors were locked, this server who had been serving me went berserk. I'm leaving the hotel (which is a fine hotel, and will think well of Pats)  for elsewhere so the barring me from the bar doesn't matter that much at all, but I do think she needs a review of her customer services skills. Does she have her Serving It Right?",2021-02-15T22:29:43Z,40
1055,Pat’s Pub,3.8,"The seven years since my last review has really changed this place, and yet still I frequent it.  My surprise originates since the bar itself is nearly a hundred years old, but with recent developments in the Downtown Eastside, and a surprising amount of failing businesses and restaurants on this end of Hastings, the owners have stepped up and really accommodated the need for a good restaurant, pub, and venue. What's even more surprising is that despite some strategic pricing above the dive bar standard, they haven't really alienated the community from enjoying some drinks and food.

The kitchen menu is a simple 3 page fold out. There's about 20 items, most of which are variants of the standard pub fare. The portions are decent, the food is well plated, tastes pretty immaculate. The real winner here is accompanying house made brews, their rotating speciality tap selection, and the daily programming including free jazz and blues performances through out the week. 

I recently saw a band performing standards from Sun Ra and it was excellent of Pats Pub to host them. Expect a different crowd on weekend nights with lots of local punk and rock acts. The rockabilly crowd moved to the Fairview Pub.

1057,Pat’s Pub,3.8,"Somewhat dank and somewhat charming, Pat's Pub is the hole in the wall bar on East Hastings that stays pretty empty, but doesn't seem to mind. The bartenders are young and nice, seemingly in on the joke that their workplace is decrepit and full of elderly alcoholics who want to sit alone and drink the day away. 

In what used to be the indoor smoking area now lies a moderately professional brewery, where the bar brews it's own draft beer and serves it at dirt-cheap prices. The taste is watery and bitter, but for $12 a pitcher it could taste like piss and still be ok. There are also great deals on bottled beer for the people who don't want to risk the high lead content from the decade old pipes. 

Lots of no-name bands play on weekends, and it can get pretty fun when all of their friends show up and don't have to worry about competing for the space with the bar stars, meatheads, or hipsters that have taken a shine to other nightclubs in the area. Tuesday nights they do karaoke, and the selection is sparse but reasonable. Just watch out for the kids who made their own karaoke DVD and show up every week to sing the same songs that feature themselves in the video.",2008-12-12T08:48:25Z,40

I took a cab down to Pat's from Gastown.  It was a quick easy ride, and let me get a feel for tonight's street crowd- which seemed calm and uneventful.

Pat's looks like a little hole in the wall- but the inside is much bigger than you might expect.  There was plenty of seating at the bar and table.  The crowd was small- which conveniently meant we were able to keep the same table all night.  The waitress was around throughout the night to get us drinks.  The crowd itself was varied- a lot of new wave styles and those dedicated to the local punk scene.  The music lineup was great, but one extra exuberant singer had a hard time staying in the confines of the small stage.  The acoustics and sound system were consistent and good all night.  This area of town doesn't always have a good reputation.  However, I do recommend stopping by Pat's for some good local music.",2008-11-19T07:49:28Z,40

While that may be due to it's proximity to my house and work, I don't think I'm such a glutton for punishment that I'd keep going back if it weren't genuinely good. This place is huge, so it's great for anything from partying with a huge group, or bunkering down in a corner to study.

This is some of *the* most affordable pub food in this entire damn city, and it's actually not garbage food. It's GOOD food. A burger and fries for $8? Yes please. They have a lot of non-traditional pub food, too, such as hummus and falafel. 

As for drinks, they have a pretty good beer selection, too, and even brew their own. They mix a mighty-fine cocktail, as well! The adorable little pixie in black makes a Caesar good enough to write home about. 

As for the service, I'm usually there during the day when aforementioned pixie server is working and she's always on point and lovely.

1066,Pat’s Pub,3.8,"Pat's Pub - many a Saturday night has been spent watching bands and drinking cheap beer until it's time to head home.      I love Pat's - I love the 'grandparents basement' feel of the place - I love the regulars that are always there.     I generally head there for live bands - but have been known to stop by on a Sunday afternoon for some free pool and food.

The food is pretty decent for a pub - pulled pork sandwich is my favorite at the moment.   Drinks are dirt cheap - doubles of Sailor Jerry rum - 5.50 I believe...so it's not just cheap well liquor you can get on the cheap.   Pitchers or beer range from about 11 bucks upward.

Music - I love going here to see live bands - usually rockabilly or psychobilly bands.  The lighting is a bit meh - but that is me being picky because I like to take photographs without a flash.   The stage is about a foot high, which really lends to an up-close experience with some more boisterous bands - like the Dreadnoughts.  

My only gripe - the 1am closing time.",2009-07-09T17:14:02Z,40

I like that Pat's is never crowded (well except when there's a show) and that they're always showing games (hockey, football, soccer - whatever) on their TVs.  

The staff are friendly and helpful.

The only complaint that keeps this from being a 5 star is the lack of vegan options.  A large portion of my friend circle is vegan and they can't eat here. The veggie burger has dairy in it :(",2012-07-24T18:54:38Z,40

I love all the older people who come there and dance as well, they are so cool and sweet and just the coolest! 
The food is always as expected, just enough grotty to be bar food, but never grotty enough to make you feel ill. I've had their cod bites, chicken fingers and fries, the artichoke and spinach dip and nachos. They're all pretty good. It can be hard to flag down a waitress sometimes, and there are certain staff members who seem to get lost in the maze of that place and take longer to bus your table or deliver your food. Who knows, the place is so much fun we never really complain. Just saying if you want to go for dinner, it's a bar, so don't expect much. The music and the vibe are what make this place special. It's in an odd part of the city too, so don't be surprised if you see a whole whack of strung out crazies when you leave the place at night.",2015-10-30T06:35:14Z,40
1069,Pat’s Pub,3.8,well  this place is a dump  the people go for a good time and listen to music  the crowd seems to enjoy themselves   a wide variety of people  the chairs are most uncomfortable  a rat was running by our truck when we parked,2018-11-24T22:06:49Z,40
1070,Pat’s Pub,3.8,"One of the last remaining places of awesome in metro Vancouver.
Cheap craft home brew lager (delicious by the way), dirty punk rock bands, classic pub fair and tons of high fives.
lets keep this place alive as its the last remaining dives in town due to its location.",2012-07-12T17:57:36Z,40
1071,Pat’s Pub,3.8,"Came for a beer tasting (fab!!!) and was also wowed by the homemade shepherd's pie. I have to admit that as I crossed the parking lot to the entrance, I genuinely debated whether to just turn around and leave and pretend I never was there ... But I'm sure glad I decided to keep walking!

I had the shepherd's pie, which was house-made and delicious, came drenched in a luscious dark and savoury gravy, and perfectly complemented the darker beers in the tasting flight. The decor is pretty standard for a pub around here, and you'd never guess the neighborhood once you're inside. I highly recommend, if you can get past the surrounding area (literally!). 

P.S. it's only 2 blocks off Main St, so I'm including it on my Main Squeeze list",2012-12-13T16:56:14Z,40
1072,Pat’s Pub,3.8,I hear if you buy the door girl Adam (works weekends) a beer he will give you a massage! This is something that will keep me coming back! Ps best fries and great stop on a pub crawl.,2015-12-11T02:59:14Z,40
1073,Pat’s Pub,3.8,"If you know what you're getting into, then this place is cool. If you don't then beware. This is a classic dive bar that hosts good music a lot. The variety of patrons is VERY diverse so go witht the flow, enjoy the cheap drinks and have fun. Good to bring a lot of friends but would not recommend going alone, especially if your a female.",2009-09-11T18:08:15Z,40
1074,Pat’s Pub,3.8,"OK! Well, Pats Pub (Connected to The Patricia Hotel) begins before you get inside. Good parking right next door, and the bartender reimburses you for the ticket, that's cool. Outside Pats pub, about every 3 minutes even on a slow night you will get asked for change, a smoke, or encounter a random mentally ill person. Standard fare for East Hastings, but understand Pats is NOT in the ""worst"" part of Vancouver's skid row, normal people can visit this area without any real problem generally speaking.  That said, I wouldn't exactly ""recommend"" single alone young women come here, particularly at night.  Even guys should be ""cautious"" in this area, unless you know it real well and are super comfortable --- if this is you then you don't need this review though I suppose! I am in no way saying don't come here or to avoid. Im not even suggesting that its dangerous necessarily, I'm just saying ""have your city hat on"" and don't be stupid.
SO, Pats. Right inside there is a cool pool table where youre not in anyone's way. Then there are 3 or 4 old school video games and a pinball machine. All good and cool. Also, there was a photocopied gig poster advertising an upcoming ""rockabilly"" gig.  This is good as well. It means they have bands, and where there's rockabilly, there is likely to be punk, harder blues, and hard rock & roll. You know, all the GOOD stuff that's a blast to see live. This really begs the question as to WHY were they playing 80's top 40 satellite radio?!?!?!? Yes, everyone's punk ,rockabilly, classic rock , and heavy metal favorites including Michael Jackson, Paula Abdul, and Madonna were being blasted for everyone to enjoy (im being sarcastic)!!  Any joint that doesn't have a jukebox should be violently trashed, ESPECIALLY one that is trying to be somewhat of a live music venue ---- and a ""rockabilly"" venue at that?!?!?  Mr. Nekroman, Chuck Berry, Mike Ness etc. etc. etc. would be choked to say the least. PLUS it really says something about an owner / manager / bartender etc. who feels THEIR music choices are the best, and thusly FORCE everyone to have their ears bleed. I mean, its not like Pats doesn't have a ""general theme"". IF we went to a ""known"" dub step place, then we cant complain. But Pats, especially lately is ""generally known"" for rock and roll of some vein or another, not 80s synth garbage which was crap when it was new and still is.
ANYWAY, I head up to the bar, and this is where things go further south. Hopefully for just this particular night, but nonetheless it goes downhill.  The cheapest beer available is Pats own house ""Ale"" at $13 for a jug. This is cheap if you're from London England, but offensively and comically offensive if you happen to be from the United States or even most other provinces har har har! SO I order this jug of house draft, and the crude, abrupt, shelf-assed, no-makeup, mad because she has no boyfriend, ""bartender"" passes me the frosty well - poured jug .... And two HOT glasses. I mean these things were HOT to the touch PLUS my eyes were watering from the intense pine-sol / javex fumes. Holy crap ha ha ha!! At this time, I politely ask if I could get cold glasses, or stick these two in the ice for  a minute, or room temperature glasses at least. I don't remember her exact words , but she started huffing and puffing and stomping around looking for chilled glasses while loudly complaining about her chore she had to perform. LOL. 
My 2 friends grabbed burgers and fries, both quick, fairly tasty, and fresh (hot fries etc). So that was all good. That's the review. Neither a place to get to as soon as you can, nor a place to completely avoid. Worst part was the abrupt bartender and the AWEFUL MUSIC that made no sense for this venue.  Hey, owners!! You need to cater to a niche or PIECE of the pie and make them happy and loyal rather than trying to please everybody, ok?!?! You think the Michael Jackson people are going to like rockabilly and rock music?? No. And vice versa. These damn places need to be PREDICTABLE in what they are offering in order to create a decent customer  base, that's, heheheh, BASED on something other than the house made ""Ale"" that tastes like flat molson Canadian with dandelion flavoring added to make it appear high class and mask the low quality.  NOW, perhaps Pats rules when theres a gig. But it should also be at least a cool place on non-gig nights for the same people who go to the gig. If the only time people go is for a show, then may as well just have it at a rented community center. HAAHAH! OH YEAH, where / when is the STANDARD drink / food special for each day of the week? A $3.50 drink special is kinda standard everywhere these days.

 Last comment: Pats pub is CASH ONLY!!!! You may use their ATM for a $3.50 service fee :)

1075,Pat’s Pub,3.8,"Pleasantly surprised. It was next door to our hotel, which was cheap and located in a pretty seedy area of the city. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting much at all, but we had just ran a marathon and we weren't about to walk anywhere else. I opened the door and braced for the worst.

Wow, not what I was expecting. A huge dining area and the place was well decorated and clean. Felt right at home. They had an array of local beers on tap (my favorite) and the burgers were delicious. Service was friendly and prompt and prices were more than reasonable. Pat's definitely surprised me in a good way and I've love to go back next time I am in Vancouver.",2014-05-09T17:38:55Z,40
1076,Pat’s Pub,3.8,"Pats pub can offer that rare mix of unpretentious yet sophisticated entertainment. If you wisely decide to avail yourself of their free jazz offerings ( now on Friday evenings in addition to Saturday afternoon) you're in for possibly the best free music offering Vancouver has to offer. I personally choose the dates I attend based on what I know to be my cup of tea, so I can't speak for any given concert you might attend there but I can definitely say that on average the quality of performance is very high. I can't say I know the menu extensively as I've only ordered food once but it was fine, and others seem to like the pulled pork poutine(not my idea of a good time). Beer selection is surprisingly good as well. Anyways the main point of this review is that the food and drink is just icing on cake that is the incredible music performances. All of this in addition to the self-righteousness you'll be entitled to for supporting local music.
Do it!!!",2014-04-13T20:38:22Z,40
1077,Pat’s Pub,3.8,"Ended up here over lunch one day, when the place we were heading to wasn't opened. Thankfully, Pat's Pub was just around the corner. It's a dark and dingy-type place, but the staff are friendly (though our large order made for some bill complications). They have a $10 beer & burger special, so that's pretty sweet. I got the beef dip, which wasn't bad - better than expected. Not amazing, but not too bad. The fries were tasty. The World Cup was on lots of screens, and checked off the boxes for a fun lunch break.",2014-07-14T23:31:57Z,40
1078,Pat’s Pub,3.8,"I went here the other day with my man friend @misty b. I ordered a caesar and the pulled pork poutine. After about ten mins, I went up to ask a pretty blonde with a lovely shelf of breasts about my drink as I had never been there before and wasn't sure if that was normal or not. I Had  originally ordered from a dark haired girl with short bangs and a septum ring who then came to my table and slammed down my drink and then the same with the vinegars and ketchup, and shortly after, my poutine. It was really strange. It was almost funny how angry she was, almost. If you hate your job so much, then get another one! I worked in the service industry and you gotta leave the rage at home. I just wanted to enjoy a nice drink and dinner with my man friend without the hate infused poutine. 
The saving grace, was that the lovely blonde came over after and apologized for the drink being late. She was very kind and friendly. It really doesn't take much, Misty and I are easy. 
A side note to angry server girl: you have a ton of things to be thankful for, and you have great hair. It's important to keep in mind the position that you are in. You have the opportunity to really impact someone's day. Use your power wisely. We all get frustrated, but don't take it out on your customers. Hope you find what you need to be happy.",2015-01-06T01:43:32Z,40

1083,Pat’s Pub,3.8,"This Pub is a total surprise to me! I never would have guessed it was so great! Based mostly on it being on east Hastings st, the heart of where ya don't want to be. I had an amazing time there! A large parking lot which you need a credit card to pay for ( probably cuz the theft of the coin box was frequent) but they will reimburse you for it inside! The food was fantastic! I had the poutine which has a vegetarian gravy with the real true poutine curds of cheese from Quebec and the fries are cut on site! By far the best poutine I've had that's for sure! My friend had the burger which is all made in house not some frozen garbage like most places and the selection of craft beers on tap were fab!! I went with a tasting flight which I let our waitress choose for me. She was also amazing! Really friendly and social and great server all around. She was able to get an idea of they type of beer I might like and with a few easy questions of the usual type of beer I like and enjoy she brought back a flight that was exactly what I never knew I wanted until I tried it! Thanks Jade you were by far the best waitress I've had! The bartender was a sweet gal as well with a real rockabilly look to her and very engaging and sincere. It always impresses me how some people are able to handle them selves and others is just the right way and the staff here did exactly that! The music was great and the rest of the patrons there were regular everyday types who were out for some good food and good music and in my opinion they did it right by coming here. I will absolutely be returning to this place and recommending it to everyone I know! The only complaint I have about the place is the area, but with that brings said there's something about watching great live music in a not so great side of town that makes it that much better! Pats pub is a favourite on my list! During the week it's not as exciting however the staff is still great as is the food, the music is satellite radio but what do you expect on a Sunday or a Monday day?! I'm a repeat customer best hidden gem I've come across in this city!",2016-04-04T20:35:30Z,40

1086,The Pit,2.9,"This is part of the university life in UBC. So noisy and so crowded,but it seems that all the people here love it so much.
Normally you need to wait at least 1hour to get in.
I got a headache after that at 1.30am. On my way back to orchard I sat down at a bench cause my head ached. At that time I met one campus security. He looked very very young. He walked me home I think maybe because I looked too silly and helpless to walk by myself then.
After we talked, I know that he is a graduated student majored in law. He studied in UBC and just graduated this April. I asked whether he will be a lawyer in the future, he said ""I think so."" And I think he definitely will be a very very nice lawyer in the future. And hope I can make it to come back to UBC in the future.
2 days to go and I am gonna miss here, everything here.
Pit, see you in the future.",2019-08-10T06:47:26Z,8
1087,The Pit,2.9,"When you're on campus and your friends want to get some drinks, but you can't get into Mahone's because someone only has 1 piece of ID, this place will do in a pinch. The beer on special is usually some skunky Kokanee knock-off, and mixed drinks will take longer than you expect. There is a stage on which there is often karaoke, stand-up, or some singer-songwriter style open mic action, so if you're just looking to get a buzz on, keep that in mind.

The booths are long enough so that groups of 6+ can sit relatively comfortably, and they each have a TV mounted in the wall. (I don't know if you getr any level of control over the TVs, though.) There is a nook area with wall mounted benches and a bunch of little stools you can move around if you have a larger group. There are also a bunch of 4-tops and a couple bar-height tables for if you want to watch the stage, as well as 2 bars (although I typically only see one open).

There is a vegetarian cafe that now occupies the back section of the bar as well. I have no idea if they are also the ones who provide the Pit's food. Speaking of, the food is about what you would expect, i.e. not that great. The fries are fairly mealy, but will serve to absorb some alcohol in your stomach if that's all you need.

There are several places on (and near) campus where you can get a drink, and while this is pretty bland as bars go it's not the worst option (that dubious distinction goes to Koerner's) I'd recommend checking the available seating at the other options first.",2017-03-17T22:11:09Z,8

1089,The Pit,2.9,"Haven't been to UBC in a while and decided to give the Pit a try in the new sub. We came during a super busy lunch hour, and being strapped for time, we came in since it was nearly empty--that should've been indicative of what we got ourselves into :( Their menu has changed yet again, so I tried their daily special, which was a tomato sauce penne with pepper sausage ($9.95). The sauce was tangy tomato, not herby at all. Basically it was penne, tomato sauce, and three slices of something that resembled sausage. The penne was al dente, best of the meal. Sausage tasted old, stale, and borderline going bad. They surprisingly used fresh garlic and cilantro on their garlic bread though! It was pretty good, albeit a bit too crunchy and dry. Service was friendly but so gruellingly SLOW. We were on a tight schedule, let our waitress know, and yet... Getting our bill and takeout boxes took half an hour -.- seems like she didn't understand we needed to be back in our class at 1 meant we would like everything before 12:55 (we got there 12:15, which was cutting it close, but we ordered right away). Overall I don't know what happened to the old pit pub, because this new ""upgrade"" is a disgrace to the old name.",2016-01-12T18:28:24Z,8
1090,The Pit,2.9,"Ridiculously slow service as a result of severe understaffing, expensive prices for the quality and taste of food. It should not take 40 minutes to make a sandwich, there is absolutely no excuse. I have come back here several times when it's busy and when it's not busy to see if there's a difference in service and speed, unfortunately and rather disappointingly, there is not a difference and the essentially nonexistent service is consistently unacceptably slow. Something needs to be done about this, service is part of a pub dining experience, and should be treated as such here. I do not entirely blame the waiters and waitresses either for being slow either, restaurant management is entirely to blame here, for not understanding the needs of the customers and the lack of service and working to fix the glaring issues.",2016-03-16T20:27:04Z,8
1091,The Pit,2.9,"I came here for lunch while visiting some of my friends down at UBC before the holidays and I was not impressed. I didn't expect much being a student area, however, my sandwhich bread was over dry and the meat inside tasted more like cold cuts than actual meat. For the price point, again not impressed but it was the place to go and hang with others. My fries weren't cooked that well and my buddies was over cooked a bit that it created a hollowness inside. They do have some reasonably cheap beer on tap but that is what they have going for themselves.",2017-01-26T16:54:17Z,8
1092,The Pit,2.9,"The fries had a mealy texture; they needed more time to fully cook. Veg burger was your basic hockey puck you can buy frozen at Cutco, but for no good reason, served on a hard, thick ciabatta.
