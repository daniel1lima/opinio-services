(If I didn't encounter such awful people, I'd give the gym at least four stars.)  There's the relatively minor annoyance of people talking VERY LOUDLY on their phone or to their friend while on the exercise floor or machines; there are guys who throw basketballs at people in the gym (last week, my friend got hit in the head, very hard); there are people like in my last review who are complete assholes and have no business being out in public; and last night, some loser who was drinking a bright blue drink from a plastic cup (it looked like melted slurpee or Naked Grape Blue) and spilled it all over the ground in the atrium, right in front of the turnstiles to get into the gym.  I saw him look at the floor, see the sticky mess he had made, shrug his shoulders, and just walked off.  Ugh.  (I reported the spill to staff so that they could clean it up, and prevent someone from slipping.)  And a couple of weeks ago, I was harassed by some creep.\n\nI was on a treadmill, and four minutes into my workout, two obnoxious middle aged men went onto the empty treadmills beside me.  While they weren't being creepy, they were talking excessively loud, practically yelling, as if they were in some nightclub.  (While there is a lot of background noise at the YMCA from people using the machines and talking, it's a relatively quiet gym - which is something I like - as they don't blast music on the exercise floor, which is what other gyms seem to do.)  Not wanting to put up with their yelling for the duration of my workout, I stopped the machine at the five minute mark and started gathering my stuff to leave.  As I was gathering my things and getting off the machine, the guy right beside me started talking at me (and I also had earphones on), and asked me my name.\n\nFUCK OFF, ASSHOLE.  DO NOT TALK TO ME FOR NO REASON.  AND WHY THE HELL SHOULD I GIVE YOU MY NAME, WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO OFFER ME YOURS?  (Not that I wanted to know his name.  But demanding someone give them their name without introducing yourself is fucking RUDE.)\n\nNow, for the guys who are clueless and don't understand why this was upsetting, it's not that I have a problem with people talking to me or asking me a question, regardless of gender or age.  It's because in this situation, this guy had NO REASON to talk to me; he didn't say, \"Excuse me...\" to indicate a question, nor did he say something, such as an observation he wanted to share with me.  He right out demanded to know what MY name, a personal piece of information, was, as if I owed him an answer.  And he did so when he noticed that I was walking away.  Awww, I guess creepy guy was disappointed that he wouldn't be working out beside a hot chick.  (Which is entirely his own fault - if he hadn't been so fucking loud and obnoxious, I wouldn't have been leaving.  But since he turned out to be a creep, it was a good thing I was leaving when I was, because I would have been extra pissed off if in the middle of my workout I had to leave due to harassment.)\n\nGuys - just because you see a woman that YOU'RE attracted to doesn't mean that you are entitled to speak to her.  She is under no obligation to satisfy YOUR wants, and if you can clearly see that she doesn't want to talk to you, STFU.  While it's OK to strike up a conversation with someone, it is fucking creepy and obnoxious to start talking at a woman, who is minding her own business, simply because she is a woman, and if you don't really have anything to say.  Women know the difference between friendly chitchat and creeps hitting on them.\n\nI reported this creep to the YMCA staff, but of course the useless staff did nothing.  I wish I could go to the gym, or go to the store, or go about minding my own fucking business, without some creep harassing me.  \n\n[Yelp collections: Fitness]", "review_language": "en", "author_id": "fnkjdhvRC20zWUjB-fwMvA", "author_name": "Jasmine A.", "author_location": "Vancouver, Canada", "author_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fnkjdhvRC20zWUjB-fwMvA", "author_friend_count": 462, "author_photo_count": 8965, "author_review_count": 798, "author_elite_since_year": 2024, "author_image_url": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/yfdv_1tOOln6uyU11kCnGw/90s.jpg", "business_owner_replies": [], "previous_reviews_by_author": [{"review_id": "_5n-3mcsvcD15yTZn_SAWQ", "review_rating": 2, "review_photos": [], "review_photo_count": 0, "review_photos_link": "https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/robert-lee-ymca-vancouver?userid=fnkjdhvRC20zWUjB-fwMvA", "review_is_updated": false, "review_feedback_counts": {"useful": 8, "funny": 7, "cool": 7}, "review_reaction_counts": {"helpful": 8, "thanks": 0, "love_this": 8, "oh_no": 0}, "review_datetime_utc": "2019-03-07T06:59:44Z", "review_text": "I've been going to the YMCA for several years, and while it isn't perfect and has some issues (hence the three stars instead of four or five), it's a decent gym and overall I really like it.  In fact, I was planning on giving it an extra star, because it really is a fantastic gym, but instead, I'm going to remove one.  All the things I love about the YMCA, I still love, but the people who go to the Y are HORRIBLE.\n\nFirst of all, you must walk through the gymnasium to access certain areas of the YMCA, and if you walk through, or if you're entering or exiting the gym before/after a class, the guys playing basketball will blatantly throw the ball right at you as you're passing by -- they won't even wait five seconds for you to pass, which is DANGEROUS.  I've been hit before, and I can't count the number of times I've had near misses.\n\nI've complained NUMEROUS times, and for a while, it got better, as the staff would shoo the basketball players out just before and after classes.  But several times over the past couple of weeks, I've nearly been hit because balls were thrown directly at me.  If I, or anyone else gets injured, the YMCA is in big trouble; they have documentation of all my complaints and incidents.  They've been warned.\n\nIn addition to that general, ongoing issue, I've encountered such RUDE people at the gym.  (Gyms and public transit seem to have the rudest people.)  From a woman pounding on the bathroom door and screaming abuse at me because I took more than 30 seconds to piss, to people stealing my equipment during an exercise class, and all sorts of other BS that is too numerous to list, yesterday, I couldn't fucking believe it.\n\nYesterday, I was speaking with a staff member at the front desk about something.   Just as I was finishing up my transaction and putting my credit card and membership card in my purse, which was on the counter to my left, a woman pushed her hand right between me and my open purse, pushing my hand away, preventing me from putting my cards in my purse.  (Thankfully my cards did not fly out of my hand nor I did not fall over backwards!)  Of course I was all #$@*&^! and the \"reason\" for her PUSHING ME OUT OF THE WAY AND GETTING VERY CLOSE TO MY PURSE was because she wanted to use the card scanner, that was to the right.\n\nSo, instead of patiently waiting FIVE FUCKING SECONDS for me to finish (she could clearly see that I was finished and putting away my cards), or saying EXCUSE ME, she thought it was appropriate to PUSH ME OUT OF THE WAY, and also to reach right between me and my purse, KNOCKING MY HAND.  And it didn't even make sense, as she reached from the left side for a card scanner that was on the right; it would have made more sense to go BEHIND ME instead of THROUGH ME.  I don't know what the fuck is wrong with people, but people like that should not be allowed at the gym, or in public, for that matter.\n\nAnd yesterday after my workout, I was sitting in the atrium, at a table, talking on the phone to my husband.  Even though there were plenty of other tables and seating, this woman thought it was OK to go to MY table and place her bags on it, and rifle through them, looking for something.\n\nAnnoyed, and interrupted, I told her the table was in use and that I did not want to share it.  (As I mentioned, there were plenty of tables and seating available, including a table beside me, and she didn't ask if she could sit down, so I was fully in the right not to share!)  Her response was not to leave me alone and stop invading my personal space, but to snottily say, \"Oh, I'm not sitting down, I'm just looking for something.\"  Oh, OK.  That's totally different then! Because you're not sitting down but merely going through your purse, you're not at all in my space, making me uncomfortable, or listening to my personal conversation then!  Go and carry on, then!\n\nI had to stop my conversation and hang up so that I could tell her off, and while I was not rude, I was very firm and clear that I wanted her to leave (I stand up for myself and my boundaries) but the bitch just ignored me and spent two more minutes looking through her purse.  I just couldn't believe the rudeness of it.  What the fuck.\n\n[Yelp collections: Fitness]", "review_language": "en", "author_id": "fnkjdhvRC20zWUjB-fwMvA", "author_name": "Jasmine A.", "author_location": "Vancouver, Canada", "author_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fnkjdhvRC20zWUjB-fwMvA", "author_friend_count": 462, "author_photo_count": 8965, "author_review_count": 798, "author_elite_since_year": 2024, "author_image_url": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/yfdv_1tOOln6uyU11kCnGw/90s.jpg", "business_owner_replies": [], "previous_reviews_by_author": []}, {"review_id": "5ir50UuLDqpAqjNkpSHX2g", "review_rating": 3, "review_photos": [], "review_photo_count": 0, "review_photos_link": "https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/robert-lee-ymca-vancouver?userid=fnkjdhvRC20zWUjB-fwMvA", "review_is_updated": false, "review_feedback_counts": {"useful": 6, "funny": 3, "cool": 1}, "review_reaction_counts": {"helpful": 4, "thanks": 0, "love_this": 2, "oh_no": 0}, "review_datetime_utc": "2016-01-13T06:32:02Z", "review_text": "Here's part 2:\n\n5. Hours.  The hours are very reasonable, until 10:30pm on weekdays, and 9pm on weekends and holidays.  I don't generally workout very late, but on the occasional weekend when I have no plans, I like the option of working out until 7 or 8pm if I have things to do during the day. In the distant past I've joined some gyms, but they closed very early (like 4pm or 5pm on weekends), so I wouldn't be able to get to the gym in time before it closed.  Also, they are open on most holidays, unlike community centers which close on all stat holidays.  (Bonsor is the only community center that I've been to that is open on holidays.)\n\n6. Lockers.  There are plenty of lockers at the YMCA, and while during peek hours I might have to spend 30 seconds looking for a free locker, I have always found one.  Back in 2012 I was a member of another gym, and for many reasons I quit, one of the reasons being is that they had too few lockers.  But I've always been able to find a locker at the YMCA, and you don't have to worry about bringing a lock or remembering a combination; instead you insert your membership card into a slot in the locker, which releases a key.  (If you forget your membership card, you can borrow a temporary card.)\n\nAll in all, I love the YMCA, although it isn't perfect.  But it's pretty damn good, and after spending two years trying to find a gym to join, I realized that the YMCA was the best choice for me.  The YMCA is a solid 4 stars, however, due to the lack of no scent policy, I have to drop it down to 3 stars.\n\nI have severe scent allergies, and while I understand that no place can really regulate people wearing scents (just like our city \"regulates\" cigarette smoking), I appreciate it when there is an official no scent policy and POSTED SIGNS, so that if you are having a reaction to the inconsiderate idiot drenched in perfume who just has to choose the machine beside you, even though there are plenty of machines available, you do have a leg to stand on when you politely ask them to GTFO, in between your gasps for air.

I had intended to go back to the YMCA after my injury healed, but due to various circumstances (such as finances and my work schedule), the YMCA wasn't the right choice for me at the time.  However, I was able to find drop-in fitness classes at various community centers that worked with my budget, schedule, and needs.  So for the past two years, 2014 and 2015, I regularly went to various fitness classes at several different locations.  However, my needs and circumstances have changed so I re-joined the YMCA in December 2015, which was a great decision.\n\nHere is a list of why I love the YMCA:\n\n1. Cost.  I had been wanting to join a gym for a while, but cost was the major barrier for me. While the YMCA's regular membership rates are lower than many gyms, they also have a Access Membership price for low income people, where one can apply for a subsidized rate.  I had an Access Membership rate in 2013, and I reapplied again.  To my surprise, and gratitude, they gave me a slightly lower rate than in 2013 (cost of living has gone up, but my paycheques haven't).\n\n2. The classes.  They have a variety of classes that I like that work with my schedule.  After cost, this is probably the second most important factor for me when choosing a gym.  I like group fitness classes, so when I join a gym, I need one that has classes that I like, when I am able to get to the gym.  Classes at 8am on a Sunday morning or 4pm on a weekday don't work for me.  Weekend mornings are for sleeping, and I work Monday to Friday \"9-5\" so I need to have good classes offered after work.  The YMCA has something I like nearly every day, so it's good value for me.  \n\n3. Location.  I need a gym that is convenient for me to get to.  Unfortunately there are no gyms or fitness centers within walking distance of my home, and while there are some community centers near-ish my home, they are not convenient to get to via transit.  I have successfully made regular exercise a part of my lifestyle over the past couple of years, but since I was only doing drop-in classes, if a class was cancelled or I could not make the class, I would have to miss my workout.  So I wanted to join a gym so that I could workout solo on the machines on days when I had the time, and having a difficult commute does not encourage me to head over for a half an hour workout on a lazy Saturday afternoon.  But The YMCA, while being quite a distance away from me, is near my work so I can easily make the classes after work, and being an easy commute via the skytrain, I don't mind skytraining downtown (I use the time on the skytrain to read).\n\n4. Ambiance.  Community centers are probably the best places to go for my budget, but I've tried several community centers, and they just don't work for me.  As mentioned, location is one of the reasons why they don't work for me (there really is a dearth of community centers in my neighbourhood), and the second one is the ambiance.  I've been to a few community centers over the past several years in my search to try and find a gym that works for me, and the fitness rooms that I have seen are generally small and have few machines, and they tend to be old and dark.  (The Hillcrest Community Center was quite nice, but the sun would shine directly in my eyes--they really needed blinds for sunny days, and it was too difficult a commute via transit. Also the change room was wet and gross, and did not have individual change stalls.)  There's just something about the ambiance of community center fitness rooms that I find icky.  They are ugly, dark, and cramped, and they don't motivate me to go and workout for an hour.  However, the YMCA is quite beautiful, and is very open and bright.  I don't feel like vomiting when I step into the YMCA.  Also, unlike most (if not all) gyms, they don't blast the music at painful levels.  In fact, they don't play music in the background at all.  (I really don't understand why gyms blast music so loudly.  First, the why must it be SO goddamn loud that it is physically painful?  Can't it just be background music?  Second, people who want to listen to music while working out bring their mp3 players/phones.  When the gym's music is so loud, you can't even hear your own music unless you turn it up to dangerous levels.  So points to the YMCA for not making me feel ill when walking in, and for not causing my ears to bleed.  (However, the Zumba classes have music that is WAY too loud.)\n\n\nOh, there's more.... stay tuned for part 2, as my review is too long for Yelp's character limit.", "review_language": "en", "author_id": "fnkjdhvRC20zWUjB-fwMvA", "author_name": "Jasmine A.", "author_location": "Vancouver, Canada", "author_link": "https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fnkjdhvRC20zWUjB-fwMvA", "author_friend_count": 462, "author_photo_count": 8965, "author_review_count": 798, "author_elite_since_year": 2024, "author_image_url": "https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/yfdv_1tOOln6uyU11kCnGw/90s.jpg", "business_owner_replies": [], "previous_reviews_by_author": []}]}, {"review_id": "zgCXeLXPttgrWVcfAU_JGA", "review_rating": 1, "review_photos": [], "review_photo_count": 0, "review_photos_link": "https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/robert-lee-ymca-vancouver?userid=-WZVXzhfYR3UIVA6BtIYHA", "review_is_updated": false, "review_feedback_counts": {"useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}, "review_reaction_counts": {"helpful": 0, "thanks": 0, "love_this": 0, "oh_no": 0}, "review_datetime_utc": "2021-07-12T15:33:46Z", "review_text": "I left because it was just way too crowded.

Honestly though, I wasn't expecting much. So far I'm impressed! The facility itself is modern and huge, with 4 different levels. They've got a pool, lots of different classes to choose from, and of course tons of cardio machines etc. Its usually pretty busy, but I've never had to wait to use any of the equipment. They also provide free lockers, which is awesome as you don't have to bring your own lock. Also, the staff are so great! Really friendly and helpful.\nThe best part though? \nNo contracts!! I can't even express how much I hate other gyms and their stupid yearly contracts and fees.\nAt the YMCA you can actually join for just 1 month if you want.
