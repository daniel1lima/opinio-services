0,Gold's Gym,1.0,"The parking lot in the basement, especially this spot has no  do not back in  sign although the spot next to it has it. Don t back in on that spot. The yellow frame is not visible on the rear mirror nor the camera when you back up. That s the bad part about this gym. Gym itself is good though. But there goes my 800 dollars.",6 months ago
1,Gold's Gym,2.0,"The gym staff and equipment are good to great, however I've been a member since Jan 8th and have gone 3 times a week since then and the washrooms, sinks and showers have been out of order the entire time with no timeline of getting them fixed.  The locker rooms are barely adequate.  In one section of the men's change room people in the free weight section can see clear into the lockers/ changing area.  I've asked about the showers 3 or 4 times and nobody ever can give a clear answer.",a month ago
2,Gold's Gym,4.0,"Id like to write this review specifically for Mish, one of the staff I have had the pleasure of knowing for about a year since I started working out at Golds. Mish is not just the friendliest, but also the most attentive. I spoke to him on several occasions about issues I find with the gym and he not only listened to me with proper attention but he also guided me on ways on how can make my concerns heard. He also gave me some awesome workout tips that have helped me on my journey of self improvement! Overall, although Golds is rather subpar gym with dated, old and broken equipment, it is run by individuals the like of Mish who are friendly, sociable and great at their jobs. ",2 months ago
3,Gold's Gym,1.0,"A pretty awful gym with the worst staff - e.g., nagging you every time you workout to increase your pass duration or ""upgrade"" to a more expensive plan. Absolute scam when trying to cancel as well. Do not sign a contract with this gym, they make it impossible to cancel.",2 months ago
4,Gold's Gym,1.0,"Outdated equipment, horrible staff except for a few, no maintenance work, too busy with too many dumb annoying students wanting attention on social media for their lackluster workouts & the guys are insufferable simps that need to talk to & bother everyone for self benefit with no self awareness & a ton of half naked women giving each workout 25 percent at best & 100 percent  look at me but don t approach me vibes.  Place is a Effing joke. Do not expect to meet good people. Nice people have agendas too & they will talk to you & suck the soul out of every workout you try to do.",5 months ago
5,Gold's Gym,4.0,"I have been working out for almost 9 months with the Gold s Gym University Market Place and It has satisfied my expectations so far. There are drawbacks that if it could be addressed, I'd be happier. 1- for a reason they removed the paper towels from the men's locker room and the hand dryer is the noisiest dryer that I have ever seen. 2- More bench presses are needed. I always need to wait a long time to do a bench press.",6 months ago
6,Gold's Gym,5.0,"A great gym with good equipment and friendly staff. The main reason for the review is to flag how helpful Yash Modi was for myself and my partner. As a member of the gym's staff, he was incredibly friendly, informative and provided great advice around membership. Would recommend asking for him if you're looking for membership information.

8,Gold's Gym,3.0,"The staff are really nice and pleasant. There is a good variety of free weights and machines. The negative is waiting for weeks for a machine to get repaired. For a name like Golds, customers shouldn't have to wait weeks for repairs. Currently, the leg press, biceps curls, and bench are all down. Otherwise, its a solid gym.",10 months ago
9,Gold's Gym,4.0,Decent gym however the showers need way more attention. Floor is often slimy feeling and sometimes smell like pee,3 months ago
10,Gold's Gym,1.0,"Honestly this place doesn't even deserve one star. Here is the thing. I've heard golds gym ages ago also had an amazing tour in LA's where the staffs are also super friendly.Since i have membership with good life i didn't know the golds gym is also running business in Canada. So recently I've booked a free one day pass and really looking forward.After 1hr drive from where i live to UBC golds gym( they have four locations, UBC,west broadway. Langley and another i couldn't remember). I planned to go for a run after work out so i chose ubc one. Ok direct to the point now. I was told unfortunately I'm not allowed to work out here cuz i don't live near by within 10km or you can become the membership with us then i asked them to prove that regulation cuz i wouldn't even come if i saw this information. Then they showed me a sentence on the website says must be local resident. Please tell me how to define LOCAL. No matter which location i chose will be out of 10km. At the end i was told either pay 15 bucks or leave. Really don't wanna ruined my day so i paid. Booked a one day free pass turns out been charged. Hilarious. Besides that. All the equipments are super old. Oldies but not goodies. ",6 months ago
11,Gold's Gym,3.0,"I've been coming to this gym on and off for over a decade and although not anything amazing, the gym has improved over the years. Some trainers (like Juan) know what they're doing, others appear to be clueless. Powerlifting and Olympic lifting equipment has been added recently and is appreciated, however there is a distinct lack of cable stations. Upkeep on equipment is haphazard. Currently the leg extension machine is nearly inoperable with adjustment mechanisms needing extreme force, and padding extremely minimal by the shins. Gym has reduced hours on weekends, closing at 8pm on Saturdays and I believe 7pm on Sundays. Extremely frustrating for users. This gym is superior to others nearby like the Coop or ARC, however would not recommend it for those living nearby other locations or other gyms. ",a year ago
12,Gold's Gym,1.0,"What an experience. After years of bejng a Fitness World member, wanted to give this Gold Gym another try after I heard about the remodelling. Signed up for free pass and booked an appointment for a tour according to policy. Went to the gym to use my free pass next morning, but was offered to use the drop-in for 16.75 instead because nobody was there to do the tour. Nowhere does it say on the signup process that I can only use the free pass on the day of the tour, it only asks to book a time. That s one way to lose a member",a year ago
13,Gold's Gym,5.0,"The atmosphere of the gym is so good . But more importantly is the trainers . I have been trained with Ariana for more than 30 sessions .

14,Gold's Gym,4.0,"I like it here mainly for the opening hours, it is clean and good space. but there are some things that need improvement, especially for women training: there is no seated leg curl machine in the gym (basic equipment) and the seated leg flexion is very uncomfortable.",10 months ago

18,Gold's Gym,2.0,I rarely leave bad reviews and feel like a Karen doing this but I hope this will help further customers: It  doesn't say anywhere on their website that your have to give a cancellation notice of 30 days before actually being able to cancel. Therefor I'm going to charged 21$ bi weekly until it gets cancelled.Waste of money..You receive an email to later contact the cancellation department yourself. Unapologetic tone from staff named Dylan. Even if it's not his fault and he does not decide this method of cancellation.Perhaps putting that info on the membership experience page would make sense. ,a year ago

21,Gold's Gym,1.0,sam seemed very abrasive just because I expressed reluctance to give up all my personal info just for a 90 second tour of the gym.

41,Robert Lee YMCA,5.0,"I joined the Robert Lee YMCA a couple months ago for the pool, and I just love the place. The environment is great and the pool is kept clean and organized. Above all, the lifeguard staff are what make the place so special. They're all well-trained, supportive and friendly. I've never had such a good time getting in shape. Whatever they're getting paid, it's not enough. Many thanks to the lifeguards!",11 months ago

43,Robert Lee YMCA,1.0,"The gym itself and facilities are nice  when you can actually use them. They have completely oversold memberships for this gym, and not just in January. It s constantly busy at all times and it s like a jungle during peak times. Six men at one squatting rack - ridiculous and unsafe. There is no floor supervisor / supervision, people set up in the middle of the floor, in front of the racks, anywhere to get in a workout, it s sad and unsafe. They let kids 11-13 year olds run wild in the cool down/ stretch Astro room they jump around off the different exercise balls and equipment. I do not recommend this gym to anyone who is serious about working out.",a month ago

45,Robert Lee YMCA,5.0,"My recent visit to the YMCA on Burrard Street turned out to be an exhilarating journey into the world of powerlifting. Stepping into the weight room, I was immediately struck by the atmosphere of determination and focus. With a variety of equipment available, I was eager to put my strength to the test. Starting with the barbells, I loaded up plates and began my deadlift session. The smoothness of the bars and the well-maintained equipment allowed me to concentrate fully on my form and technique. As I lifted heavier weights, I could feel myself pushing past my limits, thanks in part to the supportive environment created by fellow gym-goers and staff. Moving on to the squat rack, I found myself immersed in the challenge of conquering increasingly heavier loads. The adjustable safety bars provided peace of mind as I pushed myself to new heights, both physically and mentally. The thrill of completing each set filled me with a sense of accomplishment, driving me to push even further. Finally, I tackled the bench press, where I focused on refining my technique and building strength. The availability of various bench setups catered to my needs, ensuring a comfortable and effective workout. With each rep, I could feel myself getting stronger, inching closer to my fitness goals. Overall, my experience at the YMCA on Burrard Street was nothing short of exceptional. The well-equipped facilities, supportive atmosphere, and dedicated staff made for an unforgettable workout session. Whether you're a seasoned powerlifter or just starting out on your fitness journey, this YMCA is the perfect place to unleash your inner strength and achieve your fitness goals. ",a month ago

48,Robert Lee YMCA,1.0,"Original: Immaculate facility & superb staff! A fellow in maintenance named Robert is especially friendly & makes the experience that much more inviting. 10/10 would recommend. Edit: 3+ years after I started going, I had taken a 2 year break from the city in that time & I'm back now and noticing things like some showers that were broken, are STILL not fixed, the steam sauna has been shut down for the WHOLE YEAR & many other issues have arose since the pandemic like poor reception help. I hope they try to fix these issues. EDIT AGAIN: The steam saunas have been shut down for 18+ months now - and it seems like no urgency to have the repairs worked on. There is no reduction in cost either, and many of us go here just to steam after a workout. This is absolutely ridiculous...   I once even tried to apply to work here and help improve things, and they don't take applications, it's only online on their general website - no chance to even speak with anyone running the joint to share some ideas. It needs new management - that is very clear. Edit again again: I called in today (Nov 1), well precisely I called 4 times because no one picked up to put me on hold, but a very kind sounding spanish dude picked up and told me how they finally started demolition in October and it will be open again in February. Although having knowledge about construction, esp. in Vancouver - I can't imagine they'll be finished until April or May. But it's good news to hear that demolition started recently. Edit again again again: (Jan 24 2024) I called in today to inquire about the sauna updates - as I had been hoping to be coming back to this gym soon. I was told today that there have been ADDITIONAL setbacks and it won't be open until the spring time now. What. The. Actual. Fudge ",a month ago
49,Robert Lee YMCA,5.0,"Got the family membership, reasonable price considering all you get. Gym, classes, badminton, squash, Basketball, swimming pool.

52,Robert Lee YMCA,5.0,"I just joined this gym. Its actually super nice. Plenty of space, lots of machines. Great price given the space and amenities. Lockers also come with a key so u don't have to bring one. Quite a bit of weight sets so you don't have to wait on sets to be available.",a year ago
53,Robert Lee YMCA,4.0,"I love this gym! For $28 dollars a month it is so accessible to so many in Vancouver.     the facilities are pretty good! It s lovely that spin classes are offered here, yoga classes and volleyball. My suggestions would be: the dance classes take up the large gymnasium and have very few people who attend, and the yoga classes are always FULLY booked  can those swap locations so more people can attend yoga? Also, there are so many gym times for basketball and 1 volleyball session a week that isn t at 6am  would it be possible to create more time for volleyball because every Friday it is packed and you hardly get any playing time in! Thanks :)",a year ago
54,Robert Lee YMCA,4.0,"Clean, well organized setup. Good free classes. Friendly staff. Nice pool and other facilities. Only con is that the swipe cards have no user-specific identification on them so if you lose your card and it gets returned, the card (probably) gets recycled and the you have to pay $5 for a new card.

55,Robert Lee YMCA,4.0,"Good gym but hardly anyone at the gym desk to help out. Seems understaffed, especially at peak hours. My review will change when they decide to actually have adequate staff during busy periods. Edit: seems like some more people are on the floor currently. ",11 months ago

57,Robert Lee YMCA,2.0,"This place has become a maintenance disaster. Members are locked out of their own lockers (sometimes left naked until the fire department is called), the men s steam room has been closed 9 of the last 12 months, hot tubs are in and out of commission, water dispensers broken  it certainly makes one wonder about the safety of the gym equipment. For the price they re charging, members deserve better.",a year ago
58,Robert Lee YMCA,3.0,"The shower room is big and clean.  Excellent location in downtown. For the pool, the width for medium and fast lane is too small that it is basically not possible to have more than one person to swim there, it is easy to hit the others who swim from the opposite direction.  Quite a lot of swimming classes there which would take up the lanes.  Counter staff looks tired, no smiling...will not recommend it if you are looking for swimming. ",a year ago
59,Robert Lee YMCA,3.0,They need to start emailing Plus members when the hot tub is closed. Some of us travel long distances to this location and I wouldn t if I knew none of the amenities are available. Of course the steam room has been closed an insanely long time and no financial concessions have been made to members despite not getting what we paid for.,11 months ago
60,Robert Lee YMCA,5.0,"I love the Y. Lots of great classes, excellent personal trainers, and modern equipment. The pool is fabulous and the locker rooms are always clean. 5 stars, 2 thumbs up,  and no hesitation about recommending this place to all ages and genders.",a year ago
61,Robert Lee YMCA,5.0,"I always go swimming every Monday morning and both the lifeguards are always super nice to me. Everyone always has a smile on their face and it's a super welcoming environment. Last week, I even saw the lifeguards giving some swimming tips to a member.

63,Robert Lee YMCA,1.0,"Beware of this organization's membership cancellation money scam. Members wishing to cancel their membership, subsequent to placing it on hold in response to the suspension of available facility services, who are unable to resume visitation as a result of services still being unavailable 16 weeks later, will have to make 2 payments before their membership is canceled. One at the end of the hold period, and another 14 days later (1 day before the 15-day hold cancellation requirement is met). For Men's Plus members that amounts to over $100 for nothing.",a year ago
64,Robert Lee YMCA,1.0,"Nice variety of equipment that is well maintained.  Staff is also very friendly and helpful.  I really enjoy my workout here and love the variety of cardio equipment. But... thing is now that covid is over, its turning back into a zoo gym. Getting busier and busier all day, every day - morning, noon, early afternoon, evening, no matter which time you go, there's no avoiding the crowds.  Usually have to wait a while for equipment most times which is a bummer.   It's too bad as I live near this place and it's really convenient. Also, good luck getting into any yoga classes.  They release the time slots at midnight every night and get taken up within seconds. Even the waiting list gets taken up.  For those that aren't up that late, it's a little unfair. Ultimately, I might look into a different gym if it gets busier than it is. Update: After giving this gym a fair chance and trying different hours (morning, late morning and mid day) you can never win with the crowds here.   It's gotten so bad that you'll be lucky to be able to complete a full workout due to all the floor space, machines and racks being used up (with a line to get on each area).  Even if your patient and wait your turn for a machine, people will hound you during your set making you feel rushed.    Sure, its got good equipment but what's the point in having great equipment if you can never use it! The YMCA charges way too much for being a zoo gym and can't justify the cost.  Will never understand how people give places like these good reviews.  They really seem love paying high prices for waiting in lines in overcrowded places. ",10 months ago
65,Robert Lee YMCA,5.0,"Great cheap place for workouts with a nice pool as well! 5 squat racks, 2 flat benches, a good amount of machines, and some dumbbells going up to 100lbs! Also has a pretty good cafe that has cheap protein snacks. ",a year ago
66,Robert Lee YMCA,5.0,Amazing gym and very clean building. One huge request from management though. Please open at least one squash court. Not many places in the city have a squash court and its barely used by others for working out. Would be amazing if we can use it again like in 2019. Thank you :) ,11 months ago
67,Robert Lee YMCA,3.0,"There's good and bad. I'll start with the bad. It's a gym that seems to have everything but not everything is working or is being used for what it's designed for. For instance, it's probably the only fitness gym downtown with a full-sized basketball court, but instead of it being used to play basketball it has an artificial wall in place that separates one half of the court from the other so those who do want to play basketball are cramped together using 3 baskets with minimal space. But interestingly that wall is removed when the gym gets used for badminton and/or vollyeball. Also none of the steam rooms are operational right now and haven't been for some time. The good. Has a lot of cardio machines, plenty of free weights and weight machines, yoga rooms for stretching, and even rooms for crossfit style exercise. They have a lot of classes available if that's your thing and a very nice, large swimming pool with a lengthy hot tub nearby. There's parking underneath for about $3.00 per 1.5 hours if you need to drive and a nice cafe with quick bites, coffee, and a variety of soft beverages for sale in the main lobby. They have what's known as a plus membership which basically just allows you access to a more exclusive locker room that currently has a non-functional sauna, an exclusive hot tub, nicer lockers, and towel service (although these aren't face towels for working out, just large towels for drying after a shower). Not quite worth the $50 plus every couple weeks in my opinion so I just go with the standard. ",a year ago
68,Robert Lee YMCA,1.0,"This place is the elitist community center. They discriminate against people for not having a credit card. You shouldn't need a cc to be able to utilize a YMCA monthly pass in any TIER, especially the plus memberships. Those are the kind of things that make a difference to people who NEED IT. They also never paid me back for my lost time from covid. After they closed they said they would. When I came back I wasn't even in the system anymore. ROBERT LEE should be embarrassed to see how inefficiently this building is at helping the people who need it below middle class. I hope they wake up and start treating everyone equally.",9 months ago
69,Robert Lee YMCA,3.0,"Hours are too limited. It closes too early, especially on weekends. Pool hours are very limited.

93,Robert Lee YMCA,1.0,I learned about a very unhealthy dominant-submissive game that some kids forced mines to play in preschool. unfortunately yesterday I learnt that my daughter was bullied with a younger sibling of a girl that invented that game every single day. My son mentioned one day that older sister once forced him to crawl and follow her. Then she asked another girl to play the same game with my daughter and made her kitty too. The sad and shocking part is the head-instructor admitted that she was aware of all that happened there and she did not share with that tow siblings were bullying my more than a year in Coat Capital Savings preschool. She told me she had asked from my 4 years old daughter if she was ok with that game and she nodded. ,a year ago

114,Equinox W Georgia St,5.0,"I am obsessed with this place. I go seven days a week. It is my second home. Customer service goes the extra mile, instructors are amazing, the process of booking for a class spot seamless through its app (if you really want to get in, just set your alarm so you can book your spot once booking opens up. Simple!) Plus, unlike other clubs/studios, equinox do not charge for last minute cancellations or no show like other clubs/studios. It hones the discipline of showing up by reinforcing ""strikes"" should you fail to cancel booking within a reasonable time. The lounge, steam room, sauna, showers, locker room, always clean and with an attendant present should you need assistance. And, for times when you need a space for your workout (yoga, barre, weights), there is definitely a space that you can use. All in all, I would say, that Equinox stays true to its claim: It's not fitness. It's a lifestyle.",5 months ago
115,Equinox W Georgia St,4.0,"I'm really happy with my experience at Equinox gym in Vancouver. The facility offers excellent equipment, and I appreciate the availability of towels, clean showers, and a sauna/steam room. The variety of classes is a great break from my usual weightlifting routine on the weights floor, and I particularly enjoy the boxing classes. The only downside is that it can get quite busy during rush hour between 4-7pm, so I try to schedule my visits outside of that time frame (-1 star). Overall, I highly recommend the Vancouver Equinox gym.",9 months ago
116,Equinox W Georgia St,5.0,great gym. Vancouver's Best Gym. So many free awesome classes to change up your fitness routine. So many ways to feel motivated. And there is a steam bath plus sauna plus shower plus Kiehls products and free towel service. This place is worth the investment in your health and wellness,a month ago
117,Equinox W Georgia St,5.0,"I have been spending a lot of time in Vancouver lately so wanted to join the BEST club & I really feel it is. Here are the many reasons why. 1) The front desk staff are so friendly and take the time to say hi and use your name! So important in a city that is often not very friendly. 2) The manager Liz took the time to make a phone call to straighten out a booking glitch - that is what customer service used to be & this is so amazing, refreshing and appreciated. 3) The classes are plentiful, outstanding & with kind and extremely talented instructors. 4) The place is the cleanest gym I have ever seen w/ lovely extras throughout. 5) I love that all the class rooms are pre-set up with the mats and towels before you enter and that they take a roll call. I thought it was strange at first, but it really keeps the classes to the capacity intended and makes you accountable to show up. I had read some of reviews before I joined and thought it would be impossible to get into the morning classes that I prefer, but that has not been the case. You have to wake up to book 26 hours before your class and if you are late scheduling yourself it may fill up. However, if you are motivated - you can get in. Certain classes, such as Barr classes tend to fill up, but I heard they may be adding in more soon anyway. Since great companies always strive to improve, I could add that I personally would appreciate more visual instruction to accompany the verbal instructions during classes and maybe some more correcting (teachers walking through the class helping to correct/improve students poses). I have seen it, but rare. I do know that it is hard to please everyone as some people may not want that. My only complaint is that there is not a club in Ottawa! ",5 months ago

124,Equinox W Georgia St,1.0,"A few months ago I made decision to cancel my membership at Equinox Gym, and I must say that my overall experience has been quite disappointing. As someone who used to spend a significant amount of money on personal training and regarded the facility highly, I am disheartened by the decline in service and quality. One of the main issues I encountered during my time as a member was the lack of available space for my workouts. It was frustrating to consistently find no room to exercise, and the absence of free showers only added to my dissatisfaction. These are basic amenities that should be easily accessible to paying members. When I initially requested a cancellation, the front desk staff seemed overwhelmed and busy. They hastily wrote down my name to cancel, but unfortunately, I failed to follow up on the process, which I admit was my mistake. Months later, I was shocked to receive threats of collections if I didn't pay the outstanding balance. To make matters worse, when I discussed the issue with a staff member, they called me a liar and denied any system downtime, despite the fact that they were clearly experiencing technical difficulties at the time. Furthermore, I was never able to take advantage of the so-called ""free classes"" that were included in my membership. These classes were consistently booked up almost instantly, leaving me unable to participate throughout my three years as a member -- this is an issue for most members. This overcrowding issue, combined with the unhelpful and unsympathetic attitude of the staff, has greatly diminished my overall satisfaction with the facility. All in all, I can confidently say that Equinox Gym is not worth the exorbitant cost. The overcrowded environment, unhelpful staff, and unavailability of promised amenities make it far from the facility that was showcased during my initial tour. I regretfully cannot recommend Equinox Gym based on my personal experience, and I hope that the management takes these concerns into account to improve their services for current and future members.

125,Equinox W Georgia St,5.0,"I ve only joined for a month for the purpose of joining group classes but so far it s been great. The facility is clean, and the classes are varied.

127,Equinox W Georgia St,5.0,"I've been a member of Equinox for some time now, and I can confidently say that this gym center exceeds all my expectations. Equinox has truly set the gold standard for what a gym should be. Relaxation Quality : Equinox offers a serene and calming atmosphere that allows me to unwind and destress after a long day. The relaxation quality is exceptional, with a peaceful ambiance that helps me find my zen. Group Classes : The variety and quality of group classes are top-notch. Whether it's yoga, spinning, or HIIT, the instructors are knowledgeable and motivating. It's a fantastic way to stay motivated and connect with fellow members. Steam and Dry Sauna : The availability of steam rooms and dry saunas is a real highlight. They provide the perfect post-workout relaxation, and I appreciate the attention to cleanliness and hygiene in these areas. Cleanliness : Cleanliness is a priority at Equinox. The gym is impeccably maintained, and I've always found the facilities to be spotless. This commitment to hygiene is especially important in today's environment. Everything is Fine : From the well-maintained equipment to the friendly and helpful staff, everything about Equinox is top-notch. The attention to detail and member satisfaction is evident in every aspect of the gym. Equinox has become more than just a gym for me; it's a place of relaxation, fitness, and overall well-being.

131,Equinox W Georgia St,5.0,"Not sure where to start with how great Equinox is. This is without a doubt the best fitness facility in BC. For your very reasonable monthly fee you are able to sign up for as many free classes as you want (Hot yoga, boxing, running, metcon etc), they have chilled eucalyptus towels, Keihls products in the showers, eucalyptus steam and sauna, and the best fitness equipment available. I think the best perk of all has to be the motivators - my favourite is Lu! They check in regularly to help keep you motivated and on track. This might be one of the biggest reasons i've been consistent with my workouts. When you consider most other fitness classes cost upwards of $35 per class, the cost of membership is remarkably low for all the value Equinox provides. 10/10 - Ask for Lu! ",a year ago

143,Equinox W Georgia St,5.0,"The unlimited classes are awesome and the diverse array of classes (yoga, pilates, barre, conditioning, cycling, boxing...) make it much more worthwhile then getting a membership elsewhere. If you intend to take classes several times a week the membership cost is totally worth it. Cara Lee has the best barre class and Todd Randall has the best yoga classes. The facilities are clean and appealing making a trip to the gym feel like a trip to the spa. The showers are stocked with high quality hair and body products. They have these cold eucalyptus towels that are awesome, putting one on my face while in a steamy shower is the best feeling ever. However, If you just intend to lift weights, you could have the same quality workouts elsewhere for a better price. Feedback: It would be awesome to have face/body lotions in the showers rather than in a communal area for privacy and convenience. I would love if they put on calming or spa-like music in the shower area. More types of services at the spa would be awesome (facials). ",9 months ago

Customer service so far has been really good. Elis showed me around and handled my sign up and was very helpful and informative. Gave me a 1 day trial which I enjoyed. Branislav is awesome, he is the personal trainer that did my complimentary fitness assessment. I have yet to try the Pilates assessment. I went to a yoga class which was ok, and a core class that I really enjoyed. I am still getting to know the classes and seeing what works for me. The price is quite pricey so if it is only for weightlifting I do not recommend, however if you are gonna also enjoy the classes I think it is reasonable.

They curate and optimize all the workouts to be really enjoyable on top of being effective. I found the overall atmosphere and instructors to be motivating. There is an app which makes it easy to book classes. There are nice luxe touches like the refrigerated eucalyptus scented towels for when you are working out. Staff are very attentive and will hand you towels or ask if you need anything while you re just on the treadmill. Only negative is the classes which are required to be booked are way too full most of the time, to the point where you have a high chance of being kicked or kneed in the face during workouts or doing that to some other poor soul just trying to get their workout in. This was highly unpleasant and I would try at all costs to avoid the popular class times but sometimes would not be able to. People who were not signed up often slipped into these classes, so having a booking system to manage the number for popular class times doesn t make any difference if this is not enforced.

166,Equinox W Georgia St,5.0,"I was unsure about Equinox because of their  beautiful people  marketing. However, the number and quality of their classes meant I contacted the club and met Elis Llanos, one of the Membership Advisors. She is excellent, very personable and understood my situation very well. The Club does not have a pool, but the quality of the amenities is really excellent. I appreciate the towels (including the chilled ones infused with eucalyptus!!); toiletries and lockers. I just need to turn up with gym kit, which is great! I have had one class and it was well run and effective. All the staff are pleasant and enthusiastic. Only draw back is it is hard to book a class on some of the popular class times. Glad I joined! ",a year ago
167,Equinox W Georgia St,1.0,"If you plan on coming to the gym Monday - Friday between 4pm-8pm DO NOT SIGN UP!! It is ridiculously busy. You ll wait in line for lockers, every piece of equipment, floor space and showers. Very frustrating when you re paying over $200/month. When this concern was brought to management a few months ago, their solution was adding more classes during this peak time  now the locker rooms are even worse during this time. No space when changing, line for showers, every hair dryer being used.. Which good luck even getting into the extra classes they ve created. If you aren t on exactly 26 hours before, you ll have a waitlist of over 10+ people. The cherry on top is there s always 2-3 people in the offices signing up for memberships and management tells them  it s not usually this busy . That s a lie. Yes it is. Will not be renewing my membership and would not recommend this gym to anyone until they deal with the capacity.",a year ago

176,Equinox W Georgia St,2.0,"I was an Equinox member for three years and for the most part wit was great. The facilities were clean and staff were super friendly. Unfortunately, it s become way over crowded this year. There were a few occasions where people were standing in the steam room and lining up just to shower. Pretty ridiculous for a $200+/month gym. When I asked if I could pause my membership until the gym dies down a bit they wanted to charge me $50 per month just to pause my membership. Needless to say I ve cancelled my membership and regret sticking with them throughout COVID. ",a year ago
177,Equinox W Georgia St,2.0,"Unfortunately the biggest problem with Equinox is how crowded it's become. No matter how clean and nice the gym is, none of that matters when the weight area is comically busy. Don't even think about working out between 4-8 on weekdays. The classes are nice but there are way too many people per session and you barely have any space to complete the exercises. So what are your options? You pay $230 a month to be able to workout 10 am - 2 pm or 8 pm - 10 pm. I will be canceling my membership once the one year contract ends.",a year ago
178,Equinox W Georgia St,1.0,"Update: NO space during weekday 5-7pm. Monday is the worse don t have any space to work out. I Stopped going on Monday. Could not find empty locker at a glance, had to wait someone to leave. Some Classes are filled in A less than a MUNITE !! Worst situation continues.. they've signed up way too much for the SMALL gym space. It is overly crowded. You won't be able to do a workout you want if you go around 5-7pm, even hard to pass beside people, this small space is just fully fully packed. cleaning is not catching up, lack of towels and washroom was gross. Also, the classes get full so quickly with a long waiting list. Didn't expect this busy . I don't think it's worth for what you are paying for. At least they should explain this ridiculously crowded situation to the people before sign up to be fair( of course they don't .. I wish I knew this.. I should have read more negative reviews before sign in) I can not believe they are still trying to get more people sign in. If your schedule is flexible and can visit daytime avoid rush hour it is a good gym, maybe. otherwise welcome to the zoo.

So far, I've taken pilates, barre, and yoga classes and I can already feel a positive impact on my body. I enjoy all of the amenities, especially the steam room. Staff is very helpful and go above and beyond. Thank you Equinox team!",a year ago
183,Equinox W Georgia St,5.0,"The community at this gym is incredibly strong. That s important in such a city which often feels like communal relations are weaker than a lot of other places in this country. Aside from the amenities and classes which can be found at other locations in Canada, the people at this location are worth it. The gym can sometimes get busy but most of the time it is not overcrowded. I rent a locker and pay for laundry service, so I don t have to worry about locker space. They re generally pretty good about getting your clothes cleaned and returned to your locker within 24 hours. I go nearly every day and the staff are always amazing. They basically all know my name (even if I don t know theirs) and will get stuff done. I ve never been told that something is not possible, they always find a solution. Geoff, who manages all the classes is the most productive person I have met. He knows so many people s names and his classes are always perfectly challenging and achievable. I am especially happy that Maddy Kenwood is my membership coordinator! She is one of the most pleasant and welcoming people that I have met who brightens the day of everyone she interacts with. There are also a bunch of charismatic, professional and learned teachers. The standout trainers are: Zachary Fiordio extremely charismatic and motivating. Christie Baumgartner who always challenges you with new yoga flows. Chelsea Wissink the funniest, and most personable one of them all. Davi Teixeira Who gives the best, most detailed instruction. As well as Krystina Kodesh & Todd Randall. Todd is the best movement teacher I have had. He teaches Vinyasa and Power Yoga a couple times a week. His flows vary from class to class, but it feels like his foundation is consistent and challenging. My body has never consistently felt so good than how it feels after each class that he teaches. He suggests micro-movements to ameliorate your stance and posture which make my stances and flows more powerful and safer every time. Each class I gain strength while my body feels relaxed and restored. I d recommend joining if you re interested in the classes or in the strong community! ",11 months ago
184,Equinox W Georgia St,2.0,I am a member here after moving from San Francisco and I have to say it s pretty disappointing. I ve been to 10+ Equinox around North America and this is by far the worst one. While the facility is nice and clean the biggest issue is it s insanely overcrowded (one of the trainers told me it s the 3rd busiest in NA). I was also told that they just plan to keep adding new members without capping it. I go at 6 am and you are still waiting around for equipment. They also only have 3 squat racks and two platforms for an overcrowded gym. If you like cardio it s fine because half the gym is cardio machines so those are typically available. Realistically they need to double the weight section for the amount of members and have 6-10 platforms for it to feel comfortable. For $200+ monthly you shouldn t have to be standing around waiting for equipment or getting asked constantly how many sets you have left at 6 am (or any time). I d pay an extra $100 per month for half the people. Completely takes away from the  luxury  feel ,a year ago

Highly recommend his classes!!",a year ago
187,Equinox W Georgia St,5.0,"Five stars for the five best features of the best gym I've been to: (1) Staff, especially the trainers.  If only I had this kind of coaching when I started working out.  (2) Maintenance.  Amenities are only great if they're kept clean and in good condition.  These are. (Hey, scented towels!)  (3) People watching.  The lobby is one of the best-designed interior spaces in the city, along with the Energie bar, that makes hanging out and checking out the clientele (one of the most diverse in a diverse city) a pleasure.  Equinox may have a rep for stand-offishness, but not my experience.  Think of the sauna as a conversation pit.   (4)  Progamming.  More options than I know what to do with.   (5) Sound design.  What can make the overall environment annoying if too loud or the music inappropriate can also be motivating,  Not an easy balance to find, and most of the time it is. Okay, the down side: (1)  Yup, it's expensive - the business class of gyms.  For me, it's been worth it.   (2) Too small  - a boutique gym.  Okay if it's not too crowded, but often it is.  (3) Locker room  - an exception to the high quality of design.  Too tight, with an awful locking system that makes it easy to forget where your locker is and what the combo was.  (4) Limited equipment, especially dumbbells.  Need more of 'em with 'in-between' weights, like 12.5.   (5) More passes for guests and to Equinoxes in other cities.  Too few over a year. Most of the negatives are a consequence of its popularity and size.  But the quality of the staff (hey Maddy, Aivan, Nico and y'all at the front desk!) offset that for me. ",a year ago

201,Equinox W Georgia St,4.0,"I ve been a member since they ve opened in 2016.  In terms of atmosphere, amenities and equipment as well as variety of classes, nothing in the city equals Equinox. However, it seems Equinox is still hungry for membership and the already crowded space will get even more congested.  I ve since switched my workouts to the morning as the evening is an absolute zoo.  With that in mind, I ll be keeping a lookout for any upmarket gyms.  Don t think there are any that has the same clout as Equinox, so maybe private club membership may be the next route. ",a year ago
202,Equinox W Georgia St,3.0,"Too busy for the $$$$ Equinox is by far one of the nicer gyms in Vancouver. They have a wide variety of classes and superior equipment and amenities. I've been a member both in Vancouver and the states, and I can stay overall, my experience this time around has been disappointing. The Vancouver location is so busy that it makes it nearly impossible to use the equipment without significantly altering your workout or wasting time waiting. Most of the classes are great, but if you want to get into a specific class, you better set a timer for the booking window otherwise, you won't get in. There were rumours of a second location in Vancouver prior to COVID, something that I think would fix a lot of their problems, but it seems EQX is more concerned with maximizing income than keeping a sustainable membership load. My advice to EQX, fix the overcrowding problem. ",a year ago
203,Equinox W Georgia St,5.0,"It's been 7 months that I'm going there and almost ""Every day"" so my experience is based on this. Amenities, cleaning, quality of service (in all aspects ) and staff (from the concierge, finance, sales, etc.) are 5/5 in Vancouver. Membership is worth it, in exchange for the amazing package you receive. The sales team is amazing! Elis is the best! You never feel they are pushing u to buy any extra service! Jeff is the head of the instructor team. He is the most supportive one who is taking care of all your concerns and questions about classes. Best Instructors in my opinion ; Cycling; Monique Blythe Athletic classes; Shai Zakaria, Luke skyes Barre; Carolyn Cheung Pilates; Chelsea Wissink Yoga; Yadu Baznath , Christie B After all, this, finish your experience with relaxing steam or sauna and shower! Enjoy it! Plz attention, a 5/5 score for my experience with Equinox is based on other gyms' service levels and quality vs. the membership you pay, in Vancouver city. I mean it's not compared with luxury gyms in other countries like US or Dubai. ",a year ago

210,Equinox W Georgia St,1.0,"Totally overrated and overpriced.. Read this comprehensive review in full and Be Warned!! The gym space is too tiny. It is usually overcrowded, without enough machines/equipment or space for the crowd. It is literally a ZOO in early mornings and evenings.. Except for cardio machines and some benches and weights, they have only 1 of each type of machine with extremely limited variety, which is crazy..  Every other gym has multiple machines of each type with much greater variety. The gym is already at full capacity and there are literally line ups for machines at peak hours, yet they keep recruiting new members.. The quality of machines and equipment is just mediocre as well; no premium brand or quality. Music is too lame and almost non-existent. Gym working hours is quite short, particularly in the weekends. It's open only 8am till 7pm on weekends, and on stat holidays it closes at 4pm. Apparently they recently close the gym at 4pm on Saturdays and Sundays as well, on long weekends! (Just as an example, Gold's gym is open 7am till 10pm every weekend.) Group classes are also much more limited on weekends and Fridays. Personal trainers are just mediocre; nothing special about their performance, skillset or their commitment to make a differnece for their clients. Most of them just want to get over with the hour and move on, and of course very pushy to book more sessions with them. Group classes are similarly tooo crowded. You cannot attend any class you wish; you have to make prior online booking which becomes available only 24 hours before each class. Good classes are very difficult to get a spot in (and I'm not even talking about limited capacity in Covid times..).  Early mornings, evenings, and lunch time classes fill up super quickly. Class instructors are similarly just mediocre; most of them do not spend any time/energy to correct the students and teach them the right way of doing the exercises. (In all fairness, there are some better instructors and PTs who actually care to some extent - especially the ones who are outsourced - but majority of them are just mediocre.) In general there is an underlying unpleasant culture within the organization. Some managers have condescending snobby attitude; they and some other staff literally act as if the members work for them..!! Similarly, too much attitude and plenty of eye-rolling from some girls at the front desk and other staff, plus unnecessary bossiness from some dudes on the gym floor. Some of the staff are just way too rude...   Apparently at this place you pay more to be treated with less respect.. 'The luxury' marketed by the brand, in this location is meant for the staff apparently - not the members.. Obviously the gym doesn't have a pool - nor hot tub. But they charge  premium fees (and constantly increase it too) as they charge at other Equinox locations with pool and other amenities. There are just tiny sauna rooms which are similarly overcrowded. In early mornings, the locker room is an absolute zoo and there are line ups for showers.. At a whopping $230 per month + $400 initiation fee, you are paying more than $8.5 (plus Tax!) per day. Go 2 days per week and you pay more than $30 (+ tax!) per visit, for an overcrowded totally mediocre gym, with very limited equipment and hours. It is basically just a marketing scam.. There is nothing really premium about this Equinox facility; yet they charge super premium fees. Don't get tricked by their super pushy fakely-nice staff while giving you a tour around. You can get much better service at literally any other gym, for a fraction of what Equinox charges here. Oh and of course they will make you lock in for at least 1 year (no trial/monthly membership options). Cuz most of people would just leave after the first month if they had the option to..  They have super strict rules which make it almost impossible to terminate your membership before your 1 year contract; you almost literally need to die to get your membership cancelled! ",a year ago

219,Equinox W Georgia St,1.0,"The gym chose to close at 4pm for the full labour day weekend (Saturday/Sunday/Monday) which is a bit ridiculous considering how much the membership costs  but maybe it s a labour shortage. However, what Liz Jacobs and her team failed to do was notify the members appropriately. Both Google Maps and the Equinox App only informed of an early closure for Monday, but not the Saturday or Sunday. Also, the email notifying of the hours change only stated to check the app (which, again, did not correctly state the changed hours). How wonderfully convenient /s. Here s a tip: Respect your members  time. I sat through 30 minutes of downtown traffic one-way only to realize of the early closure due to a sign on the door. Let us know by email, and correctly state holiday hours on the app and google maps. This is not rocket science. All the eucalyptus towels in the world do not supercede good customer service. I ll consider eventually deleting this review if I receive a public reply from management explicitly promising they won t waste all our time like this again. ",a year ago

228,Equinox W Georgia St,5.0,The perfect set up if you want to do a variety of classes & still have gym access. Also Elis was so lovely & made sure we were taken care of from the moment we stepped in the gym.,a year ago
229,Equinox W Georgia St,5.0,Lorcan is the best trainer I ve ever worked with! This location also has amazing amenities & atmosphere (more upscale than most other Equinox locations).,10 months ago
230,Equinox W Georgia St,2.0,"Not worth the money... For a whopping $230 / month, plus $400+ initiation fee, I was expecting to be blown out of the water, but was remarkably underwhelmed. As a member for over a year I feel well placed to share some insights based on months of almost daily experience: PROS 1. The club is gorgeous! 2. They have fairly modern equipment 3. Lots of fitness classes to choose from 4. Towel service and toiletries in the changeroom CONS 1. Poor customer service (sometimes its hard to tell the difference between staff and members... and the most popular members do get lots of extra attention from trainers, for free, on the floor). 2. Some REALLY poor instructors. As a spin enthusiast I was shocked to discover that at least one of the instructors couldn't keep up with the tempo of the music. 3. Single ply toilet paper and flimsy paper towel in the bathrooms. 4. Often messy toilet stalls, with missing toilet paper. 5. No nighttime maintenance, which means it all gets done WHILE you workout (I have more than once had people vacuuming right next to my head while benchpressing, or the shower stalls being pressure washed during prime time). 6. Hours only work if you run a Mon to Fri work schedule. Also, class offerings are lacking on the weekends. 7. Poor equipment maintenance- I once had to go to the hospital after cutting my finger on a piece of equipment that had been smashed and left to sit for weeks. I've also seen TV displays on equipment that are malfunctioning and remain so for weeks. 8. GM who doesn't respond to emails. My impression is that this is a gym where you go to see and be seen, and if that's important to you, Equinox is great. Otherwise, I would suggest that this is not a luxury fitness experience and your money would be better spent elsewhere. ",a year ago
231,Equinox W Georgia St,5.0,"It s the perfect place to relax, It has a lot of interesting classes, very good trainers and the customer service is amazing. Furthermore If you are Latino like me, they have Spanish-speaking trainers. This is awesome!",a year ago

234,Equinox W Georgia St,1.0,"Booked a gym visit with Elis and she s probably one of the most unfriendly and unhelpful equinox staffs I have experienced among all the branches in North America, including NYC and Toronto. There were no tour, no explanation of the facilities, and she was quite condescending. I always go with equinox and their PT for every city I am based in but oh well, Equinox Vancouver, you need to hire a better membership advisor.",a year ago

236,Equinox W Georgia St,1.0,"So I wanted to check this ""gym"" out to see what the fuss is all about. Called them up to get more info because its limited on their website. The receptionist who answered wasn't able or willing to answer the most basic questions and said that one of their agents/professionals/life coaches/gym gods(whatever they call them) will call me back... Guess what, never got a call back! I dont normally write reviews, yet here I wanted to make an exception. If you guys want to portrait yourselves as a serious company ""where luxury and fitness meet"", at least work on your customer acquisition strategies because that sort of experience definitely detered even the slightest amount curiosity I have left to visit your facility ",a year ago

243,Equinox W Georgia St,1.0,Too crowded gym Gets more and more crowded every day with shorter and shorter hours Dressed & went all the way on remembrance friday to find out the gym already closed at 4 without any prior notice or notification no email nor the app Just a piece of paper on the door saying today's working hours are 8am-4pm  the paper wasn't there even the day before There is no other gym in BC that closes so early. seriously 4pm??! What do people have more on a holiday? FREE TIME. What do people wanna do with their free time? WORKOUT! Is it just an office for the staff or what? Why should a gym close at 4pm afterall?? The other long weekend gym closed at 4pm on all 3days of the long weekend Take your money and find yourself a real gym that is open and there is actually space for your workout not a crowded zoo that is not even open half of the time Classes useless too cuz they are always full anyhow ,a year ago
244,Equinox W Georgia St,1.0,Poor management and customer service. They literally SCAM you and when you call to fix the issue they say their manager will call you and they never do. Do NOT come here if you value where your time and money goes. A complete joke and a waste of my time. Absolutely disgusted with how they go about their business. BE WARNED: they make money and call themselves  luxurious  by secretly never cancelling your membership when you ve already cancelled and stealing your money for MONTHS. A. COMPLETE. JOKE. I ll be speaking with your manager Equinox. A circus manages better than this establishment.,a year ago

247,Equinox W Georgia St,5.0,"I have a question, why can't the gym stay open 24/7 like anytime fitness, that's the reason why I go there, because after work hours or before I don't have too stress out if I have enough time too work out, if only Equinox would stay open 24/7, me and my family and friends would all sign up in a heart beat.",7 months ago

253,Equinox W Georgia St,1.0,"Extremely pushy staff before you become a member they bombard you with emails text messages & phone calls,    will go above and beyond while showing you the gym & signing the non-negotiable contract,,,,      once you become a member and trapped for a full year, all of sudden tables turn,,,,,     The very same people who were literally kissing A.. before, will disdain you,,,,    The high and mighty arrogant attitude at this location is TOO much ( I'm not talking about the MEMBERS, shockingly its about Staff & Managers),,,,     The gym itself doesn't meet the expectations, nor the hefty monthly fees. Sometimes it just looks like a crowded zoo. SHAME",a year ago

366,Anytime Fitness,5.0,"I joined to Anytime fitness 2 weeks ago. I am very happy so far, the staff is super friendly, the gym facilities are clean and in an excellent condition. Also, they provided a complimentary 2 personal trainer sessions. I just took the first session with the trainer Sharon, it was a full assessment about my fitness history and goals. I got a scan to figure the current situation of my health and fitness so we can start from there with the best plan to achieve my goals. One of the things that I love the most about AF is the 24 hrs access. My schedule at work can be very busy so the best time to work out for me is around 10:00/10:30 pm and I love that.

Also people have to bench in the squat rack which is absurd to me. As a woman, I feel uncomfortable every time I go because of how many men there are and their creepy stares. Lots of people that go don't need worldwide access to other gyms or classes so it's really dumb they force everyone to pay more for those ""benefits"".

534,House Concepts,5.0,"If you can afford it I can highly suggest. Variety of classes so you wont get bored. Especially loved boxing with Cindy(thank you for integrating some of the martial arts kicks, have never had this experience in any other boxing inspired fitness class!). She also took her time to explain the stance /correct posture. Artsy in Hero classes also paid utmost attention to inform us how to correctly carry out movements and what muscles should be engaged. Pilates with Megan and Page, a great addition after some of their more active classes. And changing rooms!! Felrl like an experience on its own. If you are travelling I would suggest their intro week pass. I was able to relax and take a proper shower. A lovely change from washing in the hostel and listening someone fighting with their morning diaharea in the next cubicle   Downside - Was hard to find a spot for stretching. Yoga blocks were not present. For the size of the studio and the niché they are operating in I was a bit disappointed. ",5 months ago
535,House Concepts,5.0,"Amazing gym. Beautiful layout, really knowledgeable instructors and fun environment. I usually go to Arty s classes and he s amazing. Explains movements very clearly while keeping it simple enough for beginners to easily follow along. He pushes you hard and makes working out really fun. :) I m a personal trainer myself and I 10/10 recommend. ",2 months ago
536,House Concepts,5.0,"I had a great time at House Concepts. The facility is top-notch, with everything you need to get the most out of your workout. I ve tried the Fuse class and some Float Boxing sessions, both of which proved to be incredibly enjoyable. Also, our team had our first 2023 teambuilding sweat boxing session with Michael, which was incredibly well done and everyone had a great time!! The front desk team are warm, welcoming, and are always accommodating to help ensure your experience is a positive one! I'd thoroughly recommend anybody in Vancouver check it out and I'm sure you won't be disappointed! ",a year ago

540,House Concepts,5.0,"House Concepts is the coolest gym that I have ever been to! It has everything that all of the boutique brands try to accomplish & more under one roof. Who needs f-45, Orange Theory, Oxygen Fitness or Crossift when you can have all of what they have to offer under one roof! They have nailed it! Giving people what they want...a variety of fun classes & the most professional instructors...all seemingly experts in their respective fields. The biggest downfall of those other places is they are franchised and the experience varies too greatly from one studio to the other. Oxygen is the worst for this. House is Young, Vibrant & seems to have an inclusive culture promoting fun, health & community. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of my classes from boxing to Plyometrics, Pilates & bench strength. AGAIN, The instructors are top notch. Fun friendly & Authentic. Notable is the fact that they supply all of the equipment & clean up after.the class ends. You simply show up for class & walk out..BRILLIANT !!!! Front desk staff have been very kind & sweet to me on every visit. The shower facilities are pristine & clean with people attending to the facility at all times. Highly recommend this ""Concept"" its worth every penny   Cindy ",5 months ago
541,House Concepts,5.0,"Feb 2023 update: House Concepts continues to be one of my favorite gyms in Vancouver! You can now book classes one week in advance on their Mind Body app/website. The coaches are consistently great and the Power classes have push, pull and full body programming now. The gym is so clean and organized and facilities continue to be top notch.   I have been coming to this gym for the last six months and I think it is finally time for me to write a review! Located right under the Granville Bridge and inside the Vancouver House, House Concepts is a gorgeous, aesthetic spot with 3 studios - Guest House, Basecamp Athletics and Butterfly Boxing. All the staff are super nice and professional, and the instructors are high energy and well-versed. I love how they always add new classes and host fun events (even with a DJ, food and other goodies). Amenities-wise, it s very nice. Two water stations, a locker room (you don t need to bring a lock), towels, nice sangre de fruta products, shower stalls, hair dryer, hair ties, deodorant etc. Class-wise, huge variety and depends what you want to work on. I find the guest house classes more  chill  but it just depends how much effort and weight you want to use. I love the Pilates, barre, yoga, peach season and house sculpt classes. Danielle is my favorite yoga teacher in Vancouver and Mobility with Dr. J is also phenomenal. The boxing classes are great and I love their bags here. You can borrow gloves and wraps from the front desk. There is sting boxing and float boxing but they re both similar - just depends on the rounds of boxing and the workouts in between. The weights are located underneath the bench and you workout and stretch to the left. It feels like a club in here sometimes - Arvin, Arty, and Tristan are my favorite boxing instructors. Last but not least, basecamp. It s cross training with the treadmill and then weights for two rounds. Rogue and fuse are pretty similar but power and bootycamp are a little different. Power is all floor work and the working on lifts. Bootycamp typically has no running and more glute focused. Niko, Arty, Jade and Rakan are all fantastic. Did I also mention all the people at the front desk are super nice and accommodating! The check in process is always so fast. Remember to book your classes on Monday - classes are released and the schedule is open on Monday at 11:00am. I would love to see more classes at House if possible - there s so much potential here! ",a year ago
542,House Concepts,1.0,"Front of house staff can be rude and will make a point of deliberately ignoring you. Super weird. If you have a moment check out their IG. Mostly, it's the receptionists posing and seeking attention. One of their videos actually seeks to mock customers if they look at the receptionist while they're struggling to find your details. Will definitely get a good sense of the place if you review their social platforms. Unfortunately, it represents them well. ",4 months ago

548,House Concepts,2.0,"The gym is nice but the way you pay for classes doesn t work for me. I signed up for a 5 pack of classes and only used 2 within the first 30 days. I didn t realize that the classes have a time limit on them for use so the other 3 ended up expiring. They offered to extend the classes for me for 1 more month but I couldn t use them because I was travelling, so I paid for 3 classes I never attended. After that I went back to buying single classes, but there is still no flexibility with those either. I ended up being late for a class one day and missed the 15 min cutoff. I called ahead to let them know I wasn t going to make it and asked if there was anything they could do to let me reschedule the credit for a different class. They said no. $35 down the drain and no workout for me. I ve spent so much money here on services I never got that I can no longer justify coming here. I m going to be looking for a new gym.",a year ago
549,House Concepts,3.0,"Great facility. took one of the boxing classes, found that the music and mic that the instructor was using was way too loud. I get that the class should be intense and the music should be loud but it was a bit overkill. Also, the staff at the front desk seems to be a bit unfriendly at times. Aside from that, the actual programs are great and I love the design of the place. EDIT: I see I'm not the only one complaining about the staff being unfriendly. I also did not get greeted or have anyone say goodbye as I was leaving. I think they should focus more on hiring friendly people instead of people that look good. ",a year ago

566,Studeo,4.0,"Despite poor google reviews, I actually recommend this place if you need a space to be hyper-focused. Cubicles are divided and are long enough to fit your laptop, books, etc. Their brewed coffee is a highlight too (one of the best I've tried near España). They use good coffee beans to keep you awake thru out the night. They also have pre-made iced coffee. The staff also look after the users as if they were their children, very parent vibe! One thing I would suggest is for them to invest more on good lighting as it often gets really dark at night. Maybe a little color on furniture/fixtures would be nice too to calm the eyes.

I guess there is still problem in the internet, there are times that the internet is still lagging for my online classes. The pantry offers hot and iced coffee, also lychee juice. I hope they refill the ice box because there were times there are no more ice. Also, there are no soap in the bathroom. Overall, it was a nice place to stay and be productive.

576,Spartacus Gym,1.0,"Absolute zero customer service when trying to cancel membership. Rude, non understanding and extremely poor communication. Had to go in 3 times just to cancel a gym membership. 18th September: Went to cancel in person. Guy at front desk told me it cannot be cancelled in person, send an email and you will get a quick response. 19th September: Sent email, no quick response. Went in again in evening, guy said he texted the owner and I will get email reply very soon. I told him I am moving away for a student exchange program in 4 days. And got charged on same day for upcoming month. I politely and humbly explained my situation, he said yeah the owner/supervisor can possibly give you a full or partial refund. He said he will cancel  but he DID NOT cancel it. 20th September: Went to see the supervisor this morning and expressed how troublesome it has been just to cancel a gym membership. Supervisor had no idea who worked on 18th and 19th. I asked her if its cancelled yet, supervisor did not tell and ignored my question. I tried to show the email I sent to cancel as told on 18th Sept, that too got ignored and brushed off. Furthermore, I brought up topic of partial refund as mentioned by person I talked to on 19th Sept. She said it is gym policy one month notice so no refund but it is cancelled now by her (FINALLY) and I will not be charged next month. I understand. When I referenced what I was told or promised by previous staff member, the supervisor said and I quote ""I don't believe it or you"". I was really shocked to hear that. Don't give misleading info to a customer about something that the other staff member claims is not possible. Plus the supervisor kept cutting me off repeatedly, very rude and non understanding towards a customer concern.
