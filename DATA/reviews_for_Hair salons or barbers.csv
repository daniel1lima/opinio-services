0,Cindy Haircuts,5.0,"Cindy haircuts are amazingly done for men and women. For me personally, nothing but the best because I've been searching for many barbers and stylist and found the best out there. Cindy actually takes her time to cut your hair the way you want it. Does not rush the service and makes sure you're satisfied. Amazing hair cut, been going to her for over 2 years and I have always been impressed. She washes the hair after the haircut which is a bonus with no additional cost. Highly recommended and is reasonably cheap compared to other hair salons/barbers. One quick tip, make sure you text her because she can be very busy in schedule. Hope this helped.",2015-02-13T09:28:50Z,1
1,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"High quality service, fast response, friendly staff. Strongly recommend. I went there for short haircut and hairstyle re-design.",2023-01-28T06:50:20Z,63
2,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"I used their straightening service twice before, and it lasted for a good four months. I've done japanese straightening in several other places over the years, also lasting around the same: months.
This time around, it barely lasted a month. :((
I brushed it off as maybe I wasn't drying it right, and went on with it, but it kept bugging me so I called them, only to be told it's ""semi-permanent"".  I'm feeling really disappointed. Not worth it.

And very quick research shows what japanese straightening is supposed to be: ""With Japanese hair straightening, human hair is permanently straightened with a special solution. The hair is then rinsed, then separated into sections dried and ironed. ... Once straightened, hair will not go back to its frizzy or curly form, although any new hair growth will maintain the natural texture of your hair.""

3,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"Great experience for a cheap haircut in downtown Vancouver! Parking is sometimes a little challenging to find, but definitely not a reason to not give this place a shot!",2023-05-21T03:17:01Z,63
4,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,Friendly service and quality hair cuts. I think I've had all the hairstylists cut my hair at some point and they've all been really good! There's ac inside which is nice as well on a hot day.,2021-07-05T20:02:48Z,63
5,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"I made an appointment for a haircut on a weekday morning. The hairstylist made sure we are clear on how much hair I want to trim off and let me know the pricing prior to cutting. 

Yuka was very polite and did a quick blowdry and style for my hair at the end. My appointment was done in 30 min for a 4 inch cut.  I was happy with my cut, and so I made my next appointment for a hair treatment.
 
Tip: if you plan to get your hair washed, you must specify this when you make the appointment so they can allot enough time for that",2017-12-10T00:19:39Z,63
6,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,Getting a haircut at Tsubaki is a wonderful experience and the stylists do a great job. The prices are very fair and the quality of the work they do is exceptional. Will definitely be back. Thank you!,2022-05-02T13:02:55Z,63
7,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,This is the place to go for a quick/hassle free trim or haircut if you're in downtown but don't want to spend $30+ on a haircut. I give this place a 4 star since it is reasonable for its price. I have been to nicer salons where I paid $45 for just a trim so this place is a saviour when it comes to a quick cleaning of split ends at $10. If you come here definitely don't expect anything fancy but do expect a service that is courteous and efficient.,2021-11-30T04:54:10Z,63
8,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"I got my hair done here today and was very impressed with the service! My stylist was Rina, she gave me gorgeous silver/blonde highlights and a haircut. She worked very efficiently and gently, all the staff are extremely polite and friendly. The salon itself isn't a fancy place but it's very conveniently located and more affordable than other salons I've been to for the same service. I'll definitely come back here and recommend to friends!",2020-07-15T21:08:30Z,63
9,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"Great job cutting my hair as an Asian man. Very polite service, fast, and very reasonable prices. I called ahead for an appointment but I think you can walk in if you're willing to wait.",2019-07-05T23:43:39Z,63
10,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"I would probably come back here for the haircut. They are polite and price is more than reasonable, and you can usually get an appointment within a few days. 
However I feel like the hair dye experience is subpar for it's price $85. The chemical used has very unbearable smell and still prominent after 1 week.",2019-10-19T23:23:59Z,63
11,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"As I sat down for the haircut, I asked my hairstylist how long will it take for the hair color, and he told me how much it would be instead.  Then he showed me the scissors (which was odd because he didn't need to do that) when he asked me if I want my hair to be thinner.  When I asked him to show me the ends of my hair while he was holding the mirror at the back, he just looked at me and showed me the back of my head instead.  I gave up on talking to him.  They had an additional hairstylist to blow dry my hair and he was disturbingly rough (he shook my head with his fingers and kept hitting my jaw which was unnecessary).

When I looked into the mirror after I left, I realized that one side of my hair was shorter than the other side and it was obvious.  This was unacceptable.  No wonder they gave me a cheaper price (I was surprised when I saw the bill but now I know why).",2019-05-13T00:22:40Z,63
12,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"It is so convient to find a salon in downtown that have appointments readily available when you call in to book.  Their service is super quick but they also ensure your hair cut and colour is to your liking. My hairstylist had to re-dye my hair twice for touch up  because she wasn't happy with how the colour didn't match my initial dye. It is great to know 00ylist takes the effort in the quality of their work! Everyone is super friendly there.  Note, colouring typically doesn't include the cost of the blow and dry. But they offered me free blow and dry because I had haircut with 7 days before my hair dye session. Or else the cost would have been an additional $5 for the twins",2017-12-16T07:42:23Z,63
13,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"Tsubaki Hair Express is definitely a ""best bang for your buck"" sort of hair salon, with no frills nor hidden charges. 

I started coming here a few months ago since my friend had recommended it to me and I found on google maps that the salon was only a 10 minute walk away from work.  I actually get my hair cut once a month and it's usually during lunch-time since their cuts only take 30 minutes if you choose to do the one inch trim, without wash and blowdry.  

I basically only pay $15 (+tax + tip so ~$17.50-$18) for my cut and I usually book my appointment when they open in the morning at 10am.  For women it's $18 for a trim and I feel that it's extremely reasonable since they also layer your hair and such.  My stylist is Noriko and she's extremely polite and really puts in effort into making your hair look nice, even with the time constraints.

My mother comes here as well (we both actually used to go to Chura) and she normally goes for the $18 trim + $7 shampoo/blowdry, and occasionally the $18 trim + $20 treatment+shampoo/blowdry.  It's an extremely good deal because she normally gets a trim every 5-6 weeks so Tsubaki's services are perfect for her!  If you want a full haircut (as in like... a complete style change, eg: going from chest length hair to a short bob) then it's $25 or something. (For guys its $20 but I don't know many guys who request for such dramatic changes)",2014-10-26T00:26:40Z,63
14,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"In Dec after class at BCIT I found this salon by chance.  Saw the price list, very reasonable, and decided to go in for a trim that's long overdue. I was very lucky and got in without an appointment.  Char was my stylist and she was attentive to my requests and did a very good job with my hair.

Now I needed another trim again and called to book an appt with Char but she doesn't work on Saturdays.  I got Ai this time and she did a fantastic job as well. 

I paid $25+tax+tips for a trim (more than 1 inch).  I think it's very reasonable.  Who needs a fancy wash anyway.  They're quick and you can probably do it during lunchtime.",2017-03-19T00:56:49Z,63
15,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"The service is always good. And the staffs here are very friendly. 
I get my hair cut and shampoo done for about $27 including tips. LOVE this place",2017-07-29T02:34:02Z,63
16,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"Yay! I didn't know we had this genre of Japanese hair salon in Vancouver: utilitarian, not glam. Like the ones you'd find beside train stations and you walk in without an appointment.

I found this place on Yelp looking for Inexpensive Japanese Hair Salon. The first inkling I got that this place was different was when I phoned to make an appointment: they said they didn't need my phone number, since it was just a cut. The next was when I walked in, and there was a guy sitting in a client chair blow-drying his own hair...

Usually, even when I ask for a ""cut"", the salon gives me a ""cut and shampoo"", and I go along with it. This place didn't!! I""m so happy, not just because it makes it cheaper ($15+HST+tip=$20), but it takes forever to dry my long and heavy hair. I was out in 45 minutes! That never happens!

I was happy with the result. Normal Japanese skills good. The stylist properly connected my bangs to the rest of my hair and reduced the volume, as is usually done. I would go to my regular place to drastically change my style, but this is a good quick stop for touch-up trims (when my normal salon is booked 2 weeks in advance).",2010-11-12T07:17:24Z,63
17,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"I just called them today after saw many good reviews about this place. And I got a spot directly for an appointment around 2 pm (try to come around 1-2pm since usually, it is super busy around 3 pm).
I cut my hair with stylish named Nori. She was super friendly and skillful.
I just told her that any hairstyle is okay (since I have no clue what's best for me).
And she was able to know what haircut suit me best.
The result is incredible!
Definitely, will come back and do my hair treatment there!",2017-03-14T22:37:03Z,63
18,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"I've been getting Japanese straightening for the past 10 years, usually in Asia or hair salons in Richmond (for their low prices). I decided to give Tsubaki in downtown a try because I was getting tired of the wait time at those hella busy Richmond salons. 

My appointment was on a Thursday afternoon, booked via phone. I've never been here so I didn't ask for a specific stylist. My stylist was Yusuke, who took care of my Japanese treatment from beginning to end with impeccable detail! The stylists at the salons I've been to previously always take on 1 or 2 customers during my treatment because there's a wait time for the solution to take effect on my hair, but Yusuke was focused on my hair the whole time. Due to my insane amount of hair, he got some assistance during the blowdrying/straightening session. When it came to the cut, he made sure what length I wanted, and he layered the hair beautifully.

Half of my hair was previous straightened, so my treatment was only $150 (for medium length hair). $25 for the cut and $7 for shampoo, this treatment only came to $190 with tax in the end! This is an amazing price considering most places charge $300+ nowadays! A definite thumbs up :)!!",2016-03-28T23:21:40Z,63
19,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"I had a great hair cut with a very reasonable price. She was very confident and im happy.
Vustomer service is amazingly good.
Highly recommended.
I have tried a few in downtown area and now decided to come here from now on. You can take advantage of my search and go to them. Others like Robson barbers are too arrogant and intrusive.",2017-01-20T22:36:12Z,63
20,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"I've been to this salon twice now and each time I had to wait even though I booked appointments in advance. First time I waited around 20 minutes, second time around 10. 

The hair cut is decent but don't expect it to be spectacular or anything. You do get what you pay for. Its a good place for a quick cheap trim, just don't try to get any drastic style change.",2016-06-04T18:52:22Z,63
21,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,The value for the price is on point. Great quality with Japanese courtesy. I have been back several times.,2018-03-24T16:55:01Z,63
22,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"Best haircut in town, don't pay $50 for a haircut just because the place is new and has some cucumber water

$15 they clean you up and make you feel fresh for the weekend

As good if not better than japanese haircuts in Tokyo

Ask for Oya, tell him Scott sent you. You'll need an appointment a day or two in advance",2015-07-10T20:19:55Z,63
23,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"Oya is the best. Hesitant to post this review because he is so booked up, but seriously hes awesome. Great fades, and he has a very unique technique when cutting hair.",2017-05-13T06:19:35Z,63
24,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"Tsubaki hairstylists do a wonderful job with thick, stick-straight hair like mine. Among the best haircuts I've ever had.

The stylists at Tsubaki are all Japanese and cater principally to a hip, young Japanese clientele, and thus are very adept at creating via texturing and layering the kind of pixyish, intricate cuts that are fashionable across the Pacific right now. Long hair, short hair--the results are equally striking. If you don't come with a look already in mind, you're likely to have no trouble finding the perfect 'do in the Japanese hair magazines on offer. Hundreds of styles, most X100 cuter and hipper than the cheerleader - soccer mom nonsense in your typical American hair salon ""look book"".

And such a bargain. Under $20 for a cut and blow-dry. $25 if you want to radically alter your look.

I am now completely sold on Japanese hair salons.",2010-07-02T00:12:52Z,63
25,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"Let's get one thing straighten out. They display a large sign outside stating ""$15 Hair Cuts!!"". This is a false advertisement. It is $15 only if you cut 1 inch of hair or less. So really, it should say ""$15 Trims!!"".  Now I don't know any girls who would go to a salon to trim less than 1 inch of hair - isn't that a waste of time and money? ""$15 Men Hair Cuts!!"" would also work.

My cut ended up being $25, which is decent but not that great in terms of value. I was in and out of the salon within 35 min, and that was including a 10 min wait. That's lightning fast and although not necessarily indicative of a poor job, it does make me feel a little weary. I prefer a stylist who takes his/her time.  And $25 did not include wash or blow-dry.

The cut was nothing to rave about. I would not go back for anything more than a trim, and I'll have to make sure they cut  no more than 1 inch.  It was also a little difficult to communicate with the Japanese stylist who spoke minimal English.  I think I'd rather save my money towards a quality cut somewhere else.",2011-10-19T19:37:08Z,63
26,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"This is by far the cheapest place if you're looking to have the Japanese Hair Straightening done. (rest of their services are very affordable as well) My hair is about 16 inches long, (so considered 'long') and costs $170 for the straightening and $10 for shampoo and blow-dry. (other places would easily charge double that).

Service is very good, though this might not be the place for you if you want to do a lot of chit chat with your stylist, especially if you don't speak Japanese as their English isn't always that good. For me that's perfectly fine as I like to read on my tablet instead. They used to share the salon with a barber shop run by one old man, but now it seems like Tsubaki runs the entire place. 

The place is kept fairly clean and appointments are on time. Very good services for affordable prices!",2014-07-29T17:35:07Z,63
27,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"Ladies, I'm sure you all feel a bit ripped off when you go in for a trim and have to pay over $30.00 for it, well go to Tsubaki and use the extra money on a mani/pedi instead!

Although located in downtown, this little shop is unpretentious and is as basic as it gets.  The space is actually split between Tsubaki and a barber.  Kind of interesting to see the clash of culture and generations.  One side you have the funky, young japanese hair stylists and on the otherside you have the old school, yakkity yak senior barbers.  Regardless, they seem to be sharing the space very respectfully and professionally.

Didn't think I would need an appointment but I made one anyways, and thank god I did seeing how they got quite busy around that time.  I was in and out in 30 minutes, my trim is exactly what it is, and my hair did not get washed hence didn't require a blow dry.  My bill came to $16.90 including tax and I tipped $3.00.  

For anything more than a trim, I would go back to my regular stylist, but for a quick trim or clean up, this is the place to go!",2011-01-16T23:03:23Z,63
28,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"This is the perfect place to get a trim if your hair is getting a little long but you want to keep your current style. The cut started out with a discussion on what I wanted done. I also like to ask the stylist for their opinion, and after some observation, the stylist (Ai) gave me an outline of how she was going to trim my hair. Ai was quick, yet paid attention to detail. There is no wash/shampoo (one of my favourite parts of a salon visit), but you get what you pay for. Thirty minutes from start to finish and under $20 including tip.",2016-11-06T21:07:58Z,63
29,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"I've never had a bad haircut in my life. 

I'm not saying that because I have awesome hair but because I get the easiest haircuts possible. Long hair, side bangs. No fuss, no frills. 

This was the worst haircut of my life and I was in tears at some point. 

I asked for sidebangs but for some odd reason she failed to understand the picture I showed her of myself (so it's definitely possible on my head) in sidebangs and I ended up with STRAIGHT BANGS. THAT'S RIGHT. THE BIGGEST NIGHTMARE THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN TO A TWENTY-SOMETHING YEAR OLD TRYING TO LOOK PROFESSIONAL. FRONT. STRAIGHT. LITTLE GIRL. BANGS. 

I kept telling her look, the bangs are supposed to split at some point so they become SIDE and not STRAIGHT bangs but she insisted that she cut sidebangs. 

After a lot of time explaining and her smiling unapologetically, and a picture diagram by me, my hair wasn't any better so I decided to just cut my losses and just pin up the sad remains of my bangs for the next two months.

If you see a sad Asian girl with her bangs pinned up, chances are it's me. 

Should've known to go to a legit salon.",2013-08-31T00:59:26Z,63
30,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"They do a good job cutting hair, and they are quite nice. I guess because I am Indian (from India, Columbus was looking for US), they are sorta thrilled or something that I speak their language to a degree. So, they are really nice folk. But, I don't speak it perfectly, and that's a problem.

I've been here before, but I think I won't return. Most of the stylists do not speak English well, which has led to confusion and me not getting the ideal hair cut in times past. I would say, if you speak Japanese perfectly, you should go here. The pricing is quite reasonable and the quality is good. But non-Japanese speaking folk should perhaps steer clear.",2012-05-29T18:11:03Z,63
31,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"Not all Japanese stylists are made the same. I asked for a trim instead she cut my hair too short and it's not even. 

I had an appointment but she was in a rush. She wanted me to wait halfway between the cut so she can work on another person who they claimed waited a long time. 

I would not recommend.",2017-02-27T16:20:48Z,63
32,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"I get a hair cut once a year and sometimes a trim at the 6 month mark. I hate having to spend more than $40, just to trim off about 2 inches or less. Tsubaki express meets my needs. They offer trims starting from $15. Shampoo and dry is extra. For the price you pay I think they do a very good job. My little brother also comes here to get his hair cut and never once heard a complaint.",2016-07-05T23:45:11Z,63
33,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"Did not get my hair done.  This is my experience when I called asking about their services and pricing.
I asked what they charge for color.  I was quoted $55 plus another $55 if she has to reapply color.  ?  I'm confused.  Before I could ask for clarification, I heard click...

Perhaps they are better at hair straightening and men's cuts.  I simply didn't get the feeling I would be in good hands.",2016-04-09T04:29:19Z,63
34,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"Best haircut of my life, and I went to hair school! 

I've been here more than once. The cut is quick and inexpensive (depending on how much I can afford cut and tips will come to max $20), and my hair feels so soft and light when I leave. The style does not fall out after I sleep (as sometimes when you go to the salon they style it to something you can never achieve on your own at home), it is the same the next day. 

The stylists are quiet and polite, and somehow always know exactly what I want. 

Perfect!",2015-04-15T22:15:45Z,63
35,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"Been going here for the past 6 years. Customer service has always been great. Everyone who works there greets you. Can't beat the price as well for a haircut for Downtown Vancouver. Oya was my preferred stylist. I'm usually in and out of there in 20-25 mins. Just be specific as to what you would like your cut to look like and he'll deliver. He's no longer working for Tsubaki Hair Express, but he has moved to Essi's on West Pender.",2018-07-17T18:02:22Z,63
36,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"Pretty solid and depending on time of day/stylist you get you either get
a) good cut but rushed service for amazing price dt ($15+ tax)
b) good cut and still friendly service for (again) amazing price given dt.

As a guy it's hard not to ask more.

Cactus Club for haircuts it's not, so if you're a gaijin looking to pick up cute Japanese hairstylists this is likely not your joint. But for under $20 with tips haircut no frills it's hard to beat this place.",2014-12-22T00:34:35Z,63
37,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"I appreciate the good-nature of the hairdresser that attended to me on my first visit: friendly, seemingly attentive and genuinely curious about what I wanted to do with my hair; but the overall experience wasn't all that good.

My hair is pixie-style short and I'm slowly growing it out, so I was in for a trim and just looking for a tidy up. Unfortunately my hairdresser seemed a little thrown and confused about what I thought was a simple request: it took almost an hour for a trim and the whole time they sported a confused/troubled look on their face. 

Perhaps I'd have had a better experience if I had the more common oriental female hairstyle that's ""feminine""/long/curly(?). They might be well-priced for downtown, but about an hour for a simple trim/tidy up on some very short hair that would usually take 15-20minutes.. And feeling no where relaxed since the hairdresser seemed to find the task challenging.. I won't be inclined to return. 

Sadly this was not an hour + $20 well spent. I'll wait till my usual people have availability for sure!",2016-04-06T00:06:03Z,63
38,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,I booked an appointment with one of their stylist for 12 but when I show up on the day they told me my appointment was at 2 rather.  I ended up paying for parking and wasting time as well as money going there just not to have my appointment. They need receptionist who is able to listen.

41,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"I have been getting my haircuts from Yuka for over 3 years ~ 

i always called in to book an appointment and asked for Yuka.  

Maybe once or twice, I was in a rush to get my hair cut and so i just did a drop-in to have whoever was on staff to cut my hair.  

it works best to communicate or have a picture of what you want - i usually choose a hairstyle from one of the Japanese magazines provided and she consults with me about what can be done with my hair. 

I used to cut my own hair before coming here - because of work reasons i needed to get a more presentable hairstyle. :P 

Sometimes I just leave it to Yuka to decide for me the type of hairstyle to get.  She has better judgement than me because she takes into account of my hair texture, thickness, direction of growths and face shape, etc.  

I almost fell asleep when i got my hair washed - the scalp massages were so good ~ haha

The decor of the place is very minimal - nothing fancy or flashy, just practical and the essentials.",2014-01-14T06:02:59Z,63
42,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"I've been getting my hair done here for a little over a year (except for the time I cut my own hair) and have to say, it's an amazing deal with wonderful, fast service.

A hair treatment AND cut is just over $35. Where else can you get that?

Makoto was also able to fix the mess I made of my hair (I don't care what YouTube tutorials say, don't try to save money by cutting your own hair- it's not worth it). 

I have paid three or four times as much for a cut that looks perfect in the shop but I can never re-create it at home so for me It doesn't matter that he isn't fluent in English because Makoto was able to look at how my hair sits and know precisely how to shape and style it so it looks its best- not just on the day of the hair-cut but months later.

As an added bonus, if you get the treatment, the salon also gives you a sample of Snob Girls hair oil gel-caps. My hair is naturally dry at the ends and it just soaks this stuff up!",2013-05-17T00:11:44Z,63
43,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"Wha?!? This place is great! After reading the reviews I decided to give it a go after work. I'm super broke right now and can't afford a fancy salon. No worries! I walked in and was able to get a trim right away (maybe I got lucky). The girl was perfectly nice, we didn't really talk and I think that was just fine. She did a really nice job! My hair is very thick, and tends to be a bit poufy/frizzy (trying to masquerade as wavy/messy/natural ;) ). She blow dried it into smoother curls, straightened it out around my crown, and then teased it up a bunch as well. I really liked it. I'm considering coming back once in a while just for a blow dry... once I can afford those kinds of luxuries, of course.",2011-10-28T03:02:08Z,63

She did an amazing job. I asked for u-shape from the back with a bit of layers. As well, I asked for my hair thinned out a bit (it was very heavy).

51,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"This place was recommended by my coworker and I decided to give it a try. I walked in one day and the girl hairstylist wasn't available so this guy booked me an hour later. I really should have waited for the girl stylist...

I asked him to trim at first but he really didn't do much so
I told him to cut a bit shorter then he said it's not trimming anymore so he would have to charge $25. well.. I said ok. then he started chopping my hair away without asking how I wanted so I had to stop him in the middle of it.

I told him this is not how I wanted but he said ' you pay 25, I change the style! ' He speaks very little English so it was hard to express my frustration. 

Instead, I think he should have paid me $25 for the emotional damage that I suffer every time I look in the mirror...and this was 3 months ago!",2011-06-07T03:38:39Z,63

61,Tsubaki Hair Express,3.7,"I came here as Chura was full and I didn't want to have to wait any longer to cut my hair. I wouldn't say that it's horrible, but I have absolutely no intention of returning to this salon again.

I asked my stylist to cut my hair 2 inches shorter and for some layers. Granted  I did say that I want to keep the same volume but I feel she took my words too close to heart. I had to ask her to keep trimming and layeriing it 3 times until I became almost too embarrassed to ask for anymore and decided to go home and ask a friend to help me finish the job instead. 
 Despite having urged her to continue cutting, the difference between the before and after is so minimal it's hard to see that I had gotten a haircut. 
Thanks to another user's review, I knew the usual hair wash wasn't going to be included but didn't expect it to be a fully 100% dry cut either. I have very long and pretty thick hair and it was interesting to watch her trim and layer it without pining up any parts of my hair until she finally mustered up the will to confirm with me that I understood the pricing system and that if I wanted her to continue cutting, it was going to be $25 and not $15. After I assured her that I knew it was $25, she started cutting a tad more aggressively. I don't mind paying $25, but I really feel that it was unprofessional of the stylist to have not confirmed with me, the customer from the start.",2013-01-27T04:36:38Z,63

66,Regal Grooming Lounge,4.4,"I really enjoy coming here - great service and very competent staff.
I just do a simple buzz cut and it's very reasonably priced.
I don't give it five stars (super close) due to a couple of fairly minor things in the overall scheme.

A few weeks ago, when I booked an appointment, they suggested I get a shave.  I explained that I have very sensitive skin and over the years many barbers have tried without great results.
It took me years to find the right blend of products and razor to achieve a smooth injury free shave at home.

She was very confident that they would be able to deliver.

So I agreed - while the shaving experience is amazing with steam and curated, the poor guy who tried his best was very apologetic with the results.

To his credit, I wasn't bleeding at all :-), however I needed to shave when I got home.

It's a relatively expensive (but worth it for most people) treatment that was uncomfortable and didn't yield great results.  I will trust my instincts next time and not do that!

Also, when I booked an appointment today, the woman really struggled - with the details around time and date that I had to repeat several times (in person). And then had trouble with the app on the computer.

All in all, labour is hard in this town, I love the space and the service and I will continue to go, but for me personally, the shave was  bit of a waste of money - my fault for being talked into it!",2019-07-17T23:41:35Z,49
67,Regal Grooming Lounge,4.4,"Came in for first time there and will definitely be back. Victor was a wizard and cleaned up my scraggly beard and made it look great, service was quick but not to the point I felt rushed. Great work",2021-07-20T22:24:09Z,49
68,Regal Grooming Lounge,4.4,"In town for work for a few days and was in need of a beard line up, hair trim and facial. Easy to book on their web site. I arrived 10 min early and the nice girl checking in and out customers offered me a drink and seat at the bar. She's very welcoming and professional. Nice old school, yet modern barbershop. Ashley I.  came out within just a couple minutes to greet me and took be make for my 30 minute express facial. She did a great job. Nothing fancy but just a solid steam, face wash, exfoliate, charcoal mask and moisture. Hot towel treatments throughout. All done in a private booth away from the barber floor. Face felt great afterwards.

After Ashley I. was done, Kim C. greeted me and led me to her chair for my beard line up, hair trim and shampoo/condition. She was very nice and welcoming. 
She did a nice, detailed job with my beard line up with the straight razor. Took her time. I have just two small issues with Kim C...

Issue #1... When I sat down in her chair, I clearly said only clean the hair up around my ears and back of my neck, no taper, no fade and no haircut as I'm growing everything out. After she did a nice job around my ears and neck and before I could say anything, she started to blend in and cut some hair after I specifically instructed her not to. It wasn't much and I should've been paying attention more so it wasn't a huge deal breaker for me. Issue #2... She acted a shocked that I wanted to shampoo and condition even though I didn't receive a haircut. I thought that was odd as I'm the customer paying for the service... therefore don't question it or make me look weird for something I'm willing to pay you for.

Overall this place is great and I recommend them. They have a nice selection of products for sale. Accepts credit cards and cash. TVs within each barber's mirror and a TV at the bar.",2018-09-08T00:25:28Z,49
69,Regal Grooming Lounge,4.4,"Ive never had to write a review before but i am disappointed by my experience here. Went in for beard shaping to get my beard trimmed and line fixed. Ashley started off great by fading the sides of the beard using the trimmer but as she started to fix the beard lines it was obvious that it was not even. It was easily noticeable by just looking at the mirror. I had to tell Ashley the sides aren't symmetrical and after a second look she realized it wasn't even, saying ""oh this side is just a bit more pointy"". She tried fixing it up, but I could still tell it wasn't very even, see the picture attached. She then started to shave parts of my neck and face to give the beard more shape but she was holding the straight razor at almost a 45 degrees angel going against the grain. This caused a lot of irritation and cuts. 12 hours after my visit my neck is still red and burns. See picture attached. 

At some point she pointed out that my hair grows out in many directions so it's very difficult to use the straight razor. Instead she switched to an electric shaver and just used that. If I wanted to use an electrical shaver then I would have just stayed at home. I've been to many barber shops in Seattle and never had any issues. All the barbers I've visited used straight razors and have never cause such discomfort. This was NOT worth 30 dollars. 

Reason I tried regal grooming: I came up from Seattle for a wedding and wanted to get a nice beard trim and clean up before the wedding. I spent some time searching reviews and sites for recommendations and I found that regal grooming seemed to be one of the top. I wouldn't recommend it.",2017-09-03T06:31:25Z,49
70,Regal Grooming Lounge,4.4,"Regal is my second home, and I'm probably their biggest fan. I've had the monthly subscription for about two years now, and I'll be honest - it's a game changer. 

Every week I come in for a glass of scotch, a straight razor touch up, a shoe shine, and I have my fade cleaned up. High maintenance, I know. 

But grooming is just part of the experience for me. I love coming in to hangout and catch up with everyone, and unwind after a long week. The room is beautiful, and it's a great place to just kick back for a bit. 

I guarantee once you get the membership, there's no going back - it's a total no brainer considering what you get. Love this place",2017-12-19T21:59:18Z,49
71,Regal Grooming Lounge,4.4,"I've been a customer since 2015 - and would give 5 stars for Rua'a and Michelle who have cut my hair consistently since 2015 and done a great job.  Graham has also given me a haircut on a couple of occasions and does a stellar job.

The three stars is for the value for service now.  The monthly package used to be great value and gave me a chance to tip stylist more since the cost of the cuts were set for the month, however the prices have now gotten to the point where it's no longer good value.

I personally don't need a drink or a shoe shine when I come in for a haircut.  If the membership plan ever gets down to a reasonable level again, I'll be back... the stylist are all great to deal.  Until then it's time for me to find a new place for my regular cut.

75,Regal Grooming Lounge,4.4,"Booked online with Graham due to the reviews on here.  Got to the shop and was advised that I was actually booked with another barber.  Wasn't too happy as the reason I booked online was so I could choose the barber I wanted.  I needed a cut so went with it.  Atmosphere was nice, barber was very friendly and asked what I wanted done. Place was very clean and the cut/fade seemed good until I got home and checked in the mirror.  

The fade line was still obviously there and very noticeable.  Areas around my side burns had hairs that were noticeable longer and missed by the clipper.  The fact that they scheduled me with a different barber is tolerable, but the bad fade was disappointing.  I had to end up using my own wahl's to fade the line out myself as I could not go out like that.

The barber didn't give me a chance to check out the back of my head or I would have probably noticed the fade issue and had them fix it on the spot.  I guess I should have asked, and will ask from now on. 

Was contacted by the owner immediately after my review, who went above and beyond to correct the situation. Was not expecting to be contacted. By the consistent reviews,  my experience was obviously a one off. I appreciate the follow up by the owner.",2016-02-12T23:50:49Z,49

I showed a picture of the state of my hair a couple months ago that I liked and asked for something similar - just a clean up, nothing more, nothing less. I ended up with, most likely one of the worst haircuts I've had in my life. Once the person cutting my hair took the electric buzzer to my hair and cut off a chunk way more than I was comfortable with, there wasnt any going back. A $45 cut should not end in less than 15 minutes. There was no care and I dont see myself coming back here.",2020-02-14T02:14:42Z,49

He listened and followed all my specifics about my hair (I have wierd hairline so I get the part on the sides and back a bit lower.) The actual cut turned out pretty good and Amar is a really cool guy.

My gripes are:
 - Amar kinda failed to style it, he tried though.
 - The price, came to ~34 before tip. I knew this though, but it wasn't really worth the price.
 - I asked for a haircut and style package (which includes hair washing and style $40) but he only gave me the cheaper regular cut ($33)... but he styled it for free... so theres that I guess.

80,Regal Grooming Lounge,4.4,"This place tries hard and has good reviews, but I found it to be average at best. I've been here twice, each time with a different hair cutter. The first haircut was 'okay,' had a few mistakes, but was well done enough for me to cautiously return. 

The second time I saw a different woman who gave me literally the worst haircut of my life. Shaved like some kind of strange poodle or topiary, and two days later, bits  and tufts are sticking out everywhere.  She had no idea where my part was and I had to clean up some stray dangly bits myself. Even though I asked to leave it as long as possible, it's so short it can't even be fixed for months. 

It's also a bit concerting how both times they whipped out a straight razor without even asking. A person walking up behind you with a murder weapon is not the sort of thing you want to see in the mirror. Especially without asking.

Usually offered a beverage, final time I was not. I'm not kidding you, I could have done a better job myself in the dark while drunk. I can trim my own beard for free. I pay to have it done as a man-pamper to myself, as a luxury. Forget the service aspect, these barbers just plain need training, they have no clue.

The shot of scotch or a beer is welcomed.    Haircut got me just the look I wanted and a close blade shave of my neck and all is good again.    I'd definitely return and see Simone next time I'm in town.",2016-08-07T00:10:06Z,49

98,Regal Grooming Lounge,4.4,"First time coming here and visiting from Portland, all the people are very nice and friendly. Very comfortable atmosphere with seating I almost fell asleep in. Got a beard trim and haircut from Valerie and was pleased with both the service and quality of her work. She turned my wild Portland beard into a clean Vancouver approved masculine facial fluff. Waiting isn't too bad but I could see how the place could get busy so scheduling would probably save a little wait. Worth your time and money for sure, I will be stopping by the next time I'm in Vancouver-",2016-01-22T03:45:17Z,49
99,Regal Grooming Lounge,4.4,If I lived here I would be a member.  They turned my 0/5 trim into an event with a hot towel wrap and warm shave of the neck.  An offer of beer or scotch sealed the deal.  If you want/desire a barber experience go here and enjoy.,2015-09-02T05:21:55Z,49

102,Regal Grooming Lounge,4.4,"Regal Grooming Lounge is so amazing that I've had Wednesday's at 4 PM booked with Michelle for the last 3 years. I've been coming here since they were at the smaller ""mom and pop shop"" style and have watched them grow in to the beautiful space they are in now! Their service is impeccable the moment you step through the doors. Jackie or Jue will greet you, grab your coat, and ask if you want a glass a of scotch, a beer or recently a coffee. If you're early for your appointment, check out Garrison Bespoke in the back. They have beautiful custom tailored suits and Will and Rich would be happy to chat with you. Sometimes I go early or stay late at the shop because they have bar you can sit at to get some work done and even charge your phone. Sometimes you'll even run in to the owner, Angelo! He is one of the most humble businessmen I know. I have had a haircut from each one of the staff while Michelle is away and they are all great! I just love the Michelle's Irish accent ;). They have a good selection of hair products and would be happy to recommend what works for your hair! Lots of love for all of Regal. Excited for Robbie to come back one day!",2017-12-14T03:36:41Z,49

106,Regal Grooming Lounge,4.4,"The pinnacle of barbershops. Simone is a God amongst men. Some even say a statue has been erected in Italy as a testament to the man they once housed. His skills are somehow sharper than actual razor blades. Particles of stainless steel grow up wanting to achieve the highest honour known to them: to be crafted into scissors that Simone uses. Rumour has it, that even if Simone completely lost his vision, he'd still be able to cut hair better than anyone, like Neo still being able to see after he loses his eyes in the Matrix Revolutions film. Jackie, Ju, and Lu (sp?) are so awesome that they should have been cast as the upcoming Charlie's Angels instead of the cast for the 2019 reboot. Always enthusiastic, fun, funny, and a good time to be around. If I ever move back to Vancouver, it won't be because of the ocean, the mountains, or the beaches. It won't be because of the hiking, a job, or friends and family. It will be because I need to come back to Regal Grooming Lounge.",2019-08-30T20:53:35Z,49

The receptionist was very friendly and pleasant to deal with, especially since they were quite busy.

I came in and sat down with my family and  waited for Aaron, when it was my time he greeted me with a fist bump and invited me to have a seat. I described how I like my hair and never had to repeat myself, we figured out a good length and he knocked it out. Aaron had an idea to preserve my sons dyed hair but clean it up so my boy jumped in and got a tapered cut, we both walked out very happy.",2023-08-02T21:52:05Z,62

117,Ace High Barber Shop,4.6,"First off, I can be a really hard to please asshole. Having said that, my first experience here was absolutely top notch from start to finish. I walked in looking like a slob and walked out looking like a movie star. 

I live in a cabin in the woods a couple thousand miles from this place and I don't do a lot of grooming at home. Why bother if nobody's going to see it? I flew into town to work with a high profile client and needed to get cleaned up fast. 

On the flight, I found on Yelp that this place is highly rated. I used Yelp's ""Request an appointment"" feature, not expecting it to work. Surprisingly, I got a text back within a couple minutes and was lucky to get an appointment for three hours later. 

Already impressed, I arrived looking like shit and was warmly greeted by Scotty. I told him I didn't know what the heck kind of haircut I wanted but just to please make me look really good. I told him I don't care what I look like, but I want other people to think I look good, so I asked him to do what he thought would suit me. He went to work and did an amazing job transforming my appearance. Minimal small talk and refreshingly witty. A hard balance to strike but it seemed easy to him. 

I got a fantastic haircut for $25 and an excellent beard trim for $15 more. He did not try to push buying product on me, which I appreciated. 

I highly recommend this place and Scotty for anybody who wants to look good.",2017-08-02T03:02:37Z,62

120,Ace High Barber Shop,4.6,"I'm from San Francisco and have specific barbers I go to back home, so venturing out is a big risk for me. After looking through Yelp, I gave it a shot and walked through downtown to Ace High Barber. 

Vicky took really great care of me - she was attentive, thorough, and an all around nice person.  I left with one of the best haircuts i've had in a while (I normally get a mid skin fade and trim on top). I wish Vicky could come back to the Bay Area with me to keep cutting my hair :(

Go here, they'll take care of you....and it's pretty cheap! I would pay almost double the price in San Francisco area for the same service.",2018-03-11T23:33:51Z,62
121,Ace High Barber Shop,4.6,"Called ahead, spoke to Rodney who was helpful and booked an appointment.

Had my haircut by Anna who seemed nervous and serious through almost the entire interaction. I had showed Anna a few examples of how I would like my hair to look after the cut, but somehow still ended up with a cut longer than what I asked for. Basically, after two requests for my hair to be cut shorter and almost 45-minutes in the barber chair, I'll admit I had to give up being persistent (I would have been late to an appointment) and so left without even getting a quick wash to get the little bits of hair out. 

It definitely made me feel awkward - that feeling like the barber assigned to my appointment, Anna, was so resistant to cutting my hair to the length I wanted.  Surely in 2018 I should not be expected to have ""longer"" hair just because I'm female, much less be made to feel that way by a barber! While I appreciate the time she took to cut my hair, I don't think I'd ever had a barber cut exceed a half hour and still be longer than I'd wanted.

Turns out it was Anna's first day, but that shouldn't be an excuse should it? 

It wasn't a negative experience, but I'll be sure to request to try a different barber if I visit again.",2018-02-07T18:29:35Z,62
122,Ace High Barber Shop,4.6,Absolutely love this place. Amazing staff and Gary was soooo good. He knows what he is doing and gave me the exact cut I wanted.

126,Ace High Barber Shop,4.6,"I wanted to try out a new place to get my haircut as I was having scheduling issues with my old place. I checked Yelp to see what was close to my work, and what had good reviews. I stumbled upon Ace High, and was drawn to being able to book online (I hate talking on the phone). Well I definitely made the right decision. My appointment was with Nick at 3:45, but it didn't get started until a little after 4, as the previous client was taking a little longer. I wasn't in a rush, so I was fine with it, especially since he apologized a couple of times. Some people won't even acknowledge that you're there waiting, so it was appreciated.

Nick was very knowledgeable about hair. I wasn't quite sure what to do, but he had suggestions, and probably gave me one of the best haircuts I've ever had. The price isn't too high, and the shampoo treatment is highly enjoyable. It's been a couple of weeks and I still love my cut. I'll definitely be back",2017-03-05T11:14:57Z,62

140,Ace High Barber Shop,4.6,"First of all, they do online booking. That already sets this place lightyears beyond most other places. Never knew I'd need this until I saved 30-45 mins sitting in queue. 

Second, I've never been to a barber shop that does hair washing before - it's literally a game changer. This prevents whatever is currently in your hair from affecting the cut itself, also washing afterwards means I don't have to plan my schedule around going home after to shower and get the loose hair out.  

The cut itself was as good as I've ever gotten from any other barber on a good day. Probably one of the better parts of me moving downtown was being within walking distance from here!",2019-06-18T21:12:24Z,62

The guy sitting outside came in and said that the girl, sitting outside, could cut my hair now. I declined as I had read reviews here that a certain female wasn't the best here. So the guy set me up with another employee, but said to come back for a set time later. I arrived right on time, nobody else waiting. The guy assigned to me was with another client but came over and acknowledged me. 20 minutes later his client got out of the chair; the barber then moved him to the hair wash area. Clearly this was going to be a while. Meanwhile another male employee finished with a client and sat in an empty barber chair and played on his phone. Sterile atmosphere, not even a magazine to read.

However, I was cut by a new hire brunette girl who didn't have enough training, I suppose. The entire experience was awful, nails are too sharp and the shampoo part was not pleasant. Next came scissors running along the scalp which hurts like hell. Then my face was covered in my own hair for about 10 min while she was doing top of my head. The worst part was the at the end when she was putting finishing touches with the metal thin brush, at that moment I thought I am visiting a dentists. Overall the experience was painful and it took waaaaaaay too long. She tried her best and provided excellent ending by wishing me amazing day. My biggest mistake was that I didn't book an appointment and just came there. With all these good reviews I am willing to come again but for a different barber.",2018-05-27T19:05:56Z,62

For the last six years since moving to BC I hopped around countless salons and barbershops looking for a barber that had the insight, skill, and consistency for my biweekly clean ups - until I was referred to Nick. I've been going to him for the last year and a bit and have left happy every single time. He's one of the rare barbers out there that truly cares about service an keeping the client happy and looking fresh.

I went in one Saturday and neither Scott nor Vicky were working so I went with Rodney. He gave me a great cut. He has many years of experience and he understands completely and very quickly what it is that you want and that's what you leave the shop with. Of equal importance is the fact that he's a really nice guy. He's super easy to talk to, kind-hearted and has a great sense of humour. I went back again the other day for another haircut with Rodney. He will now be my official go-to guy. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the barbers there but I think Rodney is the best fit for me overall. This is a great shop. Really chill vibe, nice dynamic between the barbers and really good value for the quality of work. No attitude here, just a really cool and friendly group of top-notch barbers.

My barber took the time to make sure I left looking like a million bucks. Not the cheapest haircut but it was well worth the price. My only complaint is that it says they do drop ins but when I got there I had to wait just over an hour. That's the only reason it got 4 instead of 5 stars.,2017-11-22T17:57:23Z,62

It was a Monday afternoon so the shop was not busy at all. 

Immediately greeted by Cameron (the manager) that they can see me right away. He ended up being the one cutting my hair as well. 

After finding out what I wanted done, I was given a quick wash before he got to work. 

He was very good at his job, and definitely gave me one of my favourite haircut in a very long time. He knew exactly what I wanted and the common problems I deal with given my hair type. On top of all that, he was a great conversationalist.

181,Salon Haze,4.6,"Wayne did my hair last year and did an absolute perfect job but then took my hair in a completely wrong turn. 

I asked him to get rid of the blue but he continued to put blues in my hair. Their system of confirmation doesn't work and my personal assistant had to call in to confirm an appt bc I didn't get any notice (text message) in October. 

The same thing happened and I was unable to confirm bc again I didn't get a text message. 
They still expected me to come in even though I didn't even confirm. And when I expressed frustration rightfully so, they had the audacity to blame me and said they did their due diligence when their system isn't working at all. Told me I had to be responsible for myself as a client when they're the ones who won't figure out why the confirmation system doesn't work. 

So if you want to be blamed and gaslit this is the perfect place to go! :D
They're not a serious business and only care about if you're coming or not! Even if you didn't even confirm the appt coz that's how their big brains think :) total geniuses !! 

I told them to stop contacting me therefore made it clear I was parting ways but they're petty enough and lack accountability that they had to pretend to finally be professional and contact me again thinking they could 'fire me' to save face. So if you're looking for an establishment who doesn't care what is up or down, this is the perfect place to screw up your hair. 

This is the consequence for not listening and tryna gaslight me as if we dont already live in a crazy world. Toodles and good riddance!!",2023-12-04T19:38:38Z,171

I would highly recommend seeing her for your next salon visit. She is very professional, friendly and super focused.

185,Salon Haze,4.6,"We were trying out the salon for the first time, based purely on what we had read and the reviews. My daughter and I had 2 haircut appointments with John who was really patient in consulting on our hair, the possible cut that he had in mind and took the time to explain it all before proceeding with the actual process.
He also was very patient and took time to review the cut, fine tune what he thought was out of place and despite a busy schedule showed no signs of rushing one customer for another.
Lastly but most importantly, he told us that we could call him back if we had any issues with the haircut or anything else over the next couple of days as we adjusted to the new style. There was no unnecessary up selling of any products either- so refreshing!!!
We definitely will be going back to salon haze for a John. Thank you for the experience!!",2023-06-28T01:24:35Z,171

187,Salon Haze,4.6,"This is a shoutout to Krista for her kick-ass balyage work, and her enthusiasm. In San Francisco where I live, I'd been a rut, getting my gray roots covered every 5 weeks or so, plus a glaze. I was visiting Vancouver for a couple months and needed a colorist, so I visited Krista. The first time she did a great cut and standard root coverage, as I asked. I told her I was getting bored with my hair--and was a new grandmother--and she suggested balyage as a fun way to mix it up and enjoy my hair color again. So I made the appointment for the next month. After a consult, with her really listening and thinking, she changed the tone of my hair and wound up really giving me something I love. What a treat! I really appreciated her enthusiasm and her candor. Plus, she gave me lots of styling and haircare tips. She's my go-to in Vancouver! Thanks Krista!",2022-02-26T22:49:07Z,171

189,Salon Haze,4.6,"My experience is prior to having an appointment, but I felt it is important to highlight the service level outside of the hair appointments.

I have mixed feelings about this place. I really wanted to like this place, but the messaging I have received turned me away. Apparently:
- responses via Yelp are slower than I expected
- Limited time slots for hair consultation
- Lengthy delay between hair consultation and actual hair appointment availability
- only senior stylists can turn my hair from black to titanium grey
- discount on hair colouring mentioned on Yelp only applies to junior stylists. Kind of misleading as anyone who read it would've thought it is for all services in hair colouring.

In any case, I hope this place have success. It is just my experience with this place directed me to another place that is more suitable for my needs.",2019-03-22T20:42:45Z,171

That said, the person I saw cut so little off my hair, despite me saying I was okay with having enough cut to get rid of my split ends, that I had to go elsewhere to get my ends cut again within about 6 weeks.

My cuts are really well suited to me, grow in perfectly every time, and my colour has never looked so good. I trust her implicitly. She's also a really lovely person to talk to. Very easy going, smart and funny. I also love the salon as it's a perfect mix of cool and casual. Everyone there is super nice. Alyssa is the best!!!",2019-05-26T16:05:26Z,171
195,Salon Haze,4.6,"After several bad experiences with different stylists, I decided to give this salon a try. Based on reviews I booked an appt with Loretta Tom and I must say it is worth the long wait (about a month)! I wanted to do a balayage and was looking for a specific color. Loretta took the time to discuss this with me and explaining what would happen to the color when I wash my hair 6-7 times after the coloring and what my options are. The outcome is fantastic and everyone is complementing on my color. 
They ask for a 100 dollar deposit on credit card to keep your reservation.",2016-07-15T15:57:18Z,171
196,Salon Haze,4.6,"I contemplated about writing a review for Salon Haze for the services I had received there a year ago, but I never did it because I just told myself to let this go. However, I'm speaking out today because it's been a full year since I went to them and till date my hair is still so damaged to the point that no matter how much I've trim off every month and no matter how much professional salon-grade products I've use, it is still so DAMAGED. I've come to realize that my hair will NEVER be the same as it was. Every time I look at my hair and see the state that is in for the last year, it just reminds me of the awful experiences I had here. I was assigned Cher when I called in to request a balayage service. I expressed my concerns about bleaching my Asian hair so they suggested I come in for a consultation first, which I did. Consultation with Cher went great, I explained what I wanted and she said she would take of it as she does this on a daily basis. I truly believed she understood my concerns and the results I wanted to achieve. On the day of the actual appointment, we had several things done. I had some grays showing (I am 29) so we had them touched up before the actual balayage. Fast-forwarding to the end results: it was NOT what I was expecting as the lightened color which was suppose to be a balayage started halfway down the length of my hair. It started so low that it looked like I had a dip-dye. The color she put to cover the grays were DARKER than my original hair color, so it was a bigger contrast in color to the ends. But since she curled the hair in the end, I couldn't really get to feel my hair or see exactly how the colors were placed at that moment. As we all know, colored/highlighted hair always look the best when it's curled vs straightened, so I didn't want to jump conclusion and gave it my benefit of the doubt. I also want to add that Cher also gave me a haircut, which I paid FULL PRICE for. But for full price, she basically just took her scissors and snipped off the ends of my hair so it's a straight blunt cut to remove the frizz. No actual hair-cutting skills where utilized (I can do what she did by myself at home). At that point I had some doubts, but I told myself to be optimistic and even bought the hair products that she recommended and still tipped her over $90 for her service (I paid well over $500 for the services that day). However, to my horror after my first hair wash, my hair was in-fact dipped-dyed and it did not resembled a balayage at all. I called Cher back right away and she booked me an appointment to come in. I thought she really wanted to fix it but I found myself forced to justify how my hair does not look even the slightest bit to a balayage or to the sample picture we had both agreed upon on. She even called the owner/co-owner Loretta to settle our debate. Loretta seemed unimpressed to help me either, simply saying yes, the color is lower, we can just re-dye the hair and take the color higher. Her face simply said she doesn't care, not her problem. Cher did take the color higher, but it was still no where close to our agreed vision, and she kept emphasizing how awesome I'm getting a ""free session"". Really???!!!  In the end, I lost pretty much the left side of my hair, the thickness of my hair on the left was about 1/3 of that the original because they snapped and broke off! Again, they curled it so you can't feel and compare your hair at that moment. My hair was damaged beyond repair, I could not brush my hair without hundreds of little pieces breaking off each time. Soon after that I had to chop off over 4 inches of my hair in one sitting just to try to balance the left side of my hair to the rest. Even with monthly trims for a year and professional salon products, my hair is still not the same. Never again would I ever step into that salon nor would I recommend it to anyone.",2017-09-29T22:26:32Z,171

200,Salon Haze,4.6,"Emily did a wonderful job with my hair ! She honestly was very attentive, made sure I was ok and comfortable throughout the whole appt (from about 10am - 3pm because I have really thick hair lol), reviewed what she was going to do to my hair in the very beginning of the appt, walked me through the whole process during the appt, and overall, was very engaging in what she was going to do with my hair during the whole 5hrs and she was also easy to talk to! She didn't make me feel pressured to talk to her if I just wanted to close my eyes or be on my phone. And if we were talking , it was easy-going! 

As far as how my hair looks. She achieved what I wanted and more ! My first priority was to get my greys covered up because some strands are really stubborn and no one has been able to cover up 99.9% of it but she was able to ! Second, I have thick hair so I wanted to make sure she thinned it out, but not to the point where some layers underneath my hair are really short and uneven (it's happened before)! And lastly, she was able to colour correct my hair so that for the next upcoming months, I can easily maintain it before my wedding. She did a warm balayage and made sure my roots were close to my actual roots so that when I did root touch-ups in the next few months , it wasn't so hard for me to get it touched-up. And honestly, I love my hair ! I love the colour, and how light it feels !

I'm giving it 4 stars though because they are quite on the pricier side. I did get a quote during the consultation appt, but I paid wayyy more than that at the end with taxes included. And because she recommended a certain shampoo and conditioner for me , I ended up buying it. So in all, I did pay more than what I anticipated on spending. I've never been to a salon where the hairstylist/colorist was on-point with everything I wanted done to my hair , but again, you do get what you pay for and in this case, I paid for excellent customer service and professional service.",2017-03-22T03:11:50Z,171

As you can appreciate she had important issues to deal with and completely forgot to advise the salon that she could not come in today.  There is a charge, $50+, for missed appointments and that has been applied to her credit card.  I called the salon to explain the situation and ask if they would re-consider cancelling it due to the circumstances, and I got a resounding 'no'.  And, as well, the gal I was speaking to was very rude which made the conversation rather unpleasant.  I realize that they don't make money when the client does not attend her visit but, for heaven's sake, have a bit of heart and show some goodwill towards a senior customer and her unintended failure to show up due to a medical emergency!

209,Salon Haze,4.6,"I called for a same day appointment and Emily had a cancellation. I've been holding off getting my hair cut due to bad experiences but it was ridiculously long. Emily listened to my concerns and actually cut off only what she'd indicated. 

Stylists typically give me layers but my hair has a natural wave so the top layers lift after a trim, leaving me with a mullet type cut or the layers end up not being blended after drying. I need the top layer to be long to weigh down the rest or it becomes a mess. I also hate a blunt edge and Emily gave me a texturized edge. 

Thanks!",2019-06-29T00:54:30Z,171
210,Salon Haze,4.6,"Alyssa was the one who help me from consultation till my next appointment after 6months.

I am very proud of her art. We talked about which is better to do for my hair and also what I prefer. She's also open to exchanging information in order to give great satisfaction and outstanding results that the client will ever have. She did Keratin treatment first then hair color.

Also, she's very friendly and easy to talk with.

Everyone loves my hair! Thank you Alyssa! Thank you Salon Haze",2018-07-22T22:20:21Z,171
211,Salon Haze,4.6,"Hands down the BEST salon in Vancouver. 

Trust me. It took 6 years of living in this city, enduring bad untrained stylists to finally find this gem of a salon. Once again, my fellow Yelpers came through. Based on all the raving reviews, I decided to take a chance at this place before giving up on getting my hair done in Vancouver altogether.

As soon as you enter the space, you feel welcome. Even when stylists are busy, they still acknowledge you. They politely excuse themselves from their clients to make sure you are taken care of. Appointments ALWAYS start on time too so you know they have their sh*t together. There is an air of comfort and confidence here and I can see why. The stylists are ALL trained, with years of experience and as a result, all the clients feel incredibly comfortable sitting back and relaxing. I love that the studio is not pretentious at all, but still cozy, modern and classy. How many ""high end"" studios have you been to with chandeliers, posters of models and shelves of hair products yet you leave spending a fortune with bad results. No need for anything fancy here anyways because the work of the staff speaks for itself and their results are what brings the salon to life.

I've been seeing Tannis for just over a year now and have never been so satisfied with my hair. She not only takes the time to get to know her clients but she is SO talented when it comes to cutting, colouring and styling hair. She goes above and beyond to make sure you feel comfortable with either small or drastic changes to your hair and always gives sound advice.  When I needed a summer ""makeover"" for my long, dark hair, I called to make an appointment with her but was told she wasn't available for another 2.5 weeks. Although I was eager to make some changes to my hair asap, I decided to wait it out and stick with Tannis to take care of me. Well, it was well WORTH the wait! I can see why they get booked solid for appointments with NO cancellations - they are so good at what they do.

I have received so many compliments on my hair since Tannis worked her magic on it last Saturday! The balayage and toning results are stunning - I have never seen my hair with this much life after a colour treatment. The work they do is so unique, even strangers will come up to ask where I got my colour done because it is SO stunning compared to the kind of brassy highlights you see on other people. I highly recommend this salon to all who are reading this because everyone deserves to feel as beautiful and confident as I did after my appointment! Don't be discouraged if there's a wait to get an appointment, it is SO worth it.",2016-07-18T21:27:40Z,171
212,Salon Haze,4.6,"Alyssa is awesome, very easy going, has great suggestions and actually listens to what you want. You can see her lovely work on her IG. All the staff are friendly.

213,Salon Haze,4.6,"Amazin service top of the line by far the best neck /scalp massage during the shampoo that I have ever had I just wanted to melt and super comfy shampooing loungers 

I had a full set of highlights and a bad amount of warmth because of me previously being a darker colour Raquel made my hair look better than I have ever had it totally colour corrected added depth and dimensions and convinced me to cut off my dead hair wish made my hair feel softer and better than ever

215,Salon Haze,4.6,I had a cut and balayage with Daemon and I absolutely love it. He squeezed me in where he had a cancellation as I came from out of town. He took so much time to figure out exactly what I wanted as well as gave recommendations for what he thought would look best for my hair type. I'm so happy with my hair!,2021-07-18T19:14:41Z,171
216,Salon Haze,4.6,I just moved to Vancouver from NYC and needed color and keratin. I saw the positive reviews and now I'm adding mine. Honestly this is the best hair salon I have been to. Damon my stylist was such a perfectionist and so knowledgeable about hair; he is a real professional. I also had a consultation and two appointments to get it all done and the other stylists are also great. you can tell everyone here is the best at their game. Cannot recommend enough.,2021-05-01T02:36:04Z,171
217,Salon Haze,4.6,"Pros: 
I rarely review places after one try, but salon haze really lived up to its prestige with how amazing their skills and services are! Loretta is the coowner and she is so passionate about hair styling. She is skillful and has won multiple awards. She consulted me about the ways to get to my goal in the healthiest way possible and she also caters to my wants my needs. She's outgoing and really made the long process of cutting and dying my hair felt somewhat more enjoyable. I wanted balayage with a slight trim, and she gave me just that! She also took the time to teach me how to curl my hair. They really travel the extra mile to satisfy their customers. 

Cons: Its on the pricier side( ~300 for due job) but definitely worth the experience if you want a guaranteed amazing experience.",2018-04-04T00:20:21Z,171
218,Salon Haze,4.6,"Love, love, love this salon!! Fabulous people and a great atmosphere.
So thrilled to have found Cher, best color l have ever had, hands down. She really knows her stuff and is very professional, knowledgeable and talented.

219,Salon Haze,4.6,"I really wanted to like this salon. In fact, I live in CA and made an appointment based on the Yelp reviews. I drove all the way from West Vancouver for a haircut. The haircut took 10 minutes... the stylist seemed completely disinterested and I didn't walk out feeling like my hair looked good. Very disappointed. Be sure to read reviews and only go to the stylists who are called out in the positive reviews. I don't think it's the salon, it's the indivisible stylists.",2019-12-28T20:57:47Z,171
220,Salon Haze,4.6,"Wayne is fantastic!! Hes very easy to communicate with and does everything in his ability to get you the exact haircut you want. Along the way, he provides suggestions on how to make the haircut better match with your head shape/hair texture. He even walked me through how to style my hair!

Not only that... he provides the best head massages!!!! 

Would definitely recommend seeing Wayne if going to Salon Haze!",2019-08-27T16:54:31Z,171

222,Salon Haze,4.6,"I really love it here. When I first came in during spring of 2017, my hair was brown with red/copper tones at the ends and I wanted to go blonde. It's really hard to get red out of hair (especially to blonde) but somehow Alyssa managed to do it and did an amazing job. I ended up with a gorgeous blonde balayage, and I went back in December to get my Balayage retouched, and even after like 8 or 9 months my hair still looked amazing. It is pretty pricey, but it's completely worth it, and keep in mind I was doing a major hair color change and my hair is super long. If you want something done to an amazing quality, chances are it'll be towards the expensive side.

Alyssa is honestly a hair magician, my hair was still in great shape after both of the balayages, and I've been loving my hair ever since. Genuinely if you want somewhere awesome to get your hair done, I really suggest Salon Haze. Definitely have Alyssa do your hair!",2018-01-01T23:16:47Z,171
223,Salon Haze,4.6,They ruined my hair! My hair grow really slowly.  It would take 2 years to grow back to the same length!  Like what? What do you want me to do?  Wear wigs for the next 2 years during socials like a female pervert??  You would need 2 more years doing nothing to finally recover from their damage!,2019-04-29T04:41:19Z,171
224,Salon Haze,4.6,"I'm so happy I came here to see Alyssa. She has such a wonderful and friendly personality! I came in to have my brassy, uneven hair fixed that was previously colored by a different salon (see my previous reviews).

Right when I came in, Alyssa greeted me while she was finishing up with a different client (I arrived a few minutes early). When she was done, she offered me something to drink while she promptly cleans up her station. Since it was quite a long, early commute for me, I asked for coffee. It turns out they had ran out of milk, so she quickly notified me and took initiative. Next thing I knew, she was out the door to buy some milk from the store. She was very swift and came back right away that I barely noticed the wait. I greatly appreciate her efforts in doing that, and it just shows how much she values her clients. The coffee was delightful by the way.

Alyssa explained in great detail what she plans on doing to fix my hair color and even demonstrated beforehand what techniques she would use so I can better understand the process. I really appreciated the fact that she went over everything even though we have already spoken previously during a complimentary consultation. Surprisingly, there wasn't that much needed to be done to my hair, in terms of dyeing, which was a huge relief because I don't want any more hair damage.

I felt very welcome and comfortable during my session thanks to my friendly stylist. Our conversations never felt forced or awkward. It was just like chatting with a friend which was great.

The salon was very clean and professional. What I like about it is that it's not too big and not at all cramped either. It feels more personal and relaxing compared to bigger salons with 20 chairs in my opinion.

As for my new hair color, I love it! I couldn't stop looking at the mirror when she was done with it. I noticed that she really paid attention to small details such as making sure that my roots are even on both sides. She also watched my hair closely to make sure the color turns out right and doesn't go overboard.

I will definitely be coming back and I do highly recommend this place.",2015-08-02T23:37:18Z,171
225,Salon Haze,4.6,"I want to say what an amazing job they did on my hair. Wayne and Loretta, you outdone yourself!
I came in with harsh contrasting ombre blond and brown and they were able to transform my hair to full head of ashy brown blended highlights. You would never know I had the blond ombre from before. They took the time to watch the color and made sure everything was perfect and still keep the quality of my hair. Highly recommend this place!",2017-09-01T17:47:10Z,171

She took the time to find out what I wanted and what my concerns were and then proceeded to do an incredible colour job while minimizing the impact to my head and hair.

I have long hair with balayage so this time I decided to go back to short hair and get rid of the bleached parts.  Wayne sat me down and listened to my request, gave me some advice and got it started.  He did a phenomenal job in less than an hour, and I have Thick hair.  He layered it, curled it upon my request, and dang it looks so good!!  It's a very positive experience and although the price is a teeny bit higher than other salons, it's completely worth it.

Daemen asked me what I wanted to do with my hair, asked me if I style it everyday and how much time I want to put in to it on a daily basis. and then took a good 5 minutes quietly playing with my hair and watching it react - I assume he was trying to get the natural feel of it.

Alyssa was so good, very friendly and easy to talk to, I felt she actually listened to what i wanted and that she knew her craft.
She was constantly checking my hair and making sure everything was going well. She used OlaPlex treatment to help lift my hair and at no point was my head of fire or anything like that.
Not cheap but my hair is still healthy and it's blonde.
They offer coffee, tea, water and granola bars. A nice 20% off from your first color.",2017-02-01T17:39:24Z,171
235,Salon Haze,4.6,"This place is AMAZING. 
I moved to Vancouver in 2016, and was nervous about letting a new hair stylist touch my hair as I have long, thick, coarse hair. I have been traumatized in the past by horrific cuts, and bad colour jobs. I did some research and read about Cher at Salon Haze. I have naturally dark brown hair, but have been colouring my hair red for several years. When I came to Cher, my hair had faded to an orange copper colour that did me no favours. I had heard she was an expert in blonde hair, but turns out she is an expert in dark hair too. Cher took my hair from dull and damaged, to bright & luscious. My hair maintains its bright, red colour between visits, and is the shiniest it's ever been. Cher understands the coarse texture of my hair and has used fusio treatments on my hair to help minimize frizz, and recommended different masques that help with moisture. Cher listens to feedback on my cuts, and leaves you feeling fabulous. I have never gotten more compliments on my hair, than I have since going to Cher. 

I also have to comment on the wonderful team that works there. On many occasions I have asked for the opinion of Emily, Raquel, Tanis, or Loretta and they are always so friendly, kind and a lot of fun. If you are looking for a place to take your hair to the next level, then this is it. I will be a lifelong customer. LOVE IT THERE.",2018-03-05T02:50:18Z,171
236,Salon Haze,4.6,"Update: Thanks to the management and a senior stylist, the bleaching issue was fixed and I'm happy with the final result. 

Service was average and the colour turned out to be no where close to my reference picture. Mostly disappointed because of the patchy bleach...",2017-09-11T05:16:59Z,171
237,Salon Haze,4.6,"I needed to start the journey of colour correcting from very dark brown (box colour) back to my natural light blonde. I had been to another salon before where the stylist left me with chemical burns on my scalp from bleaching my virgin roots and leaving my head in the sink with bleach on for over an hour. I wanted to make sure I had a stylist who would be honest with me and patient with the process and who also wouldn't put my scalp through what it had been through after my first attempt at colour correction. 

It's now been nearly a year and I am definitely back to blonde with my hair in pretty decent condition thanks to Tanis. It hasn't been cheap, and it's taken a really long time, but I can honestly say after all the research I did I'm incredibly happy I made the decision to go to Salon Haze and that Tanis was the one to tackle my hair. I have appreciated the honesty and hard work that Tanis has put in on getting my hair back to blonde. From the many hours I've spent at Salon Haze I can say I've been impressed with every single stylist and their dedication to their clients. Tanis already knows how much I appreciate her and the many, many hours we've spent on my hair. 

If you're looking for honest, dedicated stylists Salon Haze should be your first choice.",2017-05-05T20:29:56Z,171

I had to wait 10 days for a 5-minute consultation and was told I couldn't be scheduled for an appointment for another 5 weeks, despite that I had an open and flexible schedule. The stylist also did not discuss with me the price and I was shocked to find out that my balayage  and cut would come to $400 even after a first-time customer discount. I don't know if the company sets their price range in yelp, but  I was misled to think this place was more affordable.",2018-04-14T04:07:47Z,171

Cher is absolutely wonderful. I have been getting my hair done in London, New York & Toronto for the past few years so I was nervous about finding someone amazing here. My balayage & tape in extensions are my favourite set I've gotten thus far! 

Not to mention the salon has a convenient location on W Broadway, she has the cutest little puppy you can snuggle as much as you want as she beautifies you, and also she is extremely value worthy. :)

Tim took my 1980s granny bob to new heights.  Working with my barely there natural wave, he blew dry my hair using only his hands, twirling and pressing curls into shape.  Then he touched up a few pieces with his curling iron, and finished with a generous amount of hair spray.  

The feeling at Haze and from Tim is spontaneous, artistic and wild fun within the framework of precision and technical wizardry.",2016-06-18T23:11:13Z,171
241,Salon Haze,4.6,"I did a Google search for ""Olaplex Vancouver"" and this salon came up as one of the highest ranking on the search engine. Reading the other Yelp reviews helped in my decision to give these guys a try. I've been doing a lot of research on Olaplex and decided to get a treatment here. My regular hair dresser doesn't offer the service hence why I had to come here. I was a bit nervous going in.

I sent them an e-mail and gave them some background on my situation. 

I did some additional research on the salon and appreciated that they not only gave a detailed outline of the service that they offered but also gave a profile of each of their stylists which made me feel more comfortable using them. 

This review took about two months to formulate as I wanted to make sure that I had all my basis covered.

I came in for an initial consultation on January to check the condition of my hair and address my concerns about my hair loss. My hair wasn't ready yet for the treatment, therefore, I came back 4 weeks later for another consultation. 

Both consultations were free and took 10 minutes each. I appreciated the honesty and professionalism during both consultations. He read my mind when he said, ""I know your roots are bothering you.""

I came in a month later to have my roots bleached out by the two owners at the same time. They were double tagging to get the bleach on evenly. It was neat watching and being fussed over by two people.

They were very methodical in application which I haven't received elsewhere by applying one volume away from the roots and then finishing the roots with another to ensure that it remained as healthy as possible. 

They also toned my hair which is a something I've never had offered to me before. My hair took on a cool grey color.

On the pricey side but very professional and you do get what you pay for.",2016-03-15T20:57:08Z,171
242,Salon Haze,4.6,"I feel so privileged that my locks are coiffed by a multi-award-winning hairstylist at Salon Haze. 

Tim has reigned supreme at various national and international competitions and most recently he took home the BC Hairstylist of the year 2013 award.  He takes the helm at this newly-opened Kitstlano Salon and is supported by Loretta, the equally talented, industry-recognized hairstylist.

Upon walking into Salon Haze you are warmly greeted and will be offered coffee/tea/water.  While you wait for your appointment you can admire the minimalist, chic design that Tim and Loretta has pulled together themselves. 

When it was my turn for my hair cut, Tim took the time to really understand the profile of my hair, my usual style, and my expectations.  He was very gracious to share tips on how to keep my damaged hair healthy and tricks of how to style my hair. He also recommended products in the most informative manner. 

I felt like I was the artwork of his creation and I can feel his passion for his work. If by now you are wondering what the heck does it cost to get a haircut there.  For women is is $60+ and for men it is $40+ which are VERY reasonable compared to Suki's and quite a steal considering you are getting a DESIGNER cut with such exceptional service. 

I am a big fan for local talents and thus I applaud Tim and Loretta for taking the plunge into the intimidating world of entrepreneurship, but their passion will help them navigate and their talents will pull through. 

Big CHEERS!",2013-08-30T07:36:24Z,171

Beautiful white open space, I've been going to the salon for a few years now and it's amazing to see it grow more and more each time I go. I love the busy yet friendly atmosphere and every stylist is willing to help grab you coffee or water or magazines even though you're not seeing them personally.

Tanis is my stylist. I've seen other staff because she is extremely busy but if you can prebook it is so worth it.  She is funny and easy to talk to and I always enjoy our conversation.  Being as booked as she is its amazing  that she can remember things that I told her our previous appointment but she does! And her talent trumps her amazing people skills, her cuts and colours are amazing!  I would say her style is more laid back which is great for Vancouver, she makes my hair not only amazing to style but also still looks amazing even if I just wash and wear!",2017-09-19T16:42:24Z,171

Initially I wanted Tim to cut my hair but he was so booked I went with Alyssa instead and she did not disappoint at all!  She did not over cut and just the perfect amount of layers without looking too overdone but enough to thicken my hair. Easy to talk to and really took her time with the cutting. Receptionist was also really nice and accommodating. Will return for sure.,2019-01-20T18:43:48Z,171

After several emails back and forth to between the salon and myself to book the stylist of my choice we finally found a date and time that would work for the stylist and myself. I was sent an email asking for my credit card info to secure my time slot. I had completely forgotten to call them back within 24 hrs and my time slot was given away to someone else. No follow up phone calls no reminder emails just given away to someone else. Ironically and email was sent advising me that the agreed upon time slot was no longer available because i had not secured it with a credit card. Well l, wouldn't it have been nice to send a reminder email instead of an email advising that the time slot has been given away. Pretty poor customer service from whomever is in charge of emails.

I felt so glamorous, I made an effort to go out for dinner that evening.  What makes this salon different from others is the attention to detail.  The male client next to me had a full hour service for his cut.  The stylists are all passionate - not trying to rush to their next client.   I highly recommend this salon for a deluxe experience.",2015-11-15T07:17:57Z,171

249,Salon Haze,4.6,"I told Tim Kuo, who's the co-owner and won many awards that I wanted to go short so he chopped off my ponytail and he took care of the rest... I love my new hair! I'd recommend them to anyone looking to get their hair done. 

Throughout the process, Tim taught me a lot about my hair and answered all my hair questions I've always wondered about. List of Q&A is in my blog post: http://ow.ly/sNVr4

I was amazed from watching Tim's technique when he was cutting my hair. I felt like I was watching a bartender doing bottle tricks as Tim has his scissors and comb flipping through his fingers after each snip - back and forth, back and forth. He was meticulous, he would check, double check and triple check the length of each strand.

He took his time, asking if I liked the length of my bangs twice and even after we were done the haircut, he decided the bangs might bother my eyes and went back to cut some more. So even after I said it looked good, he didn't just move on and leave it at that - he wanted to make sure it was absolutely perfect!

My hair turned out awesome and I love how blunt and modern the ends are. Makes my hair feel so much fuller and healthier. I also think this look makes me look more grown up! 

The space at Salon Haze was simplistic, modern, and upscale. They carry a lot of different salon exclusive products on the wall, right when you walk in and offer granola bars in the waiting area! This was one of the best hair experience I've had and I would definitely recommend!

250,Salon Haze,4.6,"**Update**
The same day I left my last review, Tim called me asking if I could come in so he could personally see to it that I get the cut I wanted. I was very impressed that he even reached out to me let alone offer to fix it! 

I went back and Tim was so great about making sure I was taken care of even though it was quite busy. There was no awkwardness about my previous review and he took his time while giving me updates along the way about what he was doing. Much appreciated! 

Most importantly, I LOVE my cut now! Love it enough to write this literally moments after leaving :P I left feeling that, although mishaps happen, this place definitely takes care of its clients and they don't hesitate to make things right.",2017-04-16T19:42:23Z,171
251,Salon Haze,4.6,"This is my third time lucky salon in Vancouver! Went today to get a haircut from Alyssa who is super nice and friendly. I arrived at 12 for my appointment and didn't have to wait at all. Alyssa brought me some coffee straight away and gave me a lovely head massage at their bed-like sinks - talk about pampered! 
I've super thick hair and usually hairdressers never take enough weight out of it. Alyssa gave me a fab cut and I think I'm finally happy that all the weight has been taken out of it. Left the salon with a hella lighter head than when i went in, will def be going back :)",2016-01-02T22:16:39Z,171

254,Salon Haze,4.6,"I came in for a haircut and blow out, which looked great. My stylist (Emily) did an amazing job of my hair and was lovely to talk to. However, the receptionist was quite rude and unpleasant. She tossed the pen for me to sign my receipt, and cut me off whenever I spoke. I would definitely come back for a high quality hair cut but did not enjoy the receptionist's attitude.",2019-11-04T01:35:49Z,171
255,Salon Haze,4.6,"I'm honestly shocked that this place has so many good reviews. I do feel a bit guilty giving this place only 1 star as I've never actually had my hair cut here... but as 0 was not an option, there you have it.

It took over a week to book an appt in here, which should have been my first clue. I arrived about 5 minutes early for my appointment, checked in at the front and was asked to have a seat for a few minutes while the hair dresser finished up.

So I sat. And sat. And sat. Nobody came to offer me water (which I would expect from a higher end salon), nobody came to apologize for the wait or tell me he was running behind, nothing. I sat there for almost 40 minutes waiting for my appt. I finally got up and left. Really unimpressed with the service. Not sure if it was just the people working that day or what, but I certainly won't be back.",2017-03-13T05:11:46Z,171
256,Salon Haze,4.6,"First time here and I loved it!!! Been to other place for 2 years and decided to get new stylist, salon Haze was my second choice. I wish I could have found this place sooner! I called for last minute appointment and Daemen is the only one available on last minute appointment. I just asked him to cut it whichever he thinks better and suited my face but not too short. He is soooo patience and helpful. I really loved the result and a lot of people complimented my hair. Go for Daemen!!! He is absolutely amazing and he really loved what he do (: 100% satisfaction guarantee!!!",2018-09-14T05:23:10Z,171
257,Salon Haze,4.6,"Although I found my stylist's technique a bit unorthodox, I was happy enough with the result. However I found the overall experience lacking in the personal touch. No introductions, zero small talk (I don't need much, but zero's not enough), and very little consultation about the cut. I'm not good at expressing myself when it comes to hair, so I really need the stylist to take the lead and show their passion for the craft.",2017-03-06T19:54:32Z,171
258,Salon Haze,4.6,"This salon is the best! I have been going here for over a year now and it's always been an amazing experience. All of the staff is friendly and Cher always knows how to interpret what I want and executes exactly what I ask for. Sometimes if I don't know exactly what I ask for, she'll make suggestions and show me pictures before starting so we are on the same page for the finished result. If you're a blonde or want to be one, you need to get your hair done by Cher!",2018-07-16T22:02:19Z,171
259,Salon Haze,4.6,"Raquel did an AMAZING job on my hair today! My hair's been missing some serious TLC and I couldn't be more impressed with her cut and styling. I'm not big into high-maintenance styles, so I essentially told her my length preference and asked her to do what she thought would work... no regrets at all, she nailed it!! Another plus about Salon Haze is the incredibly fair pricing! I've just moved to Vancouver and can thankfully say that I won't be needing to look any further for a great salon :)",2017-09-20T23:53:33Z,171

The staff are very friendly and very informative, they will take the time and talk with you to figure out what you want if you didn't have anything in mind. Their consultation is very thorough as well.

At first, I've been going here to touch up my roots to dye it brown. Last Summer, I decided to wanted to go pink, I was definitely stepping out of my comfort zone. Because I didn't want to dye my whole head pink, we both decided to do a balayage ombre effect. Loretta was super patient with my hair and took good care of it. The end result was beautiful! I loved it so much~ When you google Salon Haze, the pink balayage ombre hair you will see is mine :D

Right now I'm getting my silver balayage ombre retouched by Loretta and the end result is always beautiful!",2015-11-05T01:12:15Z,171

264,Salon Haze,4.6,"Loretta's amazing at what she does. I had brown hair with highlights but wanted to go blonde for the summer, so I booked an appointment with Loretta and had a warm blonde balayage done in March and it STILL looks so good grown out.

When I went for my appointment, I ended up studying the entire time (5 hours, omg) since it was right in the middle of my midterms. She was super nice about it too, even offering to pick up food for me while I was there.

At the end of my session, my hair turned out much ashier than I originally wanted. Loretta assured me that it would fade to the warmer blonde that I wanted after a week, and of course she was right :)

Go to her for all your balayage needs! So worth.",2016-10-20T05:39:32Z,171
265,Salon Haze,4.6,"I went in to get my very first balayage done, and Wayne did an AMAZING job! 
It was my first time getting my hair bleached and Wayne took some time to explain why and how my hair is going to be trimmed&colored. I had soooo much hair to begin with and my natural color is super dark, but Wayne was extremely patient and nice, made me feel comfortable and happy for the whole time I was there :) Other staffs there are also very friendly and nice, the atmosphere there is friendly and clean.

Overall, very friendly staff and clean environment. Highly recommend!",2017-11-15T01:24:58Z,171

I called the salon and they said I'd have to wait more than a month but it would be so worth it! And I am so happy I did! She is amazing! She saw me before hand for a consultation and when the day came she put a lot of time and effort! I must say she really knows her stuff! She explained to me how I should be taking care of my new color and also she was so kind! When I told her I was a bit cold she brought me a blanket. I definitely recommend her to anyone who's in search of a great colorist!,2017-05-04T23:53:36Z,171

Cher did a fantastic job cutting my bangs and was super patient with my three-year old daughter who had tagged along with me (my daughter loved her complimentary granola bar!).  Cher's customer service skills are fantastic;  I was so appreciative when she went above and beyond for me, especially considering that I was a drop-in client.  I have already recommended this place to my friends!  Thanks again, Cher!",2017-02-12T23:05:34Z,171

274,Salon Haze,4.6,"Just wasn't spectacular.  Nothing personal but I just didn't think my haircut was fantastic.  Felt like I needed another hair cut within a month due to split ends and lack of shape (I have long hair and usually get hair cuts every 4-6 months). The cut was more on the wispy, thin side reminiscent of the haircuts I got when my mom took me to Crystal mall as a teen. Sorry Tim. I'm sure I just got unlucky. 

They recommended a really good shampoo and conditioner called label M which I am sticking with.  However I've been purchasing it online because it's almost half the price.",2014-04-30T22:20:23Z,171

276,Salon Haze,4.6,I found salon haze through yelp. I was in vancouver for my best friends 30th birthday and needed my hair done badly. Did some research on the salon and decided to go with Loretta. I was really happy with my balayage and I thought the price was fair in comparison to what I usually pay at my  salon in la. The staff was friendly and the shop was clean and tastefully decorated.

She was very attentive and I was very happy with the results. The service was great too the moment I got in I was offered coffee / tea. It's not your typical big salon but it has its charm. Will definitely come back again next time I stop by vancouver. For sure one of my favorite cuts.,2017-07-30T03:43:39Z,171

281,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"I always have a great experience at Hive. I generally give them an idea of what I'm looking for, and then allow them to use their knowledge and expertise to refine the vision. And they always deliver; I've gotten my best cuts from here. 

Went to the Broadway location a few months ago and got a cut with Asami, who did amazingly with a textured cut. Today I went to the Oak location for the first time since it was closer and got a haircut with Jun. Although I didn't know exactly what I was envisioning, Jun got it right away and after a quick discussion, gave me the best short cut I've ever gotten. The customer service was very friendly and kind as well. I love how knowledgeable the staff is in giving tips on how to take care of your hair or how to style the cut they've given you. 

I've been coming here for the past few years and I've referred a lot of people who have always enjoyed their cuts here as well. I will continue to come again!",2020-11-24T02:28:51Z,207

283,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"BEST SHAMPOOING EVER!  Coming from Connecticut, USA, I made an appointment after seeing Hive on Yelp. The gentleman, Jun, who called me was very pleasant and did his best to schedule appointments for my friend and me. My stylist, Lisa, was very friendly and thorough. Lisa washed and conditioned my hair (I have very thick hair and a lot of it) while massaging my scalp and neck. She even put a warm towel on the back of my neck where I was leaning on the sink. She then used a curling iron to put a lil' curl on the ends...All this for only $28-I was shocked-at home this would be at least double without the massage and curling iron! I was very impressed and happy with Lisa and Hive Salon! I wish they were in Connecticut!!",2023-08-04T21:17:05Z,207
284,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"I usually don't leave reviews on Yelp, but this has to be done.

I went to Hive Hair Spa to get my hair bleached and fixed (it was a peachy colour that I wanted to get rid of.) But the end result was completely different than what I had asked for. I specifically wanted my hair to be dyed a blonde balayage, so that I could colour on top of it. But my hair stylist, Sayuri, thought I was joking when I wanted to dye it pink again.

The first time my hair was bleached and toned, it turned out to be a dark blue/brown colour after the toner. I wasn't too worried about the blue, since I have toned my hair before with Wella T14 and I knew it would fade. She mentioned that after washing it with purple shampoo for two weeks, my hair would fade to an ash blonde. But after a MONTH of washing my hair WITH non-sulfate free shampoo to strip the colour, my hair was still a light brown, and the blue had faded to a silver. This was definitely not the colour I had asked for.

So I called the salon and spoke with the manager, and he was kind enough to offer me a hair fix as a refund. I went back and asked for the exact same thing, thinking that this would fix the issue. But my hair was once again, NOT the colour I had asked for. My hair turned out to be a shade of brown again, and she mentioned that she had added extra toner so that the colour would last longer. But that was not what I had asked for whatsoever. 
I had agreed to pay for toner since the bleach was on them. But when I was handed the bill, the toner was $90 for long hair. She had not communicated to me the price at all, and I was shocked that she would charge me service on top of the price of the toner, when she had made the mistake on my hair in the first place! 

Needless to say that after TWO salon visits, my hair was still not the colour that I had asked for despite two bleach sessions. And she mentioned that, ""It will lighten to ash blonde, trust me."" Btw, that photo was taken a month after my second appointment. 

What I've learned is that language barrier goes a long way. Her native language is Japanese, and it was hard communicating with her in English, and some of the miscommunication must have happened there. But I am also pretty blown away that she was able to screw up my hair not once, but twice. And still charge me for the toning service she actively did not speak of. 

Avoid this salon location for hair bleaching at all costs!! And make sure you take into account the language barrier before you carefully select the hair stylist you work with. Learn from my mistakes please :)",2022-01-19T09:23:16Z,207
285,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"Quite possibly the worst haircut I've received. Was supposed to be a shag but instead I got 2 disconnected haircuts that looks like I have a separate bob with long lengths.  I asked for a colour and my hair was much more damaged at the end of it all.  I tipped but regretted it as after I paid, Jun held the door open for me and didn't even allow me time to get my coat on.  He must've stood there, not looking at me, dying for me to leave.  I felt so unwelcome.  I was there for 2 hours and didn't even get a drink of water. THIS PLACE HAS GONE SO DOWNHILL.  Even the ceiling is falling apart.  I sure miss Asame on Broadway, I used to go there all the time but now she's gone. Now, it's really sad.",2023-04-02T17:21:19Z,207

I called yesterday and was able to get an appointment with Jun.  I arrived and was greeted promptly.   I was offered a drink immediately.   Talk about a pleasant experience. The drink is complimentary and they also give you Pocky sticks.    I got a hair wash and scalp massage before the cut and blow dry.   Jun was very friendly and the whole experience was very pleasant.   
You get 20% off your first cut which is an added bonus.   I think this will be my new salon.",2019-02-07T02:33:46Z,207
287,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"I've been going to Hive for many years for various hair services (cut, colour, highlight, etc). Although I used to enjoy their services, lately I've found that the quality has gone downhill.  

Today, I went for my hair colour appointment and showed the stylist a reference picture of what I was looking for. I also explained that I wanted ash blonde highlights. After sitting there for 4 hours, the end result looked like a solid brown colour. Yes, there were highlights, but they were so dark that they blended in with the base colour. It also did not look anything like the picture that I provided! When I asked the stylist, all she said was ""don't worry it will get lighter"". 

After explaining a few more times that this is not what I wanted, she finally relented and offered to add some additional highlights to my hair. The after picture shows the end result of this ""fix"". While the hair does look better after fixing it, there is still a comparable difference between the picture provided. 

My stylist in particular also made the experience very mediocre unpleasant. She handled my hair very roughly, especially when washing and drying my hair. On multiple occasions, she even pulled out some of my hair while brushing it out with her fingers. She was also not very careful when applying the hair dye and splashed the dye on my hand and phone multiple times.

All in all, this will be my last time going to Hive.",2019-11-24T04:23:07Z,207
288,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"I am not one who enjoys going to the hair salon but boy did I have a relaxing appointment today. Booked with Jun (""joon"") from all the great reviews. 
A ladies' haircut with wash and style is $38 + tax, which is beyond fair.  My visit was 1.5 hours but it felt much shorter.
Stall parking outside (~15 spots for the entire plaza), it's free!

They serve you a nice cold/hot beverage of your choice along with Pocky sticks. The washing area is amazing. You start by sitting upright then you get your feet lifted and your back reclined into the sink, plus they cover your eyes so you can enjoy the wash and massage. It was so nice! Then I got a brief scalp and shoulder massage! The cut was what I wanted, I like how Jun respected my silence and didn't force any conversation. All in all, would go back and am actually looking forward to my next visit.

Please note that Jun does see multiple clients at the same time, i.e. when the staff washes your hair, he may be cutting someone else's hair. But you will still feel cared for,  and it was quite efficient for different people to step in.

289,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,Maybe there was a communication issue. I had a straight cut and did not want any texturizing. Asked for 2 inch trim-MAX.

I hate myself with this length of hair. I made sure that the lady knew specifically how I wanted it cut because other hairdressers have made the same mistake and have cut it too short. Yet, she still cut way too short. Im very disappointed, I've heard tons of great reviews from friends and family but I'm not in one bit satisfied.",2023-03-11T04:43:51Z,207

302,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"A nice accidental discovery this week.  I have been driving by this hair salon for years, and have even visited the SB next door many times, but had never thought much about trying this place until I read its reviews on Yelp! 

Upon entry, it may not seem like a fancy trendy salon, but once you take a moment to soak in the environment, you'll see that they are a differentiator.  

Being Japanese run, the greeting is a friendly, courteous, and warm.  You will sit in a sofa chair - yes, not one of those barber shop revolving chairs.   It might be hard on the hair stylist's back but great for me. 

Then yes, there is the comp coffee or tea along with Pocky that many others wrote about there (along with photos).  

My Fukuoka-born stylist took his time, and in total, probably spent about 45 minutes on me.  And yes, it finished with a Japanese scalp and shoulder massage, which I like very much.",2017-07-07T18:32:44Z,207
303,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"I'm a picky person in choosing my hair salon and am glad that I have stumbled upon this Japanese hair salon near my house.  The price is very affordable yet the service is at good standard. 
Staffs are friendly and the salon is clean. Don't hesitate to bring a picture of how your hair wanna be cut.  Please do make your hair appointment well ahead of time to avoid disappointment. Heads up! Punctuality is the key to visit a Japanese hair salon as to respect this beautiful culture.  All hairdressers there do have their own style and it's only a matter of personal preference. Try them all out to tell whom you like to stick to. Good luck! Thumbs up to Hive!",2019-10-19T14:54:23Z,207
304,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"Went there on Monday for a perm / cut and treatment. My first time so they assigned me Masa.  I didn't have a good result.

After washing my hair the second day, I find the perm looks very messy (curls are inconsistent). 

The cut was bad, it's not balanced in the front, one side is longer and the other side shorter. 

My hair is very dry and frizzy even after the hair treatment..... I suspect the chemical is not good.  Even the perm process only took about 20mins in total, just leaving the chemical in for 5 minutes each time for 3 times.
The treatment... was left on hair for only a few minutes, what kind of treatment is that?
My friend got a haircut and coloured her hair, but her cut is much better.  But she also finds her hair was damaged after the chemical.
After speaking to a third friend, she also been to Hive for straightening perm, and she also had bad experience.

Even they serve you Pocky and tea, and they gave us 20% off, I will not go back.  Can't really communicate with the stylist and had a really bad experience.  Worst perm I've ever got.  My friends asked me to go back to get it fixed, but I don't trust them now. ~,~

I wish I had left it longer so I can get it fixed at another salon.  No, I'm just gonna tie my hair up all summer.  Wasted my $112.",2018-07-20T01:25:00Z,207

He knows exactly what he's doing to make your hair feel light and natural without leaving any awkward bits. One thing I love about Hive is that their customer service is amazing. They also provide you with some snacks and free beverages.

However, one thing that they can improve on is communication! It's taken me many tries to call and actually make an appointment because no one seems to be picking up the calls. I've checked to call within salon hours, avoid days off, holidays etc. I'm still giving them a 5 star!",2019-06-11T19:15:01Z,207

The lady that did my hair, didn't catch her name, did a phenomenal job! The scalp and shoulder massages were also much appreciated. I would not hesitate to recommend this salon to anybody who is looking for a salon or even a new stylist. Bonus is that there is also parking!

Relaxing environment.  I'm completely satisfied!!

We always ask for Jun when we are here, since he is the most experienced hairstylist there.  He also recognizes us by name, which we really appreciate.  There were a few times when I thought the hair cut was not the greatest because it was cut quickly, and I still had split ends at the end, but the last hair cut I had was great.  It is hard to find someone you can trust to cut your hair, but I do trust them to cut it. 

It also helps that they give you pocky and tea while you are waiting and a mini head massage. So nice!",2017-12-12T18:22:26Z,207

My stylist is Jun. Surprisingly, he ""serviced two or more customers at the same time"". I told him that I need more trimming on my left side of hair and he did the second-time trimming but the lengths of my two sides of hair are still not the same. He even didn't get time to say ""thank you"" when he was done with my trimming. I can see he was rushing to service another customer beside me. When checking out, I used their Facebook promotion but he looked unhappy about this. I came here is because I like Japanese service but the service here is getting worse compared to 3 years ago.",2019-10-17T17:34:09Z,207

316,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"I came for a root touch up ($60) and hair cut ($38). The service was friendly and I was offered a selection of drinks (I chose barley tea) and offered magazines and was seated quickly. However, I am not sure I'll be back as I was not really happy with my cut.

I have very thick heavy hair so normally need some texturizing and thinning. I always cringe when stylists thin my hair by going through bluntly with thinning shears (this place does use that technique so just be aware) and removing volume that way. I always find it makes my hair uneven and grows out poorly especially if it's not done well. My personal preference is really to do point cutting with scissors which is more work intensive for the stylists (i.e. they take sections of hair and trim the ends working through each section) and thinning that way and it gives my hair a much smoother graduated natural cut. I did feel the layering in my hair was quite chunky. The hair dresser wasn't too happy with my (I think, gentle) ask to have more graduated layers so the rest of the hair cut was very uncomfortable and I felt very uncomfortable.

It's hard to complain as the price was very reasonable and it may be personal preference, but for my thick, dark hair, I just prefer a different style of cutting and I would probably not return.",2018-03-16T00:11:02Z,207
317,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"I came here a few times before, but this will be the first time I write a review for this place. I called in on the day of and they had an opening so I drove over swiftly. It's convenient that they have a Starbucks next door I could grab breakfast from. It's also a nice touch that they offer you a drink and some pocky to nibble on throughout your session. My stylist was Aya. She was very sweet and I told her all I wanted was a bit of a trim, and she delivered. I liked the fact that she didn't try to talk to me during our session cause it was one of those days I just wanted peace and quiet. Only thing I think a little bit more of would be nice = a longer massage. I think the massage only lasted for 30 seconds or less. But that's just my take on the whole thing. And it'd be nice if their hair wash station was a bit more comfortable. However, for $40 (not including tip), the price for a ladies cut + shampoo + blow dry is truly a bargain.",2016-10-16T16:48:39Z,207

I was offered coffee/tea on arrival then Jun, the stylist, took some time to ask what type of cut I want and really listened. After he was done, Aya took over to blowdry and style my hair and gave me tips on how to maintain the health of my hair. I also go a scalp and shoulder massage just before styling.

As I went to pay, I received a 20% discount for being a first time customer. I would definitely go back again!",2017-04-06T20:26:43Z,207

The salon has a nice casual ambience. Also love the pocky and free drink that come with the haircut.",2019-04-01T19:37:35Z,207

My hair (I had three different colors in in due to another stylist from a different salon, then from me trying to fix it myself with a box color ) was a mess and he was able to fix it for me!  Took two separate appointments but was totally worth it!!! He was super patient and although at first there was a slight language barrier, it all worked out wonderfully!  The pocky and drinks are nice, but the service and technique from the stylists are what will keep me coming back!",2018-11-28T19:43:26Z,207

They offer a drink and pocky sticks while you relax on a sofa chair, let them handle the rest.  After hair care massage is offered which is the cherry on top.

I been to both the Oak and West Broadway locations and are equally good.  Every time I come I know I will have a good haircut each time.

I think they accept walk ins but advance reservations recommended as they are busy on each day.  Watch for promos they sometimes offer.

Great job Hive!",2016-05-30T18:51:16Z,207
322,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"Let me start off with you guys service is worth much more. I can't believe its $28 for a haircut w/hair wash and scalp massage also its great how they take off 20% off your first cut. Coming all the way from Hawaii and with the same service its $40 plus 15%-30% tip. 

I forgot who I had but he's an awesome hair stylist and he took me in when I didn't make an appointment I was willing to wait since I saw he was quite busy but worked on my hair and another customer at the same time. He knew what I wanted when I explained how I would like my hair cut. By watching him, i could tell he is very thoroughl, took pride in his work. 

The young lady who talked to in the front was very polite and informative. I love how I was offered something to drink while I waited and there was them chocolate covered sticks while u get hair done. *fist bump*

When I came in for my visit today Nishi offered tea and pocky sticks for me as well as my partner who was just accompanying me, which was very thoughtful. Nishi understands what I want in the hair style with great ease and always does a great job, I like that he always double checks if the length he cuts is okay since some hairstylists tend to make assumptions and cut too much too fast.

I have had some exciting results and average outcomes here, but I think the average is better than had I gone to other salons in this price range.

First of all, when I was booking an appointment over the phone, I was told they offer a discount to the first-time clients which I think is awesome!

The salon is not very fancy but I came there for the haircut, and I got a really good one, so...

My stylist was Jun, he was very attentive, asked a lot of questions about my hair routines and habits, but didn't talk too much which I really appreciate. The haircut itself didn't take long so I was a bit concerned at first, but when I saw the final result I was very impressed! And now a few days later and after a wash and styling on my own, I see Jun did a great job!

I also liked the head and neck massage a lot, this nice bonus to the overall experience:)

When I arrived there they could only find an appointment for someone with a similar name and another one for someone with a similar phone number. I'm not sure how other salons handle this type of situations, I just assume they'd at least try to figure something out like squeezing me in somehow or book me for another time.

I was very happy with my haircut from Jun, I felt he understood what I wanted and was very thorough with the haircut.

Last minute my husband also decided he needed a haircut so he tagged along hoping to get in a walk-in.  

The salon itself is not very big but quite cozy, with some sofas with a huge stack of Japanese magazines at the front for you to pick through to find the haircut of your dreams.  They fit my husband in too and we were given questionnaires to fill out regarding our hair and expectations.  

You get to sit in comfy arm chairs during your appointment (which actually worked out really well despite my hair being super long and almost to my waist) and yes, it's true, there is tea, there is Pocky (I was so glad and devoured all of mine).  

My hairstylist, Marina, was very thorough and conscientious, asking me questions and showing me pictures before she started to make sure we were on the same page with my haircut since I was planning on cutting off quite a lot of it.  I appreciated that she took her time to make sure everything was just right and I didn't feel rushed at all. 

For $38 (womens) or $28 (mens) you get a cut, wash, blow-dry, and head massage.  First time customers get 20% off and if you refer 3 friends you get 20% off 5 haircuts....so...tell them I sent you!",2015-04-11T05:57:13Z,207
335,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"*UPDATED*

Gone back for a second hair cut - why? Cause i had a really good experience last time (and this time was no different) and 2, cause I had a coupon.

Let's be honest - these guys are awesome. 
My second experience was just as good, if not better! Went on a week day where they weren't as busy. I had two girls work on my hair. They were both so so good! You know how some times you feel obligated to talk to them? Nope not these ladies. They were the happy medium. (Although I wish they introduced themselves! So proper recognition could be given!)

If you read my previous review, you'll know what I mean when I say I'm super picky about my hair (huge...thick .... lotsa volume... kinda dead on the ends).
My stylist did the job! She didn't over do it! Just as I had asked! 

Although I dont get the same person cutting, I really don't mind cause I'm 2-for-2! I'll be back!


After years of going to the same place, I felt it was time for me to switch it up. I've always heard good reviews from my friends who have been to Hive so I figured it was time to give it a shot. 

There's always a sense of nervousness when you go to a new hair salon (it's like a first date but you only talk in the beginning and see where it leads you ;) ). 
My hair is super long and thick. And by long i mean down to my tail bone and when I sit my hair folds on my lap. I always get told ""wow you have a lot of hair, it's super thick"" and this time was no different. 

Again, I haven't had a hair cut in two years so getting one was a huge deal for me. I have a baby now and he's started to grab and pull my hair. I didn't want a short bob because i DO like my long hair.
However, I REALLY needed my hair thinned out and chopped off!

I showed my hair stylist (I think her name was ray? I can't remember but she also had long hair!) a lot of pictures and expressed my concerns. She told me what her thoughts were and I came out with a BANGING hair cut! It sat just slightly pass my shoulders with soft layers. I loved it. 

Some notable pluses are
- complimentary drink and pocky sticks
- head//shoulder massage 
- 20% off for first timers! 

I'll definitely refer my family/friends to this place. I'm super picky about my hair and my stylist nailed it - a fresh do for this mama who APPRECIATES long hair!",2017-06-24T16:34:40Z,207
336,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"Update: Since writing this review I was contacted by either the Owner or Manager (not sure which one) of Hive who apologized to me for my unsatisfactory experience and offered to fix my hair for free or give me a discount on a service, the next time I came in. He also said he would consider my comments and make an effort to not repeat the experiences for his clients moving forward. I have not been back to take him up on this offer but I think that this is worth mentioning. The tone of his message felt very genuine and not just marketing. Kudos to Hive for making the effort. Cheers!

Deleting the below not very positive review for Hive because I don't think it is fair to the business to have this blemish on their record for something that happened a long time ago and they may be full of awesomeness now!
At the time I did address my dissatisfaction directly to Hive in person before I posted the review, (which I think is appropriate and a kinder thing to do rather than just posting a bad review) and because it was my third time this happened.
 Maybe I spoke with the wrong person because they were not very responsive and just asked me to sit and wait to fix my hair again for the same busy stylist. 
After posting the review they contacted me as I mentioned above.
I would recommend them, based on their honest attempts to resolve the issue.

349,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"I just had my hair cut with Yu. She is an amazing hair stylist. I gave her very vague instructions and she was able to give the exact hair cut I imagined, if not better. She was super gentle and patient. I'm not usually a talker and she didn't force a conversation (extra bonus!). Can't say enough good things about Hive -- great hair cut, great service, chocolate pocky, drinks and all at an extremely reasonable price.

351,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"I've taken some time to consider whether to write this review but here I am...my haircut was in the late winter. I was disappointed in the cut and it is unlikely that I will make a return visit.

The service was very hospitable and the salon is very cute. It's true that you get tea and Pocky and a very nice shampoo/conditioning and head massage. Perhaps I did not communicate well enough with my stylist or bring a photo to be specific about what I wanted. The consultation seemed to go fine and I was not looking to do anything drastic, just clean up my long hair. I also may have a limited understanding of Japanese cutting technique. End of disclaimer.

My stylist was lovely and we had a nice conversation. I was a bit startled when I saw entire lengths of my hair lying on the ground after the cut. I wear glasses so I cannot clearly see what a stylist is doing...but I could feel that the cutting was very different from what I am used to for layering.

The shampoo was in the middle of my appointment, after the majority of the cutting was done. The stylist said she would do more trimming after the wash. The shampoo stations are really comfortable and you're almost lying down during the wash. A different person did my shampoo/condition and I saw that my stylist had moved on to another client in the meantime. It was a guy's cut so I figured it wouldn't interfere with my appointment.

After the shampoo and head massage, I went back to the original chair. My stylist was not ready to return to me. The stylist who did my shampoo came back and said she'd blow dry my hair. I said that the original stylist had not finished the haircut (it was apparent that they had not been communicating with each other).

After a long wait, the first stylist finished my cut and asked how I'd like it styled. I asked if she had time to curl my hair. She said ok but the result was just having the ends curled. I know that Hive has a lower price point but I wish she had just said she didn't have time.

My disappointment is in the lack of care and organization within my appointment as well as the cut itself. The staff at the salon could not have been kinder but all the same, after I got home and styled it myself, the cut just didn't work. I came here on the recommendation of a friend who has fantastic hair but perhaps she normally puts in more time and effort to achieve her look. I felt like my hair got thinned out too drastically so it's just been a matter of growing it out and getting haircuts to correct the shape.",2013-08-15T05:09:30Z,207
352,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,This place gives subpar quality hair cuts and hires unprofessional hairstylists.  The high rating is for the tea and pocky they give out to customers but not the haircut itself.,2020-03-11T21:39:19Z,207
353,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"Based on other Yelpers review, I took a chance yesterday and went for JP Ionic Straightening.  My hair was done by Manami. I was not disappointed!! The service was impeccable down to the fine, fine details.  I loved how they cover your eyes with a soft, cotton cloth while your scalp is being massaged during the shampooing.  Only an Asian salon would care about these small details! It made me feel like the pocky pretzels, free drink and head and neck massage was just standard with the cut I got after JP straightening. The best part was the 20% off first time client discount I got! It saved me a fortune.  My total bill (with tip) only came to $225 and I'm a very happy woman.

I also noticed they had an assortment of clientele, men, women of all races in the 4 hour period I was there so despite being known as a Japanese salon, it was clear they catered to everyone.    If you're a very particular person like me, this salon is a must visit.  Appointments are highly recommended as they are packed all the time, or call ahead!",2010-08-15T21:35:05Z,207
354,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"I was here a few days ago and the service was exceptional. They had a menu for complimentary beverages. My stylist Masa showed me a picture of a hairstyle and asked if that's what I wanted. They give you a wash and rinse. A hot towel for a wipe down, and a scalp massage. Masa was meticulous and precise in how he cut and picked up that I just wanted to sit in the chair and read my magazine. He didn't try and ask me about my day or make small talk that most stylists do the first time they cut your hair. The atmosphere was modern and upbeat and the music was pleasant too. I'll definitely be back.",2016-10-14T00:42:20Z,207
355,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"After being recommended by several friends, I finally made the cross out of Richmond to try out Hive Hair Spa with a friend. I had Lei, who spoke a limited amount of English, but was courteous. I went for a haircut and got a fringe, which was pretty good; I've received tons of compliments on my new bangs. 

So far, my hair has grown out a bit but it isn't shaggy or anything, even with 3+ months. I've trimmed my bangs a bit by myself, and I don't think I desperately need another haircut until next month -- and I'll probably head back to Hive again.

Oh, and they give you Pocky and tea! That's pretty cool.",2013-04-14T23:50:44Z,207
356,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"This is a long overdue review, but I just want to get my two cents in.

I was really happy about the service - they were super attentive in making sure that I was feeling comfortable, etc.

But the hair cut... was not good. Most places I've been to wash your hair prior to starting. It was a very early morning for me, and I hadn't had time to shampoo before getting to my appointment. My hair had hairspray and dry shampoo in it, and I arrived in a bun. To my surprise, Jun just cut my hair as it was, product, dirt, and all! I probably should've said something about that, but hoped that maybe he knew what he was doing.

He did not. I couldn't stand my hair and had to go somewhere else soon after. Will not return.",2016-06-10T01:57:51Z,207
357,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"Found the salon on Google and tried it out because I wanted to try a different stylist, especially someone closer to my neighbourhood. I was excited to hear about the Japanese salon nearby.  Plus, the hot tea, pocky and comfy looking chairs were enticing. 

I went and wasn't too impressed with the results. My stylist didn't really do a lot with my hair and it didn't really look like it was cut at all! The only things about the visit were the hot tea, pocky, comfy chair, and free head and neck massage. That's about it. Sorry, Hive, I'm still sticking with my tried and trusted, usual salon.",2010-11-13T09:12:22Z,207
358,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"I think I find it funny that Hive actually has more reviews then some restaurants I know. I decided to try this place after Sachi M. gave it such a good review. Based on deduction it seems like she lives in the same neighborhood as I do so I've put a lot of trust in her reviews. 

First off, they gave me a 20% off my first visit. Many places I go, well they only a discount if your friend goes their the first time. And that's kind of stupid in my opinion that most salons have such a backward policy. So to me that is a bonus that the recognized and took time to understand things from a customers POV. 

The stylist. I'm not really fussy who cuts my hair as long as the job is done right. And she did a great job. After it was all cut, washed and waxed, I was so freaking happy. I honestly can say I don't think I got a better style in my life. I'm usually very blah about my hair, so it takes a lot for me to feel excited about hair. 

Service: Service was fantastic. Not only did my stylist get in on the chat, but the receptionist did as well. They brought me something to drink, and brought me chocolate pocky as well. And I felt so comfortable the whole time. They don't have these comfortable one seaters as their ""barber chairs."" 

And if you go, tell them that Vincent N from Yelp sent you! 

P.S. they also have free parking on the side as well.",2012-01-20T09:21:57Z,207

I go to Hive for Japanese Ionic Straightening, and really appreciate the chance to be able to read a book for three hours while being served a selection of hot and cold teas and complimentary pocky.

More importantly though, is that the people at Hive do a fantastic job at a much lower rate than one would pay downtown, and they give awesome neck & scalp massage.",2008-11-18T18:49:41Z,207
360,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"So after much debate, I decided to try a new hair salon for my first time coloring my hair. I read a range of reviews online, so I was unsure what to expect, but after a great response and consultation from the HIVE team via Facebook messenger I decided to book an appointment. When I arrived at my appointment I thought the place was great, it looked cute, modern, and pretty busy. I waited for about 15 minutes before a Japanese woman sat me down for my appointment. I told her I was there for a hair cut and balayage. For the cut, I showed her some pictures and she quickly understood what I had in mind. However, when I showed her a picture of the balayage I wanted she said it wasn't a balayage, but just highlights. I talked to someone from HIVE online before my appointment and they said it was definitely something they could do, so I was a bit confused but was fine with simple highlights. I told the hairdresser that it was important that my highlights were subtle and natural-looking. For the haircut, she was great, the hairdresser was very attentive and did a great job and I would definitely go back for a hair cut. She gave me the exact bangs and length I wanted. HOWEVER, when she dyed my hair I was nervous since this was my first time, but after the appointment, I looked in the mirror and my hair looked the EXACT SAME. The highlights were so subtle, they did not appear at all.  The hairdresser could tell I was not pleased with the coloring, so she explained that the color appeared darker than intended and it would lighten over time. This did NOT happen and no one in my family could see a difference in my hair color after the appointment. Although I loved the service at HIVE and would recommend them for a haircut, NOT for hair coloring services, it just seems that their team does not have enough expertise when it comes to dyeing hair. I felt like I paid for an overpriced haircut at the end of the day since my highlights did not appear at all.",2021-01-10T08:51:03Z,207

362,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"My go-to place for my do! =) Hair is a very particular and personal thing and especially for us gals...it can completely change how you look! I've always preferred the Japanese style and their techniques.  

This time, I was going for a drastic cut...the last time I cut my hair short, like 4 inches above my shoulder was in high school and against the preferences of the BF.  So pressure was on to find a stylist who knows her scissors!  And I found her at HIVE!!! MANAMI YOU THE BEST!!! The cut she gave me received so many comments I felt a lil' embarassed to get so much attention!! My hair went from about mid-back to just under my ears; at first I was hesitant to see my locks fall to the ground and it felt like 2-3 lbs was lifted off my head! Especially when my hair was still wet and matted to my head, my larger-than-normal didn't look that appealing with so little hair! But after she blow-dry and styled it...I was looking at younger and fresher me! I felt so light and airy and stylish with my new haircut!

The whole time Manami was very detailed in styling, layering, trimming and made sure it was even on both sides.  She gave me tips on how to style my hair afterwards and very personable from start to finish! It also helps when you step in and you feel you just stepped into your living room with comfy chairs! I guess it will feel like that if your living room has little wine glasses of Pocky and a menu of drinks you would want to hang out.  Super cute!

Most places that offer discounted prices for kids are usually the Master Cut-type places.  To find a place that provides the adult-level professional cuts and styling to the younger folks at such a reasonable price is a rare find indeed.

Lei spent almost an hour with my daughter where she first discussed various hair styles, washed and cut her hair, then styled with a curling iron.  The end result was a great job.  All that for $18.  Can't go wrong with that!  (Pocky sticks and some freshly brewed green tea for the patiently waiting dad was welcomed too!)",2013-09-05T17:28:15Z,207

After moving out of country and trying other salons, I know there is no place that compares to the service and quality here at Hive. Jun is meticulous, seasoned and knows what he's doing, as does his team of stylists. I've gotten cuts at high end salons and after 20 minutes, and a few snips they send me along my way disappointed. 

You're always greeted with a warm welcome, a drink and some pocky sticks. They offer you a blanket to keep your legs warm and an array of current gossip mags to read if you're waiting. Unlike other salons, I come in never feeling rushed. I had a dye job recently which took longer than expected and my stylist had other appointments while the dye soaked but he always ensured that I was taken care of by other stylists. What a multi-tasker! When he returned to finish my hair service he did not rush and was always attentive. I cannot stand being rushed off, you're not doing me any favours.

The service and hair cut was good.  I would not recommend coloring though.  I have long hair and asked for whole hair color.  The color comes out different at root and at the end.  The stylist put the hair dye on the root waited 10-15min then color the rest of the hair.  And the hair dye she prepared was not enough.  She had to mix more dye 2 times. After the 30minute wait. 2 of the Japanese stylists check my hair and talk among themselves.  And added more dye.  I suspect the color didn't turn out well and they had to cover it again.  No wonder my hair color is not balance.,2011-03-18T02:46:07Z,207
371,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"I had gone to Hive on Oak in June, Juki cut my hair and I was pretty satisfied.  She did a decent job, was very nice, but her English is very poor and I had a very hard time understanding her.
I returned yesterday for a trim, this time I had Nishi. 

As we got started I told him what I wanted and did not want.  The first thing I said was that I am just looking to maintain the look I already had, just needed it tidied up.  My hair is styled as an angled bob, short in back, longer in front.  I like it layered gradually in back so it's short, but not with the round ""hump"" shape at the top.  I like a clean line angling it down to the front on each side, with the right side slightly longer than the left (1/4 - 1/2"").  I told him the right side was the perfect length right now and not to touch it.  I also told him I'm growing my bangs out and not to touch them. 
When I left I knew he had not listened to most of what I had said, but didn't see exactly how bad it was until I washed and styled it myself this morning.  

From the front view you can see that the right side, which was below my chin and touching my shoulders is now barely touching my collar.  I had said do not touch that length. 
The left side is supposed to be just a tiny bit shorter than the right, and it is now a LOT shorter, with it all one length to just below the top of my ear, then oddly layered below that, with my slanted line completely gone.  It looks like a bowl cut on that side.
He also cut my bangs.
I have a hump on the back, which was the very first thing I told him I do not want.
The right side, which had a nicely slanted line now has no line at all, it's choppy and crooked and even shorter in front than I started with.

I can't even put into words how incredibly angry I am.  I will have to let this horrible mess grow out for months before I can have a normal hairstyle again.  I can't even leave the house without wearing a hat, that is how awful this is.  I will never return to Hive and will not recommend it to anyone.  I wish there was something they could do to fix this for me, but this is unfixable.  I'm embarrassed to go out in public, I don't want anyone to see me looking like this.",2017-07-31T23:44:16Z,207

374,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"Went in today for a cut and color. 
First visit - so I received a 20% discount on my total bill.
Pampered with hot tea and pocky!  
Comparisons:  I've had hair cuts and colors at most of the local hair places in GVR. 

Hair peeves: Some stylists try to solve the problem of coarse, thick,  hard to style asian hair with quasi mullets.  One indicator of things are going to  turn out is whether the stylist starts thinning with shears or with razors.  Razors are a bad sign.

I have come to appreciate the experience at most Japanese salons because they go the extra mile on service -- not to mention being more experienced with asian hair texture. 
Now that I've tried Hive...I'm going to have to say that Hive and Chura are definitely tied for the top hair spot in vancouver.  
What Hive does better is a shorter wait time for getting an appointment.  I typically have to book with Chura 2 weeks ahead.  Hive was a mere 3 days wait and the experience was comparable or even slightly better. 

Manami was my stylist.  She was easy to talk to, knowledgeable, and very professional.  She did an amazing job on my thick unmanageable hair.  The color is just as I wanted and my hair cut is so flattering!!  She thinned my hair out perfectly with scissors, gave me long layers, swoopy bangs, and gave tips  on care and styling.  The color she gave me flattered my skin and was perfect. 

A bit more pricey than my usual, but for a girl who gets a cut every 3 -6 months, very do-able.  Loved Hive!! Definitely a recommend and worth being a regular for.",2010-06-11T19:50:12Z,207
375,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"The main reasons I keep coming back to Hive is because: (a) price is great for a style cut, (b) the staff are incredibly hospitable, and (c) you get pocky, green tea or other drinks, and a nice scalp massage with the cut.

I tried Zeal for a bit, but I found that the service and quality of the cut are not as consistent as Hive. They're also more expensive. The only reason I shifted away from Hive was because the location is somewhat inconvenient and you have to book at least a few days in advance.

Just to note, it's a good idea to come prepared with a picture of how you want your hair cut or styled (or go early and dig through their magazines). The staff are fantastic, but sometimes their English is still a work-in-progress. It helps with the communication when you can actually show them what you want.",2013-11-04T05:59:51Z,207
376,Hive Hair Spa,4.2,"I walked in one Tuesday afternoon, with my fingers crossed, hoping that Hive would have a spot for me, and luckily they did! On a whim, I decided to colour my hair bright, bright, bright firetruck red and cut off a few inches as well. Lay was incredibly kind and thoughtful when working on my hair, and listened to my wants and needs. Also, for individuals who want to donate their hair, Hive will wrap it up nicely in saran wrap for you, ready to deliver to your choice of charity/organisation! 

Because this salon is run by Japanese hair stylists, there are many magazines full of Asian friendly hair styles and colours at the front just aching for your attention. All of the stylists definitely have more of an ""Asian style"" when cutting hair. 

While waiting for a seat, you'll be offered either a hot or cold drink and pocky. (A delicious and welcoming treat if I do say so myself!) 

One of my favourite parts of getting anything done at Hive is the initial shampooing and scalp massage afterwards. During the wash, you're given a towel to place on your eyes, so there's no need for awkward eye contact, or being blinded by the ceiling lights! Plus, there's something about getting your hair washed with your eyes closed that's so, incredibly therapeutic. After the wash, you're offered a scalp massage, which you'd be silly not to accept! 

Due to the fact that my hair was a dark brown, I required a full hair bleaching and then colouring. I was charged $80 for the bleaching and $80 for the red hair colouring. (Essentially just x2 colouring). My haircut was regular price (around $35 I believe? Don't quote me on that...), and my total came out to be near $160. If you like their Facebook page, you'll receive 20% off! 

Also, first-time customers receive 20% off! There is literally nothing you can lose! Check out Hive Hair Spa, you won't regret it!

383,Kim Loan Beauty Salon,4.3,"There are two people who work here, both are LOVELY, but one is blatantly more skilled.

The first couple of times I got my haircut I was lucky to get Kim, which was awesome.  She didn't cut to much, to my request and layered beautifully.

When I got someone new... 
Yeah, they were equally as nice, which makes it so much harder to write this review, but I'm not that happy with my latest haircut.  The ONLY reason I wanted to get my haircut was because my layers were over grown, but I didn't mind getting a trim for the length of my hair.  She asked me beforehand how much I wanted, and even showed me with her fingers to clarified.  It was about half an inch, but in the end I'm pretty sure she cut off at least 2-3 inches... I know it's just hair, but it's also a service that I'm paying for.  I've also been working extremely hard to grow my hair that whatever she cut off took about 9 months for me to grow.  The layers aren't even nice.  They DON'T frame my face, and STILL look overgrown, it's like she didn't even touch it!  She only cut the length, which is the OPPOSITE of what I wanted.  

Nonetheless, I could have been more direct with what I wanted, so I will take part of the blame.  I still tipped well since the lady who cut my hair was lovely, and that being said, makes it harder to complain.  I'm more upset with my layers if anything, because even if it was short -if it was more flattering I wouldn't complain because at least it'd grow out nicely.

The place is clean, and if you come often they WILL remember you!  The times I came they always greeted their customers with hospitality and the customers always seem to be long term, loyal customers. 

I will probably go again, but will request Kim LOL.

Reason for my rating - their haircuts aren't anything special so -1 star, the differences in quality between workers -1 more star.

Edit: I came back and asked them to retouch my layer, which they were happy to comply to.  I gave them another star for that :) much happier now.",2015-02-01T02:28:30Z,9

386,Kim Loan Beauty Salon,4.3,My favourite hair salon! Kim understands right away what you wanted done to your hair... I still go back to her for my haircuts even if I live kilometers away!,2015-05-15T14:58:45Z,9
387,Kim Loan Beauty Salon,4.3,"PRO-TIP #1:  To save money, cut your own damned hair.
PRO-TIP #2:  If you don't know how to cut hair - to not look like a complete jackass: just shave your head.
PRO-TIP #3:  Take all the money you save on haircuts and buy a massive collection of sick hats to cover your ugly head.

It's been years since I've gone to somewhere for a haircut - but since I decided to grow out my hair for an occasion.  I was lost in the woods.  I went to my usual barber... 'Holy fuck?  They shut down?'... continue down the street, head racked with guilt that my decision to shave my head put someone out of business... walk into another barbershop... ""No - I don't have an appointment... what the fuck is this?  A lawyer's office?!?  Just cut my fucking hair!""... get kicked out... continuing wander aimlessly down the street.

'Aw shit - a BEAUTY SALON?  Oh shit - it's a hairdresser.  And she's hot ironing her own hair.  Fuck... but at least she's Vietnamese.'  I was hesitant to say the least - but I needed a haircut that day as my hair was getting uber-nappy.

Shop is clean and hairdresser is friendly and fast.  A decent box cut - not exactly how I wanted it but pretty close.  $12.",2011-05-13T05:45:54Z,9
388,Kim Loan Beauty Salon,4.3,"Been here twice in a month as it's near my residence. It's a no frills type of operation, so don't expect it to look like a trendy salon. There's two stylists working. One is the owner and the other is the employee. Both times I stopped by, the shop seem to be popular with people from all walks of life, from students to grandparents. The working class to the elite (ok, maybe not the elite, but you know what I'm saying). There's plenty of street parking in front of the shop (mind you, no parking between 3-6pm on weekdays), and plenty of side-street parking (Kamloops St.). My first visit was served by the employee whom seem inexperienced as she kept asking the owner for pointers, and the haircut turned out to be passable. My second visit was served by the owner herself, and she did an excellent job. She's quite socialable, and gentle with the trimmer, which matched well with her soft-spoken demeanor. The cut cost $10 (incl. tax without wash), and I was quite happy walking out. To be honest, I hesitated in writing this review for my own selfishness cause I didn't want this place to be popular which would then equate to 1 hour waits. But again, there are times in life where a man needs to step-up and be selfless - this is that time.",2015-11-14T00:10:04Z,9
389,Kim Loan Beauty Salon,4.3,"Not the owner but the other woman, polite and knows her hair, does great kids' hair cuts for very reasonable. Thumbs up.",2011-05-28T01:28:26Z,9

391,Vancity BarberShop,5.0,My boyfriend got a haircut and beard trim by Hamza and it turned out amazing! He is very detailed and meticulous with his work. Highly recommend this place and so glad we found it.,2023-04-29T18:48:56Z,5
392,Vancity BarberShop,5.0,Great experience and highly recommended!  Also a great location in Coal Harbour.   I've been a customer for almost 2 years.  Very happy!,2021-02-18T23:23:36Z,5
393,Vancity BarberShop,5.0,"Hamza, the owner of Vancity Barbershop, is a real artist with hair. I've been seeing him for a couple of years at the previous shop where he worked, and I was thrilled to discover that he had opened his own shop on Granville Street. 

I'd been going to one of the top salons in town for years, but I couldn't get my regular stylist one day, and needed a haircut for a meeting. So I was walking by his shop at the time and decided to take a chance. I was very glad that I did. He did a brilliant job. I got nothing but unsolicited compliments about my hair for weeks after. And he did it for less than half the price that I'd been used to paying. 

I'll admit, I was a little terrified seeing those clippers coming at me, but the result was outstanding. Hamza is a good guy and brilliant barber. I highly recommend this shop.",2019-10-18T08:35:04Z,5
394,Vancity BarberShop,5.0,"I got a really good haircut from Hamza this afternoon at his shop on 505 Bute Street. He was very attentive to how I wanted my hair to be cut, and ensured that my hair style and length was exactly as I wanted. Very fast and friendly service, at a very fair price as well. I'll definitely be going back to Vancity Barber Shop!",2021-11-19T03:33:37Z,5
395,The Barber Shop,4.2,"I am a Black woman with short 3C type curls. I have gotten my hair cut at The Barber Shop before by Finn and had a fantastic experience, but today I got my hair cut by Louie and had a horrible experience. From the moment I walked in, I could tell he was not educated on how to cut my hair type. I requested a small simple trim to cut 1 inch of damaged hair off, which was at about 5 inches and he proceeded to tell me the longest he could keep it is 1 inch because he said he wasn't qualified to use scissors on my ""black hair"". Throughout the whole haircut, everything he said to me was about me being Black, having ""Black hair"" (to which I corrected him and told him I preferred the term ""Afro hair"" but then continued to say ""Black hair""), and randomly bringing up a distant connection of his to a person who is Nigerian, my status in Vancouver, and other racist comments. Despite me telling him I did not want a lineup, he proceeded to give me one before I stopped him and then when he was finished, he described my hair as ""sticky""??? He did not have any tools that were meant for my hair, both physical and social. I was consistently kind and patient with him, even as he continued to make comments that made me feel less than human. The whole experience made me feel exoticized, and like I did not belong in that shop. As a Black woman, I was disappointed but unfortunately not surprised by this treatment. I would hope that as a certified barber in a very international city, Louie would have the knowledge, experience, and basic human decency to know how to cut hair texture other than a white man's. The worst part of the experience wasn't how my haircut turned out, but rather the objectifying conversation Louie insisted on.",2023-04-21T02:55:24Z,16
396,The Barber Shop,4.2,"Got a cut and beard trim from Roland and he did an excellent job. This is a true barbershop and I received a straight-razor shave and hot towels. I don't usually like to talk too much with my barber but Roland kept a very entertaining conversation going the entire time. Overall, it was a great experience.

I was also very happy with the price.",2019-11-04T23:16:59Z,16
397,The Barber Shop,4.2,"Edited: came back a second time. Was a much busier day, and the cut unfortunately suffered. Still have extremely uneven sections on my head I've tried to fix up. Maybe it was a bad day, but I've changed my review to reflect the most recent visit and average out both days)

Popped in today, and (name redacted) took great care of me. First, I am TERRIBLE at explaining what I want out of a haircut... The best I can do is give some general description, then pulling out the best of a poor selection of selfies to help. It doesn't help that I tend to go 3-4 months between haircuts (or longer), so the barber doesn't really have an idea of how it had been previously cut.

(Barber) asked the right questions to figure out what I wanted, and then instead of trying to cut it as short as he thought I want it (which, based on previous experiences, barbers tend to ultimately overshoot), he aimed for a little longer knowing he could ultimately take more off soon. Turned out he absolutely nailed it. Finally, when he finished up, he told me WHAT to tell barbers in the future (have never had somebody tell me that before). He didn't expect me to come back, but I definitely will.

On top of the great cut, he provided some great conversation to boot.  Highly recommended, and a great value $21 cut.",2017-11-04T00:25:36Z,16
398,The Barber Shop,4.2,"Came in after seeing the good reviews but had a pretty amateur haircut. Told my stylist I wanted to grow the top out a bit. Wanted a trim and cleanup. That's it. 

Asked for a fade on the side starting with a number 2. The lines were so distinct and not blended well. She blended it so poorly that she ended up taking the number 2 all the way up the side. Then had to take more of the top to balance it out.  Ended up with a military type crew cut. My hair looked better before i came in. 

At least it will grow back out.",2016-05-30T20:57:50Z,16
399,The Barber Shop,4.2,"I'm hesitant to give this place a five star review purely for personal reasons. In the past few years it has gotten much busier, but that's well deserved. For the price you pay, you get an excellent haircut, hot towel and straight razor on the neckline.  This is my go-to barber, but do plan your timing as it can be busy and they're not open particularly late.",2018-12-05T04:18:45Z,16
400,The Barber Shop,4.2,"Great place. Great service. They give you the traditional barber shop treatment (hot towel, cream, straight blade) but are also modern (I show them sample photos on my phone of what I want and they don't disappoint). I always ask for Robyn and she does a great job.",2016-04-08T20:53:07Z,16
401,The Barber Shop,4.2,"Pros: Joanna did my undercut pomp really well, just needed to explain well what you want on your first visit. Shop was clean and friendly people.

Cons: no credit/debit, just cash so dont forget to bring some.

402,The Barber Shop,4.2,"This is my favorite barber shop in Vancouver! I've been coming here for a few years after exploring a few other shops in the area. They have a great range of simple and complex cuts and I love the hot towel after. Roland also went out of his way to lend me a book after we had a great conversation during my last cut, that I'll return when I go back in - such a nice gesture!",2020-03-14T05:32:18Z,16
403,The Barber Shop,4.2,Best shop in town. Great staff pay attention to detail and provide a high quality haircut. The best part of all is that they VACUUM your head afterwards. No more little rogue hairs - you can actually go straight to a job interview after this place.,2019-12-28T18:39:38Z,16

405,The Barber Shop,4.2,"My first time here! The funny thing is this place is 10 minutes walk from home and I never knew about it.

Anyway, I walk in and Maria greets me cheerfully (although it was 20 minutes before closing time). The service was impeccable, non-rushed and some of it un-expected. Like the little touches: straight-razor cleanup after, the talc powder puff and those hair vacuums!

Now waiting to go back again!",2014-02-14T04:01:20Z,16
406,The Barber Shop,4.2,"Been there three times with three different barbers.. was growing out a buzzed cut so I only had my sides and back done... all done by different barbers.. they were ok.  Hard to really judge as they didnt have much to work with in terms of styling etc... the second time I went, forgot the name of the barber, but the fade wasn't done that great on one side... they charged me regular price all three times for pretty much a cleanup that took 10 mins..",2016-02-12T23:57:31Z,16

409,The Barber Shop,4.2,"I've found my new regular barber shop! I had my first visit there this past weekend and had a great experience. For their price you get soo much more then salons and other shops. He saw exactly how my hair was styled and knew what to do.
