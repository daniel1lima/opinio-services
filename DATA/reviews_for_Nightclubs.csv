0,Levels Nightclub,4.0,"We were visiting Canadaand got bottles. The place is large and has a variety of edm and hip hop. My friends and I had a blast. The only thing that was a small issue was that you have to go down a flights of stairs to the use the bathroom. However, the bathroom section has a lot of bathrooms available. I would definitely come again.",2023-11-22T07:49:47Z,5
1,Levels Nightclub,4.0,Good music but they didn't have half the place open which kinda sucked. Quick service on drinks though,2023-10-02T18:34:14Z,5
2,Levels Nightclub,4.0,"Will have to say it's by far one of the better night clubs I've been to in Vancouver. It's new and the lay out is quite impressive, making it a spacious venue. There are three levels (bathrooms, dance floor, and lounge). 

We got on the guest list so cover was free for us. Would recommend this option even if it means coming a little earlier to the club! 

The music was decent. They play pretty popular music and it's easy to dance to. 

I especially liked the bottom floor where they had different sections of decorated walls to take pictures of (perfect for Instagram). The bathrooms are also really nice and they have perfume and cologne for people to freshen up with! 

The only thing I would say that could be improved would be the entry line. It can get pretty confusing since when you enter, you're in a dark narrow hallway and it can be challenging when people are trying to check in while others are trying to exit the club. 

Overall, great venue and I know I'll come again the next time I visit!",2019-06-23T18:55:13Z,5
3,Levels Nightclub,4.0,"Overall - a really impressive nightclub in Vancouver. We reserved for the guest list on the website in the morning and we were able to get in with no cover fee (they won't send an email confirmation of guest list though - hopefully this is added soon). Getting there at 10PM on a Saturday when it opened, there was already a pretty long line to get in (waited about 25 min). After getting in and stamped, we hopped around some other clubs before coming back to this one (around midnight when there were many more people). 

Crowd was mainly younger people in their 20s. Didn't get the chance to try out the bar but it seemed to be pretty popular as expected. The space itself is beautiful - three stories (although the third floor was closed when we were there). Bottom floor is a huge bathroom space with several walls to take photos. 

Music-wise, lots of Top 40-esque type music remixed as EDM - pretty easy to get into but it's not for everyone. 

All in all - highly recommend this be any person's stop for nightlife in Vancouver!",2019-06-23T17:31:17Z,5
4,Levels Nightclub,4.0,"Good club. Good atmosphere and drinks, but the music leaves a lot to be desired. 3 stars.",2020-02-23T18:37:48Z,5
5,The Roxy,3.5,"Oh my goodness, it has been a while since I've been out but this is a rocking place. 

Dance party central! Music is awesome with a great DJ but the band was stellar! Totally recommend this place for a night out. Decor is nothing to get excited about but who cares if your just want to dance!

The place gets really crowd so if you want a seat go early.",2019-12-16T05:19:06Z,120
6,The Roxy,3.5,I had an order of lasagnefrom Alki's and they would not let me bring it in to the bar even though I said i would be very clean and good. I told them I would eat elsewhere. I will never try to eat here again.,2024-03-30T02:14:52Z,120
7,The Roxy,3.5,Amazing always a consistent good time. Lots of beautiful women beautiful experiences clothes off when they're on the floor boys if you're looking for fun and I will find a better place.,2023-08-01T02:26:46Z,120
8,The Roxy,3.5,Pretty cool place with a pretty solid environment and good music. I'd recommend it if you haven't been,2023-08-24T07:32:27Z,120
9,The Roxy,3.5,"We returned to The Roxy since Covid to listen to more live music.  At the entrance the bouncers checked for Covid Passports.  They were extremely respecful  and patient when denying some patrons entry and handled the line up well. The service at the bar was so super, Everett the bar tender was also friendly and respectful and generous with the drinks. He had good energy to serve the public. The drinks were satisfying as they usually are. The live music was also incredible , both bands had the customers mesmerized. The crowd was friendly, fun, respectful and all ages so anyone would feel comfortable here. A clean, safe happy environment that I am happy to  return to.",2021-10-30T23:03:26Z,120
10,The Roxy,3.5,Live band and more.. first time went with friends it was quiet nice and good service.,2023-04-28T04:38:00Z,120
11,The Roxy,3.5,"So many sweaty men! Weak drinks that are overpriced, basic music, takes 20+ minutes to get a drink from the overwhelmed bartenders, and the doorman did nothing to balance out men and women. Trashy.",2022-12-25T09:58:26Z,120
12,The Roxy,3.5,"Country music night on a Sunday? Yes please! Great to see a club like this change it up and have a country music night, excellent vibe from the whole place and all the guests looked to be having a great time.",2023-08-25T06:52:07Z,120
13,The Roxy,3.5,you want me to tip your bouncer to get in?! terrible business practices.,2023-03-26T22:47:09Z,120
14,The Roxy,3.5,"Sundays at the Roxy seem to be the place to go! 

It's Country night, Yahoo!! I'm so not a country girl, but they do a great job at playing lively country with a lot of rock cross-over and a touch of this and that to keep all entertained! The thing I really enjoy about the Roxy is the live entertainment. Again, even though Country is not my personal favorite, there are so many good groups that play here its easy to enjoy the Country, most of it anyhow.

It's an older looking bar and it's definitely a little ""dive like"" but a fun and respectable dive bar. The bathrooms are always working and fairly clean with toilet paper, unlike most ""Dive bars"" in Van. They have pleasant door staff/cashiers. In fact, I was very impressed the cash lady picked up on it being my birthday week and waved my cover! Nicely done!! That was much appreciated. 

Fair amount of seats with tables and booths, if you get there early enough! You also get a good mix with the crowd, both in age and style. I appreciate that and it usually shines through in a solid venue. In reality, everyone is different, but we all just wanna get tipsy and have a good time listening to awesome tunes!

The also have a pool table at the back bar which we all wait patiently to play.",2018-02-01T01:35:24Z,120
15,The Roxy,3.5,"order the cheese table! do it, you wont be disjointed.",2017-07-11T22:29:52Z,120
16,The Roxy,3.5,I came here two days in a row. And both times weren't bad. There was a live band on Friday and Saturday nights that did mostly covers. The drinks were okay and there were a decent amount of seating. The people seemed really cool and extremely nice. I mean Vancouver in general is pretty clean and safe.,2013-05-24T09:42:52Z,120
17,The Roxy,3.5,"A consistent good time ~ that place is a fail safe for a super fun night out with friends. I love it because it's casual, live band, good drinks (and as busy as it is the line for the bar is never too long). Beware the line starts early!",2015-09-10T13:24:41Z,120
18,The Roxy,3.5,The bar itself is decent but one bartender has her head up her ass . I went in completely sober after work around 1am and she acted annoyed that I was ordering a round of drinks.. gave her $25 on a $18 tab and she was still a total bitch. If she doesn't want to serve women maybe she should work at a brothel. I had one drink and left even though there is another bar to order drinks from.. Left a bad taste in my mouth and if I ever go there again I'll be sure to tip her nothing.,2014-05-25T16:27:23Z,120
19,The Roxy,3.5,This club is so much fun! Can anyone figure out what kind of tequila they serve there? I had it and never got the name but it was amazing! I would really appreciate if someone could figure it out.,2017-02-21T04:01:30Z,120
20,The Roxy,3.5,"LOOOOVED hanging out at the Roxy! The music was fantastic, the live band this past Tuesday was amazing! I could not have asked for more.",2012-11-02T21:47:31Z,120
21,The Roxy,3.5,Roxy Sunday is always great. Good country classics and often a live band. Always deals on drinks. $7 for cover,2017-04-16T05:52:55Z,120
22,The Roxy,3.5,Great music and environment! But I'm pretty sure the bartender overcharged us on our drinks because we were from Oregon. Overall cover charge was manageable and the music and people were fantastic!,2012-11-28T18:16:46Z,120
23,The Roxy,3.5,"The Roxy is to Granville strip, what Canada place is to Vancouver itself. It's one the icon for Vancouver's club scene. If you don't want to be surrounded by snobby wannabes or pretentious teenager, this is the place for you. Live music, fun time. But the downside those who come here are too grungy and sweaty, the kind you don't want to be next to you. I always feel I need to dress down before going here instead of dressing up, just to mix in. But nevertheless, my friends love it so I keep on going back.",2011-03-07T06:42:58Z,120
24,The Roxy,3.5,"If you ever find yourself in Vancouver from out of town and are suddenly hit with the realization that all of the bars around you are shutting down around midnight, fear not...you have an amazing go-to in The Roxy. To be honest, I had heard stories about the legendary Roxy bar in the years prior to my visit. I was expecting it to be a fun time, and it definitely was. To sum-up The Roxy in 2 words, it's a Character Factory. We walked up and discovered there was a cover charge. As we were walking away to find an ATM, a woman in line kindly offered to pay our admission. Once we got inside, we found ourselves in great company with strangers from all walks of life. Everyone there is just trying to have a good time after midnight. While there, we met a treasure hunter, an ex-semi-pro hockey player (which admittedly is fairly common in Canada), a metal guitar player, and a vagabond. We had shots with all of them at our table. The service is really efficient at dealing with intoxicated people. At one point, I tripped and dropped my tray and they kindly replaced the drinks for us. Later in the evening I found the woman who paid for our cover charge. I tried to hand her a drink to say thanks. Instead, she grabbed me by the back of my head and tried to make out with me. Your experience may vary, but this is a wild and roaring good time.",2015-09-02T15:49:33Z,120
25,The Roxy,3.5,"Haven't been here in ages. Well last time here was probably like 4 years ago. So went back recently but that is because it was a celebration for my sister. So it was one of those accounting night. Yes that is the only time I would really come here. Once a year kind of thing. So nothing has changed since 4 years ago. Its still very loud and very crowded. Loud music is a must. It has a  bar near the entrance and it curves around to the side of the wall. 

There is a live band. So its not just a DJ playing music like the other clubs. People dance in front of the stage. 

I would say out of most of the bar I like this one because not many has a live band.",2017-12-01T08:59:56Z,120
26,The Roxy,3.5,"I'm disappointed because I heard this was the place to be on a weekend if you're going out. Coming from Toronto, which has a lot of nightlife regardless of the day, seeing this ""club"" was a major let down.

I went with my roommates for a Meetup group so our cover fees were waved, if not, we would have paid 13$ each!! Ridiculous amount for something so boring.

It's not a club but rather a place for bands to showcase their talents. I'm not a rock fan so I had the worst time being here but my roommate loved it! He said it was rad. In between bands, they played a bit of top 40 and oldies so I liked that but it lasted maybe 30mins. The crowd is a mixture of young and old people 

The other thing I didn't like was that they require photo ID Everytime a credit card is used - their explanation was that they didn't have a chip reader. Still, never seen this done in Toronto even with restaurants/bar with no chip reader

Safe to say I won't be coming back here. And if rock music or bands aren't your scene, don't waste your money or time",2018-03-31T16:31:44Z,120
27,The Roxy,3.5,"Our burgers were deceitful - in a good way, and you'll shortly know what I mean - because when they arrived, they looked neat and well put-together, but maybe not that tasty. However, when we took our first bites, it was a mouthful of flavours and then they gushed with meat juices and all over our hands.",2019-10-23T02:33:28Z,120
28,The Roxy,3.5,"Its official.  This is my favorite bar in all of Vancouver.  It's also the bar for all the other bartenders and wait staff I notice from other bars.  (Shhhh....don't tell their managers...oh wait sometimes I see them here too!).  The bands are great and keeps the party bumping.  Special Mention to the new band Tattoo Alibi and Troy's R Us whom can play basically anything and keep the party bumping.  The dance floor is large enough and always busy and there's always something to do around the bar.   You'll find table hockey and phone chargers at the side bar, pool tables and photo booths in the back bar.  I always have a good time here.  Even on a bad night I always end up feeling better ending my nights here.  

The song that I use to describe this bar would be Toby Keith's I love this bar because I love this bar!  Everyone is nice and friendly, my favorite bartenders include Cat, Stephanie, Michelle, Sasha, Joe, Everette, Irv, Jaralin, everyone here is awesome.  Special mention to Cat whom's in the back bar.  (The music is bumping in the main room, but the party is in the back bar with the pool tables and photo booth where conversations are easier.  Plus grab your friends or some other patrons and ask Cat for a game of who am I and she'll gladly oblige.  For those that don't know what game that is, watch inglorious bastards.  It's the game in the basement before everyone gets shot up.)

Randy keeps the show running, Jarrad and Danielle always have some great promo nights planned.  It's pretty awesome.  Special mention to all the bouncers whom are all nice friendly and welcoming  people (unless of course they have to take action.)  This bar is pretty much the busiest bar on Granville every night of the week including weekdays.  The porters are all friendly, Franco, Alex, Dhillon. 

Tjana and Mara are always great in coat check and Ashleigh and Darcy have always been friendly at the front.

This place has earned it,  5 stars to the Roxy and their wonderful staff.",2015-04-16T17:37:30Z,120
29,The Roxy,3.5,"Finally had a chance to see what THE Roxy was all about.  Knock another one off the bucket list.

Parking is horrendous here.  Try the side streets far away.

The venue looks like it has been added to and modified over the years.  There is a stage one side, and 3 (yes, 3) bars from which one can purchase alcoholic beverages.  For a more quiet experience, the 3rd bar is tucked away in the back, behind the 2nd bar.  There is a pool table there too.

The night I went, there was a cowboy band playing.  Actually not bad at all.  Once they got the tunes going, the dance floor quickly filled up.  Once in a while, they let groups of ladies up on the stage as well.

The music is loud, but not blow-your-eardrums loud, which is a nice change compared to other Vancouver clubs.  One can actually somewhat have a conversation here.

Drinks were a bit pricey, but it's a club after all.

Definitely a good time.",2015-07-21T05:56:59Z,120
30,The Roxy,3.5,"It's a pretty nice place to hang with your friends, have a drink and watch a band play. The prices of drinks are expected. Service is alright.

There's a beam in the middle that sort of blocks your view of the stage if you sit near the center at the tables though.",2019-11-15T21:59:10Z,120
31,The Roxy,3.5,Great bands! Great music! Great fun! Dave the bartender was awesome! What a great night in Vancouver!,2022-05-12T03:57:26Z,120
32,The Roxy,3.5,Live music is alright. Need to do a better job at restocking the toliet paper in the women's washrooms though....,2022-05-15T09:12:09Z,120
33,The Roxy,3.5,"This was a fun place to go on a Saturday night with a group of gals, celebrating our beloved bride-to-be.  We were bar hopping and found this place along the way, fortunately.  To be honest - I liked it better than most of the other places we went to because it wasn't a clubby vibe!  It's a very casual bar with live music, playing rock.  So I was a fan.

There's a bar area and then a huge space for dancing where the main stage is.  On a Saturday it was very lively, and in fact, there were two other bachelorette parties here where the singer even called up the brides.  There's nothing pretentious or superficial about The Roxy, which is what I like about this place.  The crowd also seems older and really here for the music, not to party.  Overall, this is a great bar playing indie rock in downtown Vancouver.",2017-11-12T01:14:14Z,120
34,The Roxy,3.5,My friends and I came up to Vancouver for a couple days and went to Roxy two nights in a row! We love the live music and the bartenders. Being women the bouncers were on top of making women feel safe and we very much appreciated that.,2022-03-18T19:34:20Z,120
35,The Roxy,3.5,"Oh, the Roxy. Many of my fresh-19 nights were spent here on Roxy Sundays. 

If you like country, Sundays are the best day to go. They've got live music and line dancing, and plenty of liquor to go around. Compared to other clubs on the Strip, The Roxy is fairly smaller. They have 2 main bars, one right next to the dance floor, and one in the back room by the pool table. 

Service is usually hit or miss. They're fairly busy on most nights, so it can take a little bit longer to get a drink. But just be patient and be kind to the bartenders and you'll eventually get your drink. 

Roxy is fun on other nights too. Honestly, I've only been here one or two other times that weren't on a Sunday, and it was still a great time. 

One of the great things about the Roxy is that it's on the Strip, so if you want to leave the club to get food, there are plenty of late night options! 

Many drinks were had and fun memories were made at the Roxy, so cheers to them!",2018-06-04T05:47:39Z,120
36,The Roxy,3.5,"Really fun spot! I'm not too familiar with the area, but this spot was recommended by several friends as well as my hotel staff. I had a fabulous time and spent my entire night there (though I had planned on exploring Granville). There was live music but they played hits that we all knew and sang along to- good mix of modern chart toppers and throwbacks. The bartenders were really cool and the vibe of the place was awesome. Can't wait to go back!",2018-12-10T22:46:13Z,120
37,The Roxy,3.5,"We were staying about 2 blocks from Granville St, so we asked our host how to get a ""local"" taste of Vancouver. She mentioned this place with a little of hesitation saying that it was full of ""interesting characters"", so we knew we HAD to go here! We got here around 11pm/midnight, so we had to pay cover of $13.

The atmosphere: One expectation needs to be set: this is NOT a classy bar establishment---but it is a fun time. The Roxy is divided into 2 areas, one with a bar and an open are with a few tables/bar stools, and then the inside of the Roxy, which had tables, and a stage set up for bands. We miraculously found a table to sit at right near the bar. The place was packed and busy! We definitely did meet a few interesting people (like a drunk doctor who liked smashing cups..), and we had a wonderful time just being in the lively atmosphere and talking to strangers. The music is fun and upbeat. Normally, I would give a place like this 3 starts, but I'm giving it an extra star for the fun time! 

The drinks: I would be drunk before you get here. The drinks here are pricey, considering that they are pretty watered down and not strong. Their menu is a standard cocktail menu.",2016-01-09T00:33:07Z,120
38,The Roxy,3.5,"If you're looking for a bar that has rude bouncers who try to act macho all the time and male bartenders who are only willing to be nice to pretty girls, i would totally recommend this place. 

Also, the fact that they let people line up out front even though the bar is dead inside is very ridiculous.",2018-11-19T21:13:04Z,120
39,The Roxy,3.5,A girl threw up on me in the bathroom. Not the worst thing that could happen but also not the best.,2019-02-19T11:12:26Z,120
40,The Roxy,3.5,"- 7$ covers on a Thursday 
- Small area with 3 bars
- live music
- I found the dance floor to be quite small. They were also letting in way too much people, there was hardly any room to walk around without spilling a drink.
- The crowd is interesting, I'm talking people of all kinds, everyone is out to have a good time. 
- Washrooms cramped and worn down.",2017-08-27T23:57:33Z,120
41,The Roxy,3.5,"S/O to the two bouncers who I met at St. Paul's hospital. Honestly, they don't get enough credit for the job that they do. 

S/O again for remembering me and letting me in for free ;)

I was being treated for an allergic reaction. I shared a room with two gentlemen who wore The Roxy shirts - this prompted the conversation. One of them injured their hand from an altercation with a drunk dude. It's kind of scary and a reminder of how daunting their job can be, if they need to take action.

---

I always have fun at Roxy. The live music is fantastic, and the staff is always friendly and accommodating. Super atmosphere, which makes a super crowd! Everybody's bouncin' around. No young, wide-eyed kids here, but people who are out to party and not stand around eyeing others up with judgmental attitudes.",2016-08-04T07:04:14Z,120
42,The Roxy,3.5,"Went to The Roxy tonight (Friday) and the place was hopping!

Also had great bartenders and a great band that was playing some awesome cover songs. I would recommend this place for anyone who is wanting to party or dance!

Take note that there are a lot of people here!",2014-01-11T09:56:41Z,120
43,The Roxy,3.5,"Perhaps it's that I always visit on Sunday nights (and hate country music) that this venue has never really done it for me.  Lines are shockingly long and once you're in,  the layout of the first bar right at the front door leaves you feeling claustrophobic immediately.  Drink deals are pretty good as you can get a shot of tequila and a corona for ten bucks - if only you didn't have to fight for a spot to be seen at the bar.

Part of the ""charm"" or this venue is that women can often get free drinks for flashing the bartender as long as they are willing to get a lovely ""Roxy"" tattoo on their upper chest somewhere.  The whole procedure of dumping alcohol directly into girl's mouths while they sit on the bartop slows down service and is bordering on creepy. 

I'll update my review if another night of the week proves to be less crowded/more enjoyable as a whole.",2016-02-22T23:02:13Z,120
44,The Roxy,3.5,"While visiting Vancouver, I asked a few locals about which bars to go and got the following advice:

""Nobody wants to go but you always end up going to the ROXY""

""You have to go to ROXY! If you don't go, you can't say you have been to Vancouver"" 

""Well you could go to (this) bar or (that) bar but you absolutely cannot miss going to the ROXY""

So of course I just had to check it out ... 

I went during the free white Tshirt / write stupid and sexual remarks on your neighbors shirt / drink as much barcardi as you can / dance the night away type of night. 

The Roxy tries really hard to be cool. This is definitely a young kids bar and not the best for a conversation or a casual beer. You come to this place to get after it.

Not my cup o tea but maybe you will enjoi the flavor.",2012-06-13T04:03:31Z,120
45,The Roxy,3.5,"We came here on a country music night with a live band.  The band was awesome and people seemed to be enjoying the night.  The place looks alright in the dark but it probably needs some renovating around the place and possibly some new furniture.  The dance floor was a bit too small because it is just a long strip in front of the stage.  I'm surprised that the bathroom's cleanliness was not bad at all!  There's a small back section where there is a bar and a pool table.  Now here is where I deducted a star from 3 stars to 2 stars: the back section stinks and i'm not kidding you.  That is a big no no in my books, whatever that smell is, it needs to go whether you need to strip the old carpet or whatever it is.",2015-08-20T20:05:57Z,120
46,The Roxy,3.5,"Oh, the Roxy ... looks like a dump from the outside but it's one of the best bars anywhere.

I started going here years ago when I visited Vancouver and it's always fun.  

The first thing we think of for the Roxy is the band.  I've seen the same band most nights -- thin male bassist, shaved head guitarist and short brunette lead singer.  They sing EVERYTHING and it sounds amazing.  Two of my favorite covers they did were U2's One and The Outfield's Your Love.  I still remember that and they're a cover band.  They are so talented.  One of my coworkers said they'd make a great wedding band ... but then nobody would leave your wedding because they'd want to hear the next song.

There are two bars so it's convenient.  The crowd is mixed from 20s to 40s at least.  We've seen the Canucks' opponent here after a game and the girls flock to them.

If I had one issue, it's the music is always super loud.  I try to stay in the back because I'm concerned about my hearing but it tends to be loud.  No one wears ear plugs because it's not cool but I couldn't go here every night or once a week if I lived in Vancouver because of the noise level.",2010-02-14T07:15:18Z,120
47,The Roxy,3.5,"Every time me and the boys leave the Seattle area and make our way up to Vancouver, we make sure to spend at least one night partying our asses off at The Roxy. The live music that they have playing there is always amazing. Drinks aren't too pricey for a club, but that being said make sure to pregame a bit before heading here. Friendly staff pass the vibe check, would recommend to anyone heading up to Vancouver on a weekend",2020-06-30T17:34:54Z,120
48,The Roxy,3.5,"Ah, the Roxy. I remember my Roxy days well. Jaggermeister pyramids, bad band music, and dancing on the bar. All in all, a great time!

The Roxy Night Club generally appeals to an older crowd, but don't let that stop you. Featuring live bands (and, on weekends, the regular house band), the dance floor is always full.

The Roxy's not fancy, but it's long been the city's top nightlife spot because, frankly, it's just a kickass rock and roll club. Be prepared to line up.",2008-10-20T18:24:34Z,120
49,The Roxy,3.5,"""I love this bar!""  

I came here for the first time 5 years ago...a guy who knew absolutely nothing about dancing.  It was Monday night and completely dead except for 2 young couples who made me feel at ease.  I was worried about making a fool of myself and when i saw them doing dumb drunk things i realized i had nothing to worry about.  And my motivation was kept up by the astonishingly great cover band!  

I returned on different nights and discovered there were other house bands which had different sounds, talents and looks.  It was all good.  

I've gone to different clubs downtown and now not so much.  The Roxy somehow filters out the clientele that is pretentious-they don't go here it seems.  Other guys here tend to high five me rather than give me attitude like at other places.  

The staff is friendly to me even though i'm not a big spender.  I don't get it except that maybe whoever hires them does a damn good job of bringing in friendly people.  

One time way back there was this issue with a bartender and a bouncer smoothed it over for me even though he was asked to eject me.  And another time some dude pushed me on the dance floor and a bouncer was on him before i had gotten back up!

When i'm smiling, there's always a girl who wants to dance with me.  If i'm not, i'm invisible.  So my experience here as anywhere depends a bit on the energy i project.  And this is the place that makes it easiest for me to smile.",2016-08-29T12:37:41Z,120
50,The Roxy,3.5,"Decent priced drinks, great music, great crowd. Found it funny that they were playing Lion King in a club, but it added an interesting aspect. Played pool in the back which was so fun but a little cramped.",2018-04-09T17:37:03Z,120
51,The Roxy,3.5,"If you like watered down drinks and being ripped off, this is the place for you! 

If you like dancing with people twice your age (or half your age), this is also probably the place for you! 

And, if you enjoy uninterested house bands playing marginal covers, this is also probably the place for you!",2016-01-03T20:33:52Z,120
52,The Roxy,3.5,"If you are looking for a good club to go to with your group of relatively young friends (19-21) I would not recommend the Roxy. It was relatively inexpensive and the bar service was fast, but the army of older men flanking the perimeter of the club combined with the comically bad setlist basically left my group uncomfortable and feeling out of place. This place is probably great for those in the 30+ age range looking to hear some classic and party rock hits, but for the lower end of the club age range I'd recommend finding a club with a younger crowd and better entertainment.",2019-08-03T15:14:34Z,120
53,The Roxy,3.5,"The Roxy is so dear to my heart! My days at the Roxy began when I was just 18. I met so many friends there, especially my dear, precious friend Blaine (the owner) and fabulous Sasha! I spent years dancing, drinking, laughing and playing at The Roxy. I grew up there! I even met my husband there! 26 years later, here we are reminiscing about those days! We spent a weekend there a couple years ago for our anniversary. We stopped in and had the pleasure of seeing Blaine and Sasha and met all the sweet staff. They made our anniversary the best we've EVER had. My heart will always be at The Roxy.",2016-07-17T21:58:51Z,120
54,The Roxy,3.5,"I'd heard a lot of bad things about the Roxy when I was asking for suggestions on where to go on my first night out - meat market, kind of grungy ect. However, once we were already out and had left Republic (because THAT was terrible) my friend convinced me to go in; it was so much fun! There was a live band that play covers of great songs, old and new, low lighting, and a packed dance floor! Sure, there are a lot of guys there but when are there not? You do want to go with friends because if you're a pretty girl, some grosser guys will try to dance with you. I didn't have a problem with getting away from them though ahaha
I danced tons, and every other song was one of my favourites - true classics. It's very loud, but that's to be expected. 
I went there for my second time on Saturday and had even better time. The bouncer let us in cover free ""for being angelic"" and because we were celebrating my friends birthday. Such a nice guy. Wasn't too hard to get drinks once inside, and the songs were amazing as I expected. 
It's really hard to find places that play old school, good songs and that's why I don't typically like clubs. The Roxy does not disappoint - 70s and 80s classic rock, 90s alt and various bands, plus only the best pop of today. It is the only place where I feel like I can dance how I want too. 10/10",2017-05-09T20:16:06Z,120
55,The Roxy,3.5,"Ah The Roxy it may be a Vancouver institution but so is the corner of Hastings & Main. A place that defies time and yes taste. But to experience this Land that Taste Forgot you must pay $15 bucks then you can enter the den of 1990 but with 2020 prices!!
 You will first notice the smell, it is a mix of Axe body spray, shame and stale overpriced beer. Sure everyone should experience this place once maybe twice depending on your drunkenness and need to possibly catch a STD or maybe Ebola. Can you have fun here sure but should you?",2011-03-20T23:09:13Z,120
56,The Roxy,3.5,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed the Roxy yet. 

I'm not sure why but the Roxy appears to be everyone's secret shame. Everyone rants and wails about how they hate the Roxy and swear locusts will have to swarm the city before they ever go there but once you get a beer in them everyone breaks down and admits they love it there. 

Well, if they are closeted I'm out living in the sunshine and I'm loving it! I have three words for the Roxy: A. MAY .ZING. 

The reason everyone loves it here, and why I love it here, is I'm not sure anyone has EVER had a bad time at the Roxy. But I digress, lets get the worst of it out of the way right now...the line. 

The dreaded line. It may as well go all the way across the Granville bridge some nights and I can see the tear rolling down your cheek when it comes into your view. I'd have more sympathy for you but you showed up at 10 and didn't put yourself on the guest lists did you? Sympathy revoked! 

The Roxy is the Roxy because there is an amazing mix of everyone from Vancouver in one place, which means that everyone is going there. Which means, unlike the rest of the Vancouver nightlife scene which doesn't get going till at least 11, this is hoping by 9pm. Please pay close attention to that little word there ""BY"" 9pm. If you're not in line by 9pm or are on the guest list or know someone personally you're done for. Like anywhere else that is a Vancouver institution, its busy and you have to plan ahead. 

OK, so you worked it out, you emailed in advance for the guest list (give yourself 3 weeks in advance for Saturdays), you got through the line in an easy 30 minutes or less, you paid your cover, they swiped your ID and you're in! 

Success! 

There is a coat check in the back but not open until 10pm so don't worry about it. Now drinks are priced the same as any other place in Vancouver so don't act surprised when a beer is $6. But the bartenders are ridiculously friendly and helpful. Don't forget not to get jammed up on the bar at the door either, there are 6 more places to get drinks: To the left of the door is a beer stand, take a heavy right handed U-turn to end up at the other front bar, go straight back to the rear bar, get your beer at coat check, yet another beer stand by the woman's washroom, or find your way into the little extra room in the back to yet another bar. 7 easy ways to get drinks! 

Depending on the night and the rotation you'll get one or the other of the house bands. Both of them do cover songs that everybody loves from current tunes to oldies. Between sets the DJ does a great job in keeping everyone lively. The dance floor is small and intimate and always packed so you never feel out of place. 

Don't feel like dancing? There are two pool tables, one in the front and one in the back room. There are also some tables and booths along the wall as well as a little lounge area in the back if you want to get out of the middle of things for a little while and chat someone up. 

And then above and beyond, the reason this place is amazing, it attracts everyone from celebrities to college kids and everyone in between. No one is too old and no one with a legit ID is too young. No such thing as rich or poor, everyone mingles and plays nice. You're almost guaranteed to meet awesome people, a Canuck or two and maybe some visiting stars. 

Every day of the week has a live band, with local up and coming bands usually playing early on Tuesday and Wednesdays, with the house band and DJ coming on after, so for those of you who don't have weekends off, this is a great place for midweek partying. 

Watch out for annual events like the graffiti party, where everyone gets a white tshirt and a sharpie, their anniversary party, or just Halloween and new years. Always a destination. Always mind blowing.

I honestly hope to see you there.",2009-08-25T23:25:12Z,120
57,The Roxy,3.5,"This podunk place was more hyped up to me than Halle Berry's nude scene in Swordfish - i.e., I would have been better off staying home and whacking it to KCal 9's weather girl. 

It's a bar, ok... A bar with a 5 dollar cover and a shitty cowboy band? Umm, this type of shit gets people off in Canada? Still, I am a simple guy; when forced into a shitty situation, I can usually drink my way out of it. But wow, wow.... A Jameson on the rocks is a perfectly poured one ounce shot of whiskey over ice? So to then get a normal American pour, I have to ask for a triple at 15 dollars? Luckily they have free health care here, because if I had to pay those prices on a regular basis you better be damn sure that the morphine drip is free when I fake a hemorrhage.

Oh yeah, later in the night all the chicks freaked out because some scrub 4th liner from the Canucks showed up. To my fellow Americans; picture Adam Morrison of the Lakers showing up to a bar and the people there actually giving a shit, let alone have him sign a titty. 

I'll pass on this place next time I'm in Vancouver.",2011-11-03T08:00:00Z,120
58,The Roxy,3.5,"Had a great time here. Place is pretty busy but I had no issues while inside. Band played mostly covers but I don't think anyone really cares. The atmosphere is nice and hazy, and the bar tenders were very nice to my surprise. 

I guess I'll say the inside is a bit smaller than it looks and the dance floor can't hold that many people,  but does anyone honestly care about that? I don't know.",2014-10-21T19:13:14Z,120
59,The Roxy,3.5,"Same story for years, but apparently it works. Packed wall-to-wall with Caucasians, of the Canuck fan variety and with a good lookin' mix of peeps, this place continues its legacy as the busiest bar along the Strip. 

It's all about its rep and the crowd here. Otherwise, I don't get the appeal. It smells BAD. It's got that sweaty feeling. It's super run-down. Service is meh. Washrooms are meh. Music is a live band alternated with top 40, and the live music is good, but the band plays the same music every week (classic hits over the decade that everyone knows). The experience has been the exact same each time I've come for the past 3 years, and I've come a lot. I've never been a fan, but my North Van friends always tend to migrate to The Roxy... sigh ... but I will give it to them. They do have a good system in place. And if this is your scene, you will have a wicked time.",2011-12-04T11:33:01Z,120
60,The Roxy,3.5,"It has been over 12 years since I have been at the Roxy and I had a great time.  I can't believe I am saying this but the $13 cover last Friday seemed like good value! The house band played a variety of pop tune covers from the last 20 years and the age range was 25-65, no kidding.  Dress how you will, just be clean.

$6 beers and we waited only 5 minutes in line even though our group of 9 arrived at 9:30 pm.  By midnight, it was packed like sardines but, we had our fill and were ready to leave because we are old.

Of course it is too loud, of course it is rundown and out-of-date, of course there are oafish drunks in the crowd.  What kind of place do you think you are going to?  This is The Roxy for crying out loud!",2013-12-15T03:38:07Z,120

62,The Roxy,3.5,"Say what you will about the Roxy, it's still one of the least pretentious and most fun clubs in Vancouver.

Granted the crowd has a very odd distribution. There's a lot of barely legals, but also a lot of cougars on the prowl. The band looks like they've seen better days, but always amp up the crowd with some classic rock. 

If you like to classic rock, like the feel of a pub as opposed to a slick nightclub, and like to get a little messy in public, this one's for you.

Now the con's: Last time I was here, a bartender was so unbelievably rude, that he made my friend cry. She asked for a glass of water and I kid you not he turned to her and said, ""Get the f*** away from my bar or I'll kick you the f*** out of here."" I complained to the management but they didn't really seem to care too much. So definite points off there.

Aside from the incredibly rude staff though, this place was a lot of fun and a great place to get a little rowdy on the Granville Strip. Despite the abundance of clubs on the strip - that's a big accomplishment. Props to ya Roxy.",2011-06-21T17:44:00Z,120
63,The Roxy,3.5,"Extremely rude barstaff that think they're better then everyone else while the bouncers care more about roughing somebody up then being there for somebody's safety.

But it's fun - surprisingly, A LOT of fun. The key I believe is to be very, very drunk. 

With my group, there's never a plan to come to The Roxy. It's where we end up. We usually start off at nicer establishments, knock back many a drink, and on the nights that we can realllllyyy feel the drunk kicking in - we head here. Being wasted in a nice establishment is no good, but at The Roxy it is simply a means to some very good times. 

Come with very low expectations and a dozen or so shots in your belly for the best chance at having yourself a messy, but very fun night.",2012-01-10T02:37:19Z,120
65,The Roxy,3.5,"I came here at the insistence of my roommate for her friend's birthday. 

I'm glad we got in for free because otherwise, I would never come here. I have no intention of coming back.

The floorplan isn't the best. The dance area gets really cramped REALLY fast, to the point where you can't even bounce in time to the music while standing in one spot. Sardines have more breathing room. There is no traffic flow in the walkway areas, primarily because drunk people just stand there talking, oblivious to the people trying to get around them. 

I had the unfortunate experience of numerous people touching me and also pulling my hair while I tried to maneuver the crowd. As a woman, you expect a certain amount of creepy crowd touching but this was too much. There are guys who just stand in the walkways and molest the blackout drunk chicks who are trying to get to the bathroom.

And speaking of the women's washroom, that's another place where people seem to think it's okay to just stand around. I understand that ladies like to preen but the Roxy's womens restroom is simply not built for that. 

I know that drunk people standing in the way or creepy crowd touching isn't directly the fault of the Roxy but it's worth noting.

What earned the Roxy two stars instead of one is the fact that the live band played ""Howlin' For You"" by the Black Keys. That is all.",2012-10-21T10:47:58Z,120
66,The Roxy,3.5,"It's just the worst place to spend your night at. They are very rude and the bartenders suck! 

We went there for my friend's birthday and I the bar was pretty busy, and I was trying to get bartender's attention to buy a drink for my friend, and the bartender came to me and started yelling at me that there are so many people before me (ok, fair enough, but why do you yell?) and then he called me ""BITCH""! I could not believe it! cause I wasn't even rude or drunk or anything... I told the manager, he was kind enough to buy me a drink but he was basically laughing! I do not understand this people, if you are not prepared to service a busy bar, why do you even work, and call your costumer a bitch??? it is just so disrespectful and unacceptable. I mean can you believe it?

And it is not only this bartender, the other ones were very rude too. I saw them giving free drinks to girls, but when i asked for special drink (not even free) for my friend, who is a guy, they yelled back no FREE drinks! WTH!
I would never recommend going to this place... we should show them that costumer service and giving a good experience should be their priority!",2012-03-14T19:38:52Z,120

68,The Roxy,3.5,"This place was not a hit for me. We stopped in during a recent visit to Vancouver and it was so stale. The vibe was just off: bad music, bad lighting, weak mixed drinks.. 

I could go on, but I think I've said everything that needs to be said, in two sentences. The bright lights on the sign are attractive, yet the interior is anything but! We wandered down the street a few blocks and ended up a The Morrisey Pub, which was much more our flavor. There are plenty of watering holes in Vancouver.

Drinks were good and the bar has a relaxed, unconsciously cool vibe that automatically makes you feel at home. I think this is helped by the slightly grungy exterior which seems to repel men with wandering eyes and gropey hands, and women in short black dresses and too much make up. The live band was awesome and my friend and I had a great time dancing and singing along to some classic cover songs. It was one of my ""costume nights"" but the Roxy clientele base didn't seem to mind that I was decked out in suspenders and some odd assortment of other clothing. 

I had a great time that night and return visits have reassured me that the Roxy is a great place to go when there just isn't anywhere else to go. I now consider it the ""Cheers"" of the downtown Vancouver nightclub scene.",2010-08-05T19:57:32Z,120

76,The Roxy,3.5,"Are there better clubs?
sure there are.
but no bar/club provides a consistently good time like the Roxy.
I'm still amazed that the Roxy gets lineups almost every night of the week.

The bartenders are just a nice crowd that have always been prompt, the crowd is a crapshoot- as I get older the crowd remains to stay young...I think that this may be a sign that I should stop going.  But in a bind, it's a good ""regulars place"".

It also seems to attract a bit of a suburban party crowd.  take that for what you will.

There's always a good mix of annoying to not so annoying characters that are worth sifting through.  what I generally like is that amongst the characters available there will always be a good small crowd of people who don't mind starting off the dance floor- which is nice because I generally dislike the way people are too cool for skool here and stand around the dance floor to glare at other people.

79,The Roxy,3.5,"This is easily one of the best places in Vancouver to drink way too much and party.  

It's always very crowded, from Fridays to Sundays.  The Roxy has pretty good weekdays too. Along with Republic, I think they're the only clubs on Granville that keep open 7 nights a week.  So if you're looking to get slammed on a Tuesday, The Roxy is a decent bet.    

The crowd is a solid mix of young and old, but there's definitely way more people 35+ than at the other nightclubs around the area.  The people here are definitely in a big party mood on weekends, and dress ranges from casual to the usual Vancouver club attire.  

The bartenders are decent, but the fastest ones tend to work the smaller room in the far back.  The bouncers here are some of the nicest on Granville, always polite and friendly.  Surprising, since every time I've been here I've seen a fight break out, so they're definitely busier than at the other clubs around Vancouver.  It definitely gets rowdy, but it goes along with the big party vibe they have here on weekends.  The ""drunk level"" is definitely highest here out of all the clubs on the Granville strip.     

There's live music, so if you'd rather a DJ that plays Top 40 or EDM, then Caprice, Republic and Venue are better choices.   Country music night on Sundays would be the best night to go to the Roxy, or what my friends affectionately call ""Cougar night.""

I was in town for a work trip and he tagged along, found this gem the night before and said we absolutely had to go back. We were there around 10ish and the line wasn't bad at all. I don't remember a cover or not but if there was one it was likely nominal. The space was huge and so was the dance floor. It was completely packed but not very hard to get a drink, service was fast. The best part was the music. The cover bands were EPIC. Seriously, they played an amazing mix of current hits, 90's pop hits and rock. They could play any song, seriously, they were amazingly talented. If I come back to Vancouver The Roxy is on my list of places I must go again!",2016-05-11T21:36:40Z,120

Though I'm no barstar, I appreciate the live cover bands, casual vibe and diverse crowd. When you're with a gaggle of girls It's not hard to be invited onstage (maids of honour, take note) or to meet local sports celebs.",2010-12-27T06:59:42Z,120

Long story short - woke up hurting the next morning with fake tattoos on my boobs and very little recollection of the night... But here are the salient points - cover sucks, but as girls, we had no trouble getting round after round bought for us, so ultimately not an expensive night. We drank, we danced, we got phone numbers... definitely not the kind of place you want to go for a quiet night, and it wouldn't be very fun if you aren't single, but a great go-to place to get hammered and meet people.

There was a line to get in, even at the ungodly hour of 9 PM (ha!) but we kept ourselves entertained talking to the crazy girls in the line up with us. Once inside we found a table for our group and got a few drinks. There was a cover band as well as a DJ and the music was a mix of 80's, 90's and current top 40. We danced a lot, drank even more and had a pretty good time!

This isn't the type of place I would normally come to, but it's not what was described to me. I was expecting something rowdy and sleazy but it was just a normal place. Probably (I can't really say from experience though) one of the less jackass filled places on Granville? No one was super dressed up and we didn't run into any douche bags. 

I'd go again if someone suggested it, but I probably wouldn't bring up the idea myself haha.",2010-12-27T19:18:18Z,120

Cover is a little steep and it does get super crowded, and don't get me started on the nasty bathrooms- so if any of those things get your goat, perhaps you should avoid this Vancouver staple.

On the plus side, the bands are great, and country night (Sundays) is always out of this world fun (even my country-music-hating friends have a good time). The bartenders are pretty good too, even if you have to wait a long time to get a drink.

Also, it cost $13 to get in and listen to bad covers of songs you wish you didn't have to hear for the hundredth time and make sure the 50 year old men eyeing you from across the room leave. People actually started dancing when the band stopped and the DJ playlist began playing. I suppose it's a landmark though. Lots of different kinds of people end up here, so it's nice to have a variety of strangers to talk to. Still, I go to bars to get drunk, not hydrated. 2 stars.",2016-01-03T20:31:03Z,120
90,The Roxy,3.5,"Guys... this place is soooo fun! It looks a little dodgy on the outside but seriously, the vibe inside makes up for it. Went here on a Friday night. Didn't show up here till 12:45am and stayed till 2:30. It. Was. A. Blast! 

I would definitely go back and recommend this place. The bouncers let us in free of cover because he saw that my two friends with me, birthdays were coming up so he let us all in with no cover charge! 

The live music is on point. They do covers to songs but it sounded incredible and just made for a fantastic time!",2014-11-14T21:31:55Z,120
91,The Roxy,3.5,"Waking up with a couple mysterious bruises and a headache is getting off easy if you ended up at the Roxy last night. The Roxy never seems to be the desired spot to hit when you go out. It's more the place where you end up after you drank too much at a few other places. If you say to a Vancouverite ""I was at the Roxy last night,"" they can pretty much fill in the blanks.

It's busy every night of the week, and there's usually a live band playing. The crowd is mixed, from business people on a bender with coworkers to college attendees, I even heard the Canucks like to party at the Roxy.

You leave with a huge smile and the next day you think you had a good time ... but you can't quite remember why.",2008-11-28T22:03:36Z,120
92,The Roxy,3.5,"I went here for my birthday party on a Saturday night having never been there and was surprised at how not horrible it was. 

The inside is nothing like I expected and I kinda like it in there, the music was good, unusual that they play pop music while the ""rock"" band rests but I like both and don't really care what's playing once I am liquored.

What I don't like is you have to be there oddly early to get in without a really long wait.",2011-12-21T05:25:20Z,120

We had hoped that in waiting the two hours in line we could gain entry. At 12:20 after waiting more than two hours we left. I definitely won't recommend this club to anyone, very unprofessional conduct. That will be our first and LAST time at the roxy.",2015-12-03T08:50:03Z,120
94,The Roxy,3.5,"The Roxy; a ""staple"" of Vancouver's night life. The lack of gay males was abhorrent. Only one was there and he looked lonely dancing at the table with his girlfriends. They even dared to water down the drink. Gimini Christmas, really? You need to water down the drinks even with a 13 dollar cover charge. I am sure that is against the law. The only upside I found to this place was the company and friendship of a young college fellow. He was up visiting with his girlfriend, who passed out earlier in the night, and was drinking alone at the bar. My girlfriend and I started to make conversation and within the minute he offered to buy us a drink. By the end of our interaction we had 4 jaeger bombs each with him. He was a true gentleman. If a guy like him enjoys The Roxy I'm sure there is something good about this place, thus a two star review has been given. Goodnight and good luck.",2016-01-03T20:37:26Z,120
95,The Roxy,3.5,"So this place is awesome. The atmosphere is very friendly, and a great party from the time you walk in to the time you leave. The line wasn't too long, and the wait for a drink wasn't to long. The live music was great and the music that they platyed when the band wasn't playing was really good.
The overall quality of the facility was good. It was straight brick and seemed a little run down but it added to the atmosphere because it wasn't dirty or anything.
The crowd of people at this club was great. A nice mix of people but i couldn't help but notice how many people looked like they were twenty years older than me. Just a little past their clubbing days.
Overall a great experience.",2010-06-21T06:12:39Z,120
96,The Roxy,3.5,"I went to Vancouver on business trip and my client took me to a nice bar at first. Then we continued to drink at the Roxy where we had a great time. The bartenders were great and there was a great dance ambiance. Unfortunately not all the staff was that nice. A bartender who would only give shots to 20 year old girls refused to sell a shot to my client. After that, security came to ask my client to leave. They were actually nice when asking but the fact that the bartender would ask to have someone get kicked out from the bar for asking for a girly shot is really unsettling. Other than that, we had a great time. But the fact that the misogynist bartender had so much power is very sketchy. I would not go back unless I know I can be safe in there.",2015-03-17T08:46:55Z,120

The patrons range from people who just got their ID to people who are old enough to be your grandparents. If this doesn't turn you off, then prepare to have an awesome time... roadhouse style. This is an old school meat market. So if you don't like to get hit on, this is not the place for you. Dance at home. The bouncers and bartenders here are the best. Friendly and professional.

So I had a bartender that I was/still am obsessed with. She was super helpful and attentive. Not to mention SUPER ATTRACTIVE. She kept my friends and I well ""juiced"" and just added to my experience altogether. I would come again for her. So  I don't remember her name because me memory is terrible and I don't know where my receipts are, but it started with a J. Jess? Jen? (she has a ton of tattooss, a tonnnnnnnnnn) But she was great.
The club played uhm i would say mainly 90s hits? Not bad. My friends and I had a god time. Luckily we didn't have to wait in a line, so that was cool. We got there around 11something i believe... 
I like the fact that there are couches so I can sit my lazy self down.. Pretty solid crowd. Didn't have to use the bathroom but my friends did and had no complaints.",2019-04-04T16:12:36Z,97

When I went to pick it up, one of the bouncer Sam said it was no where to be found in the lost and found phone container which was very stressful because it did say that it was detected at Fortune.

He allowed me to go with him to search for it. We were looking everywhere around the club and by the end of it we found my phone near some the other lost and found items. Though it did take me 2 days to get my phone back, I am glad Sam was very kind and understanding and I wouldn't have been able to find my phone if I didn't have his help.",2023-02-25T07:59:34Z,97
108,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"19 year old me would be so disappointed to hear me say that clubbing isn't my scene anymore. But, it's true. It really isn't. But the difference between Fortune and many other clubs in Vancouver is that I don't really ever feel like I'm going to your typical club. I feel like I'm going to a fun concert and show venue. 

The venue is spacious - the main stage is set up right in the front, dance floor close by, VIP tables off to the side, and three or four different bars scattered around. Service has always been fantastic - I never feel like I've had to wait too long to get the bartender's attention for a drink... and I'm not just saying that because I'm a lady. I'm saying that because the bartenders and staff at Fortune are organized, well-staffed and efficient. So, kudos to them.

Sidenote: did you know that they have a karaoke room in the back? Yeah, I didn't till recently. Game changer. 

The sound system is killer, the drinks are always flowing, the atmosphere is fun and lively, the staff are awesome... what else more could you want for a club?

Cheers for all the fun nights, Fortune!",2018-05-19T23:32:32Z,97
109,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"Last weekend a friend and myself went into fortune after an event at a business across the street. We got in promptly - which was nice! 
Unfortunately this is where things went downhill. we walked to the back bar (which had no line) and there were two servers behind the bar. They were having a conversation so I patiently waited. They continued to talk while we were standing there so I eventually interrupted and said ""hi"". 
The server ignored me and continued to talk until she was finished, then took my order and snapped at me the whole time. 
As I was walking away I heard her tell her coworker ""that girl was such a c*nt"" 
I turned around and told her that, no, I wasn't being a ""c*nt"" - I just wanted a drink."" 

I didn't appreciate this kind of attitude and it ruined the rest of my evening, I left right after that drink. 

Other than that, the music is great and the atmosphere is exciting.",2018-10-13T00:53:22Z,97
110,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"This cover thing in Vancouver is real! $18-$20 is typical for a Saturday night? I don't need to kick it thaaaaaaaat bad, but If I'm driving 4 hours to get to the city I might as well end it getting active somewhere. LOL

The other reviews are accurate; this is where you go for some ratchet music and some ratchet people.  Lots of young, 20-something-year-olds who act hella sloppy (spill drinks and bump into you because they can't hold their liquor).  I guess now that I'm 30 (*insert crying emoji*) this is the type of shit I really notice. LOL

The music though; I can fuck with! Lots of the most popular hip hop music in rotation; from trap to the more pop shit, all of which you can definitely dance to.

This is obviously the best, if not the only option for a hip hop head in Vancouver if you want to get lit or whatevaaa. LOL",2017-09-06T22:49:37Z,97
111,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"I had been here a couple of times before for music shows. It is a good venue for dance type music. However, last night I and a friend stopped by here for a show and equally felt disappointed.

First of all, the opening music was not great. Then, Basia Bulat came on stage, and we couldn't see her because of the layout of the venue. It's long and narrow without much sloping in the floor. Also, the acoustics were not great; they seemed a little muffled. I'm saying that based on experience and having been to many music shows at various Venues. 

Further, the drink options were disappointing. They had only a couple beer options that I was interested in and they did not have much at all for wines...only one white (Viognier) which I do not like, and no reds. I know it's not about the drinks, but you still wanna sip on something enjoyable during a show.

I think I would not see another show here when there are many other options in town.",2016-02-27T00:18:18Z,97
112,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"My girlfriend and I came to Vancouver for a little vacation from California and we were looking to see what the nightlife was all about on a Friday. We both like to dance to hip hop or ""ratchet"" music and FSC delivered. They played the music you would want to hear to get loose and party too.

The vibe and atmosphere was great. Theres a lot of mixed crowds and everyone had the same objective, to have fun. The dance floor is small and gets pretty packed which causes you to maneuver through people but that is pretty much expected at any dance bar or club.

Definitely would recommend to anyone from out of town who loves to ""turn up!""",2017-06-17T15:15:49Z,97
113,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"Not just your average night club. An incredible atmosphere that continually brings top artists that are sure to exceed your expectations and keep you dancing all night. They are also AMAZING to partner with for a variety of events. Having worked with many of their staff, I am continually blown away at how they are eager to bring your vision to life and assist in making your event a huge success. Thank you for many memorable nights Fortune!",2018-01-23T04:44:46Z,97
114,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"I went to the Fortune Sound Club for a special event.

I got there early, so I had to wait a bit for them to set up.  A few minutes passed after the starting time, and lots of strange people were wandering the streets at that time.  Some people were smoking various things, all of which were not pleasant.

The wait was about 20 minutes after the start time.  The staff inside were a lot friendlier than the bouncers (for obvious reasons), and I proceeded inside.

Earlier in the night, there were only a few people, the crowd started to come in 2 hours after the event start time.  There was still music and drinks, but it was dark, noisy, and empty.

When more people came, it was the typical club scene--there was ""dancing"", bumping, and top 50 ""music"".  (However I'm sure the music depends on the event you attend.)

My friend said that they spent around $60 dollars on drinks (for 4 to 6 of them, I can't say).  There's a lounge area in the back, with a few seats, a bar, and the dance floor. The main speakers are in front, so it's best to avoid being in the very front.  Most of the people in the club danced in a rectangular area in front of the speakers, avoiding the sides and the back.

If you're into clubbing--the dimly lit rooms with blasting music, strobe lights, people bumping into you, and shouting to be understood, then sure.  If you don't club, and clubbing doesn't appeal to you, you might spend the night trying to sleep but you can't because your nerves are overstimulated (that's what happened to me).

The staff here are pretty friendly, the drinks look good, the place is tidy, the washrooms need a bit of work (a broken faucet here and there).  

So that's my experience; it's just your typical club, but in Chinatown.",2018-05-01T21:25:56Z,97
115,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"I had my first and last experience at Fortune Sound club. This is a bit of a delayed review from last year, however, reviewed none the less. I am confident things have changed since. I was there assisting my friend on the DJ tables and what made the evening horrible was the attitude of the staff who need to get their heads out of their ass. Than again this seems to be everywhere in Vancouver with bouncers etc. with the exception of the Commodore Ballroom. The guy at the door wanted to kick me out 'cause I wasn't ""dressed properly."" He was quickly embarrassed when I mentioned that I was with the DJ and the outfit he was snuffing out was a $300 Marc Vachon jacket...a lot more expensive and stylish than the the majority of the Ed Hardy D-bags that flooded the night at the club. The only people that were nice to me where the other competing DJ's at the show case. This place is located in China town = not a good hood in general. Props to the sound system which makes DJ music sound amazing.",2012-10-29T20:04:56Z,97

117,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"Worst service I have received in a long time, and a forced money grab at the same time! I was so excited to go see my favorite band play at this club I've never been to and I had only been in the place for maybe 10 before I was speaking with a manager. 
Being a fairly cold time of year, I wore my jacket but made sure that I brought along with me the least amount of things to carry as I figured I would be carrying my jacket during the show. Little did I know that carrying a jacket is forbidden at fortune sound club. Now I've been to clubs before that do force mandatory coat checks but they charge by donation and can usually accommodate paying show customers by putting two jackets on one hanger, ect, so I asked the security guard as he was 'herding' us into the coat check line how much it would cost and if for the price of one we could get all jackets together (all jackets being myself and two girlfriends) and he said he had seen them do it before and it shouldn't be a problem..
Oh but it was. The girl looked at me as if I was asking some crazy request to place two fairly small jackets (my one girlfriend decided to stuff her jacket into her purse so she wouldn't have to pay coat check) on the same hanger. Her tone left me with such distaste that I asked to speak with her manager who apparently was working coat check with her and she had even more additude toward me.
I eventually became so frustrated with the lack of understanding or co-operation or even genuine niceness that I gave up. 
I had bought 3 tickets to that show running at $20 per ticket, add $3 per jacket for no good reason... How bout u just put up a sign that says hey, while ur here we're gonna steal ur lunch money too... 
I will never go back to fortune sound club, good system or not, until they get their whole staff on the same page and stop charging for ridiculous reason. 
That's my two cents",2012-03-14T08:44:04Z,97
118,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"We went here on 4th of July weekend while visiting that beautiful city that is Vancouver from Seattle. We've lived in Seattle for a couple of years now and are bummed about the lack of good dancing venues. We read reviews online and saw that Fortune was the place to go in Vancouver. We're so glad we did! We arrived pretty early (OK, we were the first ones there) but this is our preference because we like to find a good spot on the dance floor and stay there. This club features different guest djs and events weekly, this time it was the ""other guys"" event with funk, jazzy, mixes in the large room. To be honest, we didnt even like the music there, but there was a smaller (and I mean small) room that opened up at 12am. This room played a mix of everything! I heard some GREAT old school stuff from Saadiq to Badu to some old school reggae. We loved the way that the songs were all mixed up! We had a blast and stayed until the club closed! 
So, check out the nightly event, see if you'll be into the music and be prepared to pay quite a high cover charge ($15). But also be prepared to have a great time with a great crowd of friendly Canadians!",2011-07-07T17:42:05Z,97
119,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"April 14 Saturday at Fortune, this club held a show called ""Wiggles"" One of the best shows I've seen in a long time. However, the DJ afterwards wasn't that appealing. Some friends and I were really looking forward to having a good time and dancing but after the show, the DJ, Henry Mah, just played this beat music that wasn't really dancing appropriate.  I thought it was just because he can't waste the good music right at the beginning of his mix. However, we just got bored and left and came back an hour or so later and the club was pretty lonely. It was just midnight and for a Saturday, I thought that was odd. I heard great things about this club but my first time here was a downer. Sorry.",2012-04-15T09:43:57Z,97
120,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"Would be a great concert/event venue, but as a place for a fun night-out of dancing and music with a friends? Sucks. First, what I do like: spacious dance floor, good air conditioning over the dance floor, amazing sound system (THAT BASS). Customer service crew were decent. Then, what I hated: The awful, pretentious crowd that greeted me when I went for the first time on ""Happy Endings Friday"" - with all of these twentysomething bros in their snapbacks/backwards baseball hats ""leaning""  and overdone + overdressed chicks in their cliques, I knew I had just unwittingly found myself in a cesspool of of douchebags and stuck-up phonies. This was confirmed when the bartender charged me an absurd $7 for a vodka cranberry. The false advertising made the night worst - when you sell your event as a Rihanna-themed party, you should be playing more than three-four Rihanna songs in 2 hrs. Also, you should probably NOT outplay Rihanna w/ Beyonce tracks. A more accurate event description should read: ""It's Rihanna's birthday, but we're actually just going to play a lot of Hip Hop and SOME Rihanna... Hand over that $10, fu."" Unless you're at a weekday event (i.e. HHK) or booked table service, there is no space at all to sit back, chill, people-watch, and enjoy good music with your friends since the dance-floor takes up most of the square footage. The only time I'd want to come back would be for a concert or a round of HHK (where there is slightly less douchebaggery). Any other time? Nah. The Keefer is just down the street.",2015-02-24T22:17:45Z,97
121,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"If I go to a club, I like to listen to music that makes you ""ratchet"". Music was coo. I'm a hip-hop head; They played a lot of Drake (Lol). On a Saturday night cover was $20, but I had a coupon voucher for signing up on the guest list. Took off like $3 or so. 
There was a photographer there, took some photos of the people I was with. The photo turned out nice. It was edited it to the point where we didn't look drunk anymore.

I would say the only down-fall about this place was how young the crowd was. And... Not to mention, we had drinks spilled on us a couple of times; which I was not too happy about. I didn't wanna get into a fight in Canada and not be able to come back to the U.S. And it seemed like, the people there didn't have manners; I mean it's a club/ bar, but ""excuse me"" would be nice.

For sure it deserves the 4 stars I have given to this amazing place. The dance floor as it reminds me of the old ""disco"" movies. You can see the beams of light shining down from the extremely large disco ball that is hanging right in the middle of the floor. The songs they placed that night was just amazing. ""One Way or Another"" Blondie, ""Time after Time"" Cyndi Lauper, TLC ""Waterfalls"", ""I'll Make Love to You"" Boys to Men, and of course ""BABY GOT BACK"". The selection of those songs should have gotten you crazy for this place by now. Yes, even though I am the youngest  in the Yelp Elite Community, I am very pop cultured. The music choice is the best here. There is a range of ages here, from young to the late 50s here as well. I was surprised and very happy that there was a mix!! The sound system here is BOOMING loud, I loved it too! Best system! :3

The decorations here were amazing. I love how there are smaller rooms for parties which can play their own music, and then there is a smaller private bar in the back only serving our party. The bartender was hot and very nice to our party. We were totally flirting with him the whole night, and it was totally worth it! :P

The bouncer was extremely up-tight though. It happens it is Vancouver though. I was surprised they got the female to pat me down.. DID I LOOK LIKE A GIRL? LOLs. I found it extremely funny though :P The coat check ladies, extremely mean. Didn't like at all. As I did leave a ""Yelp Card"" there telling YES, YOU ARE BEING JUDGED. I did drop a tip, because I always do as well. Not going to be that mean.

Special shout out to Curtis at the back bar who wowed me with service by going out of the way to inform me of last call when I went up once to grab a drink.  I hadn't realized it was so late and he was there to make sure I had the best possible night out.  Thanks!",2016-04-05T20:50:07Z,97

Just came here for my birthday on Saturday and all off my group had the best time.
They play hip hop & rnb on these nights, which is a good change to the scene in Vancouver.

Also, excellent hospitality from the staff :)
My girls and I will be back again soon.

Friday is a much different crowd though. You would have to experience both to see what you  prefer.",2016-04-12T21:38:21Z,97
129,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"I'm sure I'm not the only one to say that most clubs really suck. Overpriced drinks, ridiculous pretentious crowd, and sh*tty music. Fortune has none of the above. It simply defines what a true club is.

Having progressed from the magical Hapa Elite party to The Pint for some more drinking and nibbles, we figured the only logical thing was to keep the party going (thanks Sara O).

To my surprise it was Hip Hop Karaoke night. If you've met me, you definitely wouldn't think hip hop, nor do I. Upon arrival, I was surprised at how busy it was, especially for a Monday.

Paid the $7 cover and headed upstairs. Cool, sample space. Pretty full with decent, non-BS people and pretty lights. And of course, their famous, mega wicked, bad-ass sound system. I'm no audiophile, but I caressed a speaker or too after hearing the beauty that came out.

Numerous performers did their best renditions of hip hop classics, with my personal fav being this one chick who simply put, was f*cking awesome! I danced (poorly) and had an absolute blast.

Seriously, seriously, check Fortune out. You'll be a believer.",2012-07-20T21:48:44Z,97

131,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"I came here with my friends for my birthday and Saturday night cover was $20. The music was fun and good for dancing, but not exceptionally better time compared to other downtown clubs with free guestlist or $10 cover. But what made me upset was the inadequate security. 

Bouncers at clubs are generally not super nice because they deal with drunk clubbers all day, but their sole job is to keep everyone safe and in control. This one guy pushed my friend's head into the wall while he was in the urinal unprovoked. Then he grabbed my friend's ass and wouldn't leave her alone. After the washroom incident, I pointed the guy out to the host and told him he assaulted my friend and to kick him out. Later, I see him again harassing my friends and I told the bouncer nearby and he had other bouncers come confirm the story. I was told by one of the employees that they found him and are now kicking him out. There was only one guy at the entire club that looked and dressed like him, and I described him several times, offered to find him with a bouncer. Then as the night progresses an hour later, I see him again and go to the bouncer once more, and yet nothing was done. 

It is completely unacceptable for him to both assault and sexually harass people in the club the way he did. He did not appear to be excessively intoxicated, but sometimes you just come across assholes. What is most upsetting is lack of action from any of the many bouncers at the club. Will not be coming back again.",2017-08-14T02:10:02Z,97

135,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"Decent space and music (mostly R&B). Crowd is on the younger side (18-22ish). Drinks are not bad. My friends and I had fun but definitely not worth the insanely high cover on a Sat night (was told that it's normally $25 but ""only"" $18 when we were there). And cash only for cover... I'll pass",2018-09-24T01:45:46Z,97
136,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"I'm really not impressed. I checked my bag in and I kept my number in my pocket for the whole night. When it was time for me to go home, turns out the number didn't match the number that my bag was tied to. I told the bag check lady that I could tell her EVERYTHING that was in my bag and I had my ID as well so that they could write my info down. She refused and said that if the number didn't match, she couldn't give it it me. I understand that you have to follow policy and what not, but I KEPT the ticket that they gave me and it turned out to be the wrong one. She said I had to wait until closing to file a lost and found complaint which was absurd to me. If I could tell her everything that was in my bag and if I had my ID with ALL my info on it, why couldn't I get my bag back? I tried talking to the people downstairs and the bouncers as well and they told me the decision went down to the bag check lady. I'm upset about the lack of understanding that was displayed to me tonight. The fact that they expected me to wait an hour and a half for closing for me to get my stuff back that would allow me to get home safe was ridiculous. I'm extremely disappointed about the way I was treated as well. Things do happen and I really did not appreciate getting talked down on and being ignored when I tried to explain my situation.

I don't know how to describe it. The feeling I had in there when I was on the dance floor all these people around dancing the music passing through my body. I just can't describe it... amazeballs. It was like the sound was grabbing my limbs and making me move my body. I remember this guy with aviator glasses on. He was soo nice. 

I think I remember seeing this other guy he was in a booth and he was wearing a shirt with led lights built into it. It was insane. Does anyone know where I can get one? PM me.",2015-04-11T19:34:23Z,97

140,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"I think I didn't want to like Fortune. There's something about brand new businesses opened by people with money infesting dilapidated East Van that I have a totally illogical, irrational feeling against. But it turns out that I really like Fortune.

I was expecting douchebag misogynists who order Grey Goose to their tables, or something, but instead I got a totally accessible venue that, despite its sleek design, is somehow comfortable for a wide variety of age groups and ""scene"" styles. I have never received bad service or felt unwelcome at this club. The bouncers and door people have been more decent to me than I think I have ever experienced consistently at any club, with perhaps the exception of the bouncer at Venue who remembers me from my ID photo every time.

I've also attended a couple of events that have been hosted at Fortune as a member of the performing group, and they are absolutely wonderful about providing beverages and refreshments backstage. Much better than other clubs I've worked events for.

Nice bathrooms, too.

142,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"My adrenaline was racing as I waited for Saturday night to come. Finally, I stepped into the doors of Fortune and walked up the stairs.

A live band was playing when I arrived. A small crowd full of men and a handful of women. 

Staff was friendly. Prices of the drinks ranged from $8.50-8.75. 

Music after the band left was awkward. The first DJ that came on after that, was awesome! Old school! But then he left and the rest of the night was all house music. If you're not intoxicated enough to listen to house, you're not going to enjoy it! And yes...more females joined the part-ay.

Overall, without the awesome bartender at the back of the club who made me a White Orchid, I would not have enjoyed the music and the atmosphere as much. I would like to come back when I learn to enjoy house music more or perhaps when or if they play top 40 songs.",2010-09-13T19:04:59Z,97

ALL CAPS LOCK ALL THE TIME!

ALL MUSIC ALL THE TIME!

What a surprising venue this is. Seriously, Fortune has one of the best sound systems in Vancouver -- perfect for more experimental and high-energy performances like Rich Aucoin, Grimes, or any one of the *many* hip-hop shows that come through town. Every performance I've been to at Fortune feels even bigger than the recorded version (as it should). Even if I'm hanging near the back, or in the inevitable line for the bathrooms, it feels as though the speakers are *right* there. 

Also of note: the douche factor is at all time low here. The crowd is fun, loud, and high-energy. Shame on me for thinking it might be any different. Shame on me for not going all the time.",2012-04-26T23:54:53Z,97
145,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"This review is for last night. Our group got table service and it was a bust. No security or anything tending to the bottle service area. THREE people FELL through our roped area, drunk and grabbing onto our legs to get themselves up (my friend almost slipped because of this). They also knocked over the rope posts in their sloppiness, which, of course, we picked up ourselves because security wasn't around to help out. Club-goers ducked under the rope and stuffed their jackets and crap behind the back of the sofa chair in our area...while I was sitting in it. I'm sorry...AM I IN YOUR WAY? PLEASE HELP YOURSELF and hover over me. 

The music was cool. A real MC with a voice was needed though. Something about listening to hip-hop/trap music in a club and hearing a higher-toned male voice yell ""turn up!"" just didn't work. The crowd-surfing was interesting. Watched a couple guys dive in and totally eat it. 

I give our bottle service waitress the yelp awarded star. She was super cute, helpful, and hung out here and there with us. High-five, girlfriend. You bad.

We quickly finished our bottle and moved our night along elsewhere.",2013-11-09T23:14:49Z,97
146,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"Having been to multiple venues across this van-city I can now say that Fortune rates as the most consistent positive experience i've had at a club in Vancouver.  Lets break it down here.
-The sound system never disappoints (except during the occasional feedback buts that's usually because KRS-ONE  says ""TURN IT ALL THE WAY UP SOUNDMAN'
The bass can actually crush you in here on the dubstep nights. Its the only Funktion - One system in the city and the run it properly. Whereas Wrongbar in toronto has had to turn down their system because of noise complaints.

-The security are NOT ASSHOLES they treat everyone with respect unless they get out of hand. They don't power trip and they even joke with you a bit.  I have to say i don't really like being photographed everytime I go to a club but it seems this is becoming the norm because of THE ASSHOLES that have ruined it for everybody else. The real benefit for the ""smokers"" , they let you go outside and get some air not ram you into some gated packed smoking area.

-The shows they have there are the best ones in the City, except for maybe some of the W2 shows that happened before they moved locations across the street to a bunker.  I just saw KRS-ONE on tuesday and it was incredible, the show went from 8pm until 3am. Its hard to find places that don't kick you out at 1-1:30 in this city.  And when I got outside there was a jamaican lady selling Jerk Chicken Dinners for $10, a little steep but it tasted hella-good after jammin' out in that sweatbox.

Will continue to go here and will never go to Gossip ever again unless it was all of the wu-tang combined. RIP O.D.B.",2011-11-19T01:49:50Z,97
147,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"A night club in Chinatown? Is everyone there Chinese? Surprisingly it was a mixture of all types of people! We went here on Saturday night when jojoflores(Deep House) was the guest DJ and it was the best club experience since the days of Graceland, Luv-A-Fair, Red Lounge, Starfish Room, Celebrities(before the reno), and the World(pre-Granville St). Everyone at Fortune was there to have a good time and just dance! Unlike the pretentious, chumpy attitude that fills the Granville Strip every weekend, there were no negative attitudes on this night! The sound system was phenomenal, as was the size of the dance floor. The club itself was beautiful, but not over the top like the rest of the new clubs that are starting to all look the same. All staff were respectful and friendly! Drinks were good and reasonably priced. I'll definitely be coming back! 

p.s. Does anyone recognize the bartender Aaron from the old Telus commercials that were made to look like GAP ads?",2010-03-02T17:21:54Z,97
148,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"I had always heard about Fortune having a great sound system, but i never expected to end up there since whenever i've walked by it looks like a Jersey Shore party is happening without a  trace of irony. Well, during the week, Fortune rents out their space for bands, and believe it or not, it's become a venue for the occasional metal show!

As expected, the sound system was AWESOME. I usually don't pay too much attention to sound quality at shows unless it's really atrocious, but the sound was so good it was impossible not to notice! My knees were a bit sore so i went to the benches on the right of the stage to sit and noticed that the sound was just as good there as it was in the center of the room! Pretty cool.

The staff were all nice and the drinks were about how expensive as i expected they'd be. More than i like paying for drinks, but not outrageous. I was actually surprised by how little character the place had though. Aside from the cool graphics on the wall in the entry stairwell, it's very plain. No colour, no cool lighting, no art... I don't like places that are too fancy, but i do like places that have some memorable or unique qualities and this place had none!

How weird is it that they make guys get their photos taken at the door and not girls though? I asked the door girl about it and she said she found it just as confusing as i did, especially since she said over half the fights seem to be started by girls! Well, at least the misogyny seems like it could actually benefit a girl haha!",2011-07-28T07:29:21Z,97

152,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"I was at a charity fashion show, and was told that they were having an after party with the models at Fortune Night Club.

So to Fortune Night Club I went.  

I had already been drinking at the event, had a decent buzz going, so we came to the club early (the after party started at 10:30, we were there at 9:30).  The security person said that we had to come back at 10:30 or would have to pay cover.

So after wandering around the DTES, being offered drugs loudly by some random dude, and avoiding the the crack addicts losing their shit on the sidwalks, we found an interesting joint to have beers at and chill for the hour.  

At 10:30, we showed up to Fortune and there was a big line, but the security said that since we had the event tickets we could skip the line, and go right in.  Don't get why we couldn't just go in at 9:30, when they had a much larger line at 10:30.    

Also, I ordered a rum and coke, and the bartender thought I ordered 6, and gave me 6 rum and cokes.  I didn't want to get in a piss fest over who said what, so he said he'd charge me doubles (which would be cheaper), and I split the order with a friend I went with.  I wasn't happy about it though, because I ended up having way more rum and coke than I wanted.  The bartenders are way faster, make less mistakes at the clubs on some of the Granville clubs.  

I'd give the overall vibe and venue 4 stars, but wasn't happy about the drink mix-up.  I'd been here once before, a few years ago and it hasn't changed much at all, so what they're doing looks like it's working for them.  It's definitely a unique looking club, something different in the Vancity scene.  And it has an overall very friendly crowd compared to what you usually see in the more typical Vancouver club (there weren't any dudes in muscle shirts spazzing out here or 19 year-old chicks stampeding each other to get to coat check first).  

It's worth a night out at, if you want a look at something different than what you usually get in Vancouver.",2014-05-04T09:34:42Z,97

154,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"This place has only been open a few months, I'm told, and it looks amazing. It's smack in the middle of Chinatown, so they've taken a few design cues there, from the mural that runs along the entry staircase (I felt a little like I was going up to Andy's friend's funky apartment in Pretty in Pink) to the big round reddish lights at either end of the room that reminded me of the Japanese flag. 

I was there early in the night for an event, so it was very chill with DJs playing and lots of space to lounge around on the banquettes and chat. Bartenders, coat check staff, and door staff - all very nice and friendly, too. And would you look at the size of that dance floor! I'm going to have to start staying up later.

It's not just the close proximity that keeps me coming back, but it's the excellent selection of shows. I've seen a lot of techno (yes, it's still a thing) DJ's that you don't really see many other places in Vancouver, discovered some awesome local bands, been to great artsy fundraisers. All in all, Fortune Sound Club does a really good job of hosting the events that me and mine want to attend.

Honestly, I am not sure of drink prices because I only ever buy beer from the coat check lady's bin - which is about $4, not bad. 

The venue is just the right size to accommodate the shows they put on, not so big that it feels empty, not so small that it gets cramped. There's plenty of room to dance your pants off, and enough seating to rest when you and your dancypants need a break.

I like Fortune, and I'm sure I'll return often for as long as they bring in the awesome shows. Woowoo!",2012-12-21T22:23:25Z,97
158,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"Best sound system in VanCity with their FunkTion-One.  Best sound experience bar far in Vancouver.  I was the first one in their one night when it was empty and I just wanted to lie down in the middle of the dance floor and pretend it was my living room.  The sound seeps into your pores during the night.

Everyone has a different club experience depending on who they are with and what they like.  I am just describing the killer sound rig and dance experience.  The decor is kind of like a miny Commodore Ballroom.  It is warm and laid back.  Central wood dancing floor with earth tone interior.    You could wear pretty much whatever you liked.  Overabundance of hipsters and oversized Nerd glassess but peeps where chilled without a lot of tude'.  Summer of 2010 seemed to be chicks with skorts.

I like house, Drum and Bass and Dubstep.  Place is packed to the rafters when they bring in a Dubstep name...it is an unreal experience with a Dubstep master on the Funktion-One.  Similar to a modern day Stonehenge with the druids of bass whipping up the Vancity vagrants on the pillar like FunkTion-One speakers.   Literally a transcendant experience.  I have seen dancers praying to the speakers in aural ecstasy.

Only complaint is they seem to let a few underagers in on some nights.  So that is good or bad depending of what side of the gap you are looking at.",2010-08-27T03:48:35Z,97

If you want to dance, try going on a Friday. The DJ's are great and it's not top 40's. It can get really full, so be prepared to bump into a lot of people. But, if you're going on a different night, make sure you check the website first. I went on a Saturday once when they were playing more mellow music that we couldn't dance to. We stayed and listened, but it wasn't what we expected.",2012-11-26T16:48:06Z,97
160,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"Went for the Chet Faker show on May 23rd.

I remember going here back before it was Fortune... I think it was called the Rainbow Unicorn Club, or something of that nature. 

Now it's 2014 and I'm don't go to shows as much as I used/like to. Call me an old man if you wish, I call myself ""Mr. Fiscal Responsibility."" Luckily I got tickets as a bday present, so time to let loose!

The venue is a nice space. It's long and square with a main and back bar. It's terraced so those choosing not to be in the front row actually have a decent view of the stage. 

As mentioned previously, the sound system is FANTASTIC! It sounds so beautiful and loud, without being too loud. I can see why electronic and hip-hop artists frequent this place, the lows are low and the highs are refreshingly high. As an audiophile, I really appreciate the amount of care that went into it.

Drinks are standard, if not pricey. Two Gin & Tonics were $14.00... Having a few of those set me shrunk my wallet quickly. 

Chet Faker was an early show, and by the end of the set the crowd/audience was quite loud and rowdy. I felt like those who arrive to get their sweat on came around 10p.m. while he was performing... a bit rude but a great show nonetheless.",2014-05-27T17:10:32Z,97
161,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"This location is great because it's away from the Granville strip and busy parts of downtown Vancouver.  Meaning, it's easier to find parking here (if you're driving).   But if you prefer to be in the downtown core, then maybe it's not ideal.

The people working here from the bouncers, to coat check, to bar staff were all super friendly.  There were no creepy guys trying to grind with you.  Always a plus. The music was danceable and it wasn't your typical hip hop style of music on a Friday night.  

However, I like dancing to hip hop music.  I would have been happier if they had included a little bit of it in to the mix.  (Are there nights they play  mostly hip hop?).  They were a bit slow getting back to me with the guest list so I wasn't aware of what time to arrive until the day of. But by then I wasn't able to notify my friends. 

I was slightly put off by the $15 cover... but is that the going rate these days? I don't even know.  Honey charges $10.  Then they had a mandatory coat check for $3.  So basically, if you brought a coat, the bare minimum it costs to dance here is $18.  That is a little ridiculous.  Drinks were $6.75 for singles, and $8.75 doubles. 

So overall, I thought Fortune was okay.  I found it to be a pretentiously priced, and the music was okay for dancing to, but we didn't have a blast.",2010-06-28T23:28:11Z,97
162,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"There are few reasons why night crawlers would stand in the cold and migrate towards Chinatown in the evenings ... but it is worth going ""For Tune."" ;)

The music. Always decent - good deep house, dub DJs for special events and old school beats in the back sound room. 

The sound. This is the big home hitter, as I'm sure you've read. You know the sound is good when it fills the whole club and you can still speak to a friend beside you without yelling. 

The crowd. Very chill and random, but with lots of urban hipsters sportin' the skinnies and funky glasses. It's also become younger since it opened. 

What's more:
- Great review on here by Johnson C.
- It would be awesome if Fortune brought in some international house or more deep house DJs (like Morgan Page, Glenn Morrison, Marques Wyatt). It's such a great venue for performances!",2011-10-02T03:36:06Z,97
163,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"First time going clubbing, worse experience ever. I was told the max price for cover would be $18, but when I went up to the cashier to pay it somehow raised up to $25. Since I was already there, I decided to just go in and try it out. I HATED the music! ALL THE GOOD SONGS WERE CUT SHORT and all the songs I didn't know felt like it was going on forever. Long story short, I do not recommend this club.",2018-09-07T07:08:51Z,97
164,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"Argh...I want to like this place. I do...because clubbing is super subjective, I want to appreciate it for what it is, and not how I feel about it. So, a 3 is being generous, and that's because of the sound system. Quick caveat, I hate hip-hop.

Went to this as an after party after an elite event a few weeks ago. As usual, we were looking for a place to continue the Yelp awesomeness. We went here on the suggestion of a friend that it had great dancing and music. Well, there was definitely enough space to dance. The place is quite large and I didn't have to fight my way through a crowd. Granted, it was a Monday night....but the place IS big. As everybody else has mentioned, the sound system is great. Probably can't be beat.

My biggest problem however is the cash bar. I mean, come on. That's ridiculous in this era, when most people carry around their debit cards. In fact, I can count on one hand the amount of times I actually carry cash, and that's usually only for emergencies. Besides, it's in their best interest to allow tabs/credit cards because then I'll drink more!

The other problem was the crowd...I mean, there really wasn't any decent dancing to be had...however, the guys for the most part were respectful enough. No groping, nothing that warranted a kick in certain places.

Best part of the night was one of the chicks that got up on stage for the ""karaoke"" portion. She was amazing...wish I knew who she was, or could remember what she sang...

Anyway, if you're into hip-hop, this is probably the best that you can do. If you're looking to dance to some decent music, this isn't the place.",2012-07-28T11:14:26Z,97

166,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"I've been here twice now on a Friday night, and while I agree that the sound system is amazing, I thought the music was just ""OK"" and not as danceable as at other clubs. But they probably have a very different selection of music on different nights...
The not-so-great features of Fortune are the pricey drinks, pricey cover even if you're on the guest list (this gets a mixed review because both times I was on the guest list; I had to pay cover the first time but not the second) and slightly sketchy location (off the Granville strip, yes, but not the ideal spot if you're taking public transit etc. alone at night as a single female).
The great features of fortune are the atmosphere, the relative lack of sketchy characters invading your personal space and the friendly bartending /bouncer staff. Fun times!",2010-09-04T16:25:59Z,97

The club layout is nice and the sound is great. The Funktion One speakers stand out from the rest and are the focal point of the room framing the stage.

 Their beer selection is impressive (Parallel 49 Lager, Gypsy Tears, Four Winds IPA, Bomber IPA, Bomber Pilsner, Heineken, Redstipe, Red Truck Lager, Sol, Canadian, MGD, Coors Light, Coors Banquet, PBR, Cariboo). It was nice to have many options in terms of price and selection. 

I have been to some other Clubs in Vancouver who have Grey Goose in their well and charge $13 dollars an ounce.....

The shows are popping and the atmosphere was great the last few times I visited. Overall a nice change from the Typical local club scene.",2016-03-18T06:07:32Z,97

172,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,This place sucks. POOPDICK. Horrible. If they cancel on a contract that implies bad business skills. Pushovers and not trustworthy. Can't do business with people like this.,2016-02-11T19:15:39Z,97
173,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"If a Granville Street club procreated with one on East Hastings, Fortune Sound Club would be the resulting bundle of joy.  It's got the hook-up/creep factor only Granville Street can provide and the unpretentious/hippsterly dressed crowd often found slouching against the walls of a dive bar.  In other words, this place is one big contradiction.  BUT, as many would say, that is its selling point.

1. I've only been to Fortune twice and both times I never had to wait in line BUT that also means the club was kinda empty.  I like it that way but many don't so hold tight because literally in the blink of an eye it gets packed - usually after midnight.

2. The atmosphere is very chill and I'm 99.9% sure you can get away wearing a garbage bag because I saw someone wearing sweats and a full-on tracksuit BUT there are people looking to hook up everywhere!  You can feel their eyes scanning the room.  Once my friends and I got there at 10:00pm and everyone was already coupled up - it got pretty messy.  As we danced they would bump into us and sometimes go right between us.  You could only laugh though - a true clubbing experience.

3. Great, a club away from the Granville strip with regular cop-checks included BUT cover and drinks is still relatively expensive.  On Fridays cover is $15 + $3 mandatory coat check. 

4. The music permeates from the walls and the beats are pretty good BUT some are un-danceable and if you're the type to yell ""I LOVE THIS SONG"" then it's safe to say your voice will be in full tact the next day and you'll be disappointed.  The great thing is that the minute you start thinking ""this song is so long"" the DJ switches it.  

I gave this place 3 stars because there is a nice mixture of people, the music is good and the only downsides are the weekend prices and people creeping.",2010-09-13T20:55:47Z,97
174,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"I have to say the music was good and I can definitely see how going to fortune for a show would be a good experience.  However,  my friends and I didn't go for a show.  First off the atm wasn't working....  At 11pm. Normally I don't mind walking to a bank,  so I could kind of get over that.  

The worst part was the terrible service at the coat check when my friends and I were leaving.  We left around 12, because honestly the old school rap just isn't our thing.  She seemed ridiculously bothered initially that we wanted to leave so early. We had taken pictures on our phones of our tickets in case we were to lose them on the dance floor.  Of course this happened to my one friend.  Apparently the picture wasn't good enough for her,  and she told us to wait until everyone was let in.  We waited for almost a half hour,  with her repeatedly telling us that we had a problem waiting.  It ended up that one of the doormen noticed and came to help my friend get her jacket.  Thankfully he did because I'm pretty sure the woman would have made us wait until the end of the night,  when she would conveniently have a minute.  I'm not normally one to write reviews,  but  I have never been treated so poorly or with so much disrespect.  I sent the club an email voicing my displeasure and received an email back from the same girl,  with the same excuse.  We have a problem waiting and don't understand their protocol. No apology or explanation. Considering I have worked with the public myself for 10 years,  I am at a loss for words.  I feel bad for the 3 people who's coat check tags I saw on the ground while looking for my friend's,  I doubt they ever got their jackets back.",2014-11-17T23:39:14Z,97
175,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"The treatment I got in this place is the worst I've had in my 7 years living in Canada. I am never coming back and I don't understand how they run their business treating people like that! The staff was so rude!!! My two friends and I were eating downstairs and the waiter told us we could go directly to the club, so we did but we weren't expecting to stay long so we didn't check in our bags and jackets. Then the security guy came and told us super rudely that we needed to check them in, and when I tried to explain to him that we were just waiting to one of my friends that had gone to the washroom to decide if we would stay or leave, and that we would check them in the coat check if we decided to stay, he started yelling at me without letting me speak. When I told him not to yell at me and tried to explain him again that we were just waiting to my friend to decide, he said ""do you even speak English!"" I've lived, worked and studied in Canada for 7 years so yes, I do speak English,  but I have an accent, so I found this question EXTREMELY offensive and inappropriate). With that I didn't want to continue speaking and my friend (who also has an accent) tried to tell him  that that was not right to say and that we were leaving as soon as my other friend came from the bathroom,  and he replied ""I don't care, just get the F*ck out."" I couldn't believe we were being treated like that, we will never come back to this horrible, horrible place!",2018-12-02T01:55:26Z,97
176,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"There only a few clubs that I am willing to go without a huge twist of the arm.  Fortune is a terrific place with a great vibe, it lacks that pretentious or fake feel, and it's a great venue to hear music or watch performances.  

I've gone to a couple of hip-hop performances and all have been great.  It's not the type of hip hop show that attract the douche gangster wanna-bees but true hip hop loving folks that are keen on some clever rhyming against some sick and smooth beats.

Friday nights are quite different from Saturday nites.  I've only been to the Saturday night once or twice and I found that it was a younger crowd but packed wall-to-wall.  I preferred the smaller room that night because the music was more my thing.  Fridays tend to play more house music, both current and old.  There's two bars, a smaller room, and a private room for events.  

People say that it's not in the greatest part of town but it's not like any other club in Vancouver is in a stellar and clean 'hood.",2012-05-11T06:01:48Z,97
177,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"Before I say anything, I have to say that the sound system is incredible.  It envelops you in an ocean of rhythm, harmony, and emotion..  It also doesn't leave your ears ringing.  However, asides from that, I was not as impressed with Fortune as many people.  I felt that it was overpriced, and that the music which was being played out of said amazing sound system wasn't that great.  Half the time, I felt like I was standing there going ""How do you dance to that????"".  And is it really worth $15????  I've paid $30 to go to one of the best clubs in Montreal (in one of the hottest location) to see Bob Sinclair.  Or, I've paid $15 to go clubbing on the top floor of the tallest building in the city.  I just wasn't exactly sure what I was paying $15 for. 

Also, is it standard that guest listing only gets you ahead of the line?  Every other time I've guest listed, it's been a no cover deal.   

I also found the location a little sketchy.  As a single woman going to a club and then heading home in a different direction from her friends, Chinatown does not feel like the safest place to be.  I usually walk everywhere, but I hailed a cab this time.   I think I prefer clubs in location with a little more hustle and bustle.  

Overall all though, I did have a great time because I was with some great people!  It's amazing how even when things don't live up to expectations, the friends who you go with can exceed them.",2010-07-10T04:07:17Z,97

182,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"Fortune sound club has been somewhere I have wanted to go for a few years and when a new musician I was interested in was going to be playing there my friend got us tickets and we had a plan. So we get to the club and my friend tries to pay the bouncer to get past the line and that didn't work so we go to the back of the line which seemed to file into the building within five minutes but if it hadn't it would not have mattered because they have outdoor heaters for winter lineups. So the fast lineup system was impressive and we were glad the bouncer refused the tip. That was when we realised the long lineup was for the actual entering the club and coat check but as if the gods were listening we hear a familiar voice greeting us and sure enough my friend knows a bouncer and we pass right on by the slow line and we find prime standing room and order drinks. The service was friendly and fast and the drinks were really good, not watered down like I expect in a downtown club. The washrooms were nice and clean and so was the entire place. When the musician came out the crowd sort of just circled around and the sound was amazing. It's set up perfect for sound and the performance was amazing. I liked everything about the club and would go back for any event. They really impressed me and i would give it a 9.",2018-03-09T01:07:02Z,97
183,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"My boyfriend and I looked around yelp to find a couple clubs to check out during out weekend getaway to Vancouver, since Fortune Sound got so many great ratings, we thought we'd give it a try.

Pros: Great sound, great decor, great staff.
Cons: Not central at all, expensive drinks, slightly limited bar selection (they didn't even have grenadine!), slow start (wasn't alive by 11:30 on a Friday), lacking a party feel, a lot of people standing around.
Cover was $15 on their ""Happy Ending Fridays"" (still not sure what that meant)Also their Long Island Ice Tea was $14! The bartender even told us that it was a rip off.

Along with the long walk at the beginning of the night and the $15 cover, this wasn't worth it at all, we were pretty disappointed about the entire experience, but I will give it 3 stars because the staff was really quite nice and helpful, and it really did have a great decor, and being a sound tech, I know that this place has great sound.",2010-06-30T05:12:30Z,97
184,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"If I was to design a perfect club, I don't think I can do better than Fortune (well, except in my fantasy club, drinks would be free for me and it would never close).

I know clubs are very subjective - as it all comes down to the crowd and music.  But I even hear praises from people that aren't into the same 'scene' as I am - at the risk of sounding vapid, it's probably 'hottest' club at moment.

Being in Chinatown (where Royal Unicorn and Ming's was), far away from other clubs, it would be easy to miss the modest sign and the tinted black exterior if it wasn't for the large crowd outside.  Scale the staircase past the Obey/Shepard Fairey wallpaper, and you will see a huge dance floor, a large bar, elevated DJ booth, and a small lounge area where the ladies like to rest their feet.  In the back of the club, there are some booth seats and a smaller bar and the 'Livestock Listening Room' (never been inside, but it's for private parties).  The influences from the owners and crew (Gman & Rizk, Livestock and Timebomb) are apparent.  So, you can floss that fly fitted and crispy kicks (if you don't fear they may be stepped on). The staff is friendly and the bouncers don't have roid rage attitude like most other places.

The main attraction is the $250,000 Funktion One sound system, hence For-Tune SOUND Club.  Amazing clarity coupled with bass that you feel, means a packed dancefloor.  On the nights I've been here, it's lively mix of old-school funk, soul, and hip-hop expertly mixed by the guest DJ.  However, be sure to check their tweets or blog (http://fortunesoundclub.blogspot.com/) for events and the DJs playing - as there are house and dancehall nights.  Not the place to hear Top 40, but an excellent place to meet that dreamgirl (or guy?) that loves Wu-Tang as much as you do.

Most importantly, the mixed crowd is stylish and fun and is here to party.  As Joseph B. mentioned, no douchebag uniforms (fake tattoo Hardy shirts or striped shirts with popped collars) here or stuck-up girls - plenty of that scene on Granville.

Given the popularity and how many things they do right, it gets extremely packed on the weekends (~$15 cover).  Show up early or be prepared to wait in line for long time while being pestered by the Chinatown vagrants.  The craziest night being after Jay-Z concert when Jigga himself dropped by the club (!) and I was on the wrong side of the rope :(

I love this club - I only hope that their success doesn't go to their head.  The few clubs that saves me money as I'm usually having too much fun dancing instead of spending time at the bar trying to supplement my own fun.",2009-11-28T23:00:29Z,97

the bartenders were all cool and seemed to be having fun.  i wish i knew who the dj's were because they destroyed the floor  for the few hours i was there, with the help of the function one sound system of course...yes indeed.

186,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"I will only consider the FSC as a show venue for this review.  I have never been here for a usual club night.
I saw the band Little Dragon last night, and found the venue fell short for my overall experience.  Over 450 tickets were sold for the show, and it seems like that was really too many.  Granted I am no amazon woman, but I couldn't see anything aside from the occasional scalp.  I tried up front where I was doing an unsolicited lambada with a few other fans and gave up before oxygen depletion kicked in.  Retreating to the back was a better bet, but still no real view.  The stage is far to low to give anyone a great vantage. My boots stuck to the floor, and on our way in the lines through various check-points seemed a little over the top.  I would say we waited about half an hour to get into the actual club, so we missed the opening band.
The lighting and sound seemed pretty decent, so at least I got a bit of a laser show to the sounds of the band....",2011-01-13T00:37:18Z,97

If you want to pop, lock, and drop it, get low, or just dance in tight revealing clothing, that's what many people at Fortune do. Girls are attractive.

Music is DJed US rap and hip hop. Good stereo. The DJ played the crowd well and there weren't any buzz kill songs. Multiple bars and a beer tub by coat check so getting a drink isn't a problem. Old busta, obscure bad boy, cash money, noreaga, no death row, nas, fabulous . . . A chubby girl might dance into you a lot and palm your ass multiple times. Lots of eye contact. First time I didn't feel guilty for making eye contact with girls in Vancouver.

188,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"My friends and I went to Fortune Sound Club this past Saturday night.  It was terrific! 

I had read in other people's reviews how friendly the staff were...it's totally true!  When we got there we were greeted by smiling staff :)  Also towards the end of the evening, I realized that I had lost my coat check ticket.  I went to the coat check girl and explained that I had lost my ticket but I did remember the coat check number.  She said it was no problem and I just described the 2 jackets and she found them and gave them to us.  Normally, at other clubs, you have to wait until the end of the night, until everyone else had picked up their jackets and then, maybe then, the coat check staff might give you your coats.  This wasn't the case at Fortune and we were really pleasantly surprised.  

The drinks were definitely reasonable ($6.75 for a single highball, $8.75 for a double).  Also, I liked that their ""bar vodka"" was Absolut (not some crappy stuff you've never hear of) and that they poured into shot glasses and quite often let it overflow over the sides of the shot glass a little bit.  They didn't do it for every drink, but it happened a few times and this made me feel like they weren't trying to be cheap!  Also, the bussers who were picking up empty glasses at the tables only came to pick up our empty glasses when they were actually empty!  At many other clubs like the Red Room and Celebrities I always feel like I have to hold onto my glass otherwise the bussers take them away even if they are still 3/4 full.  I don't know why clubs think that if they take your almost full glass away that you'll just buy more booze and forget that it happened.  This may be the case while you're at the club but you remember these types of things (ie: why I no longer go to the Red Room or Celebrities and why Fortune is now my new favorite spot).

It was $15 per person cover and it was worth every penny!  The music was sooooo good!  It was deep, soulful, tribal house music but totally dancable (sometimes deep house can be a little bit slow to dance to but not in this case).  The place was packed and everyone was dancing.  My friends and I are definitly going back soon!  I think this place is our new club to go to :)

PS:  I would recommend going early as the line-up starts around 11pm.  By 11:20 the club was packed.

The security (and staff generally) are friendly, the crowd is cool (never any attitude), and the music is always great, whether you're there to see a live show or you're in the mood for dancing.

Opener at 10, crappy DJ comes back at 10:25, and the headliner finally goes on at 11:06. I have no problem with bands starting late. That's the nature of the beast. But making everyone sit outside while people on the street pepper spray each other for more than an hour after the doors were supposed to open is just ridiculous; not to mention wasting time in between sets with the DJ who was clearly wasted and playing a pre-made mix no one was dancing to.

191,Fortune Sound Club,3.5,"I've been really looking forward to going to Fortune for some time as I've heard it is a great live venue and different from the rest. Unfortunately the host/hostess, whatever you want to call the greasy hipster taking names at the front, ruined the entire experience and my first impression of the club. I won't go on a personal vendetta against him, but to be frank, he was awful. I worked in the hospitality industry for over 5 years and as a doorman specifically for over a year. Never have I been more turned off from a club than from the experience I had with this cream puff. It's unfortunate that one person can sway my entire judgement of an establishment that I otherwise probably would have liked and had really hoped to... but sadly I was turned off before ever getting the chance. 

The amazing thing about the situation is that the doorman who was patrolling the sidewalk was extremely pleasant. Instead of the normal douche who yells at you to get off the road or to move from out front of the club's exit (and admitingly I was one of those dicks in the past), he was kind and simply requested that you move along.

Hopefully I will come to forgive and forget the greasy prick at the front who goes power hungry with a clipboard and return to experience the good things I have heard about this venue... but until then I am left with the sour taste of a rotten a$$h*le.",2011-06-11T08:35:47Z,97

Anyhow, came here randomly on a recent Saturday with the urge to dance. I could hear the amazing beats from the street and cover was steep at $25, but 100% worth the quality of jams. Major ABGT/Anjunabeats vibe that night. 

I have always followed Celebrities because they are the venue for Blueprint Events in Vancouver, so if you have a love for EDM this is where you will find headliners like Chris Lake (Feb 9th), Audien and Andrew Breyer. 

I must mention the epic sound system installed in Celebs because you will not be disappointed and of course....the super fun light show that never gets old. 

Drinks are strong, coat check is reasonable and I love the upstairs for a bird's eye view of all the party goers while you dance in a much less crowded area. Dancing is applicable anywhere really. See ya at Chris Lake, Fans!",2018-12-30T09:17:28Z,124
204,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"Scamming tips!! I ordered a drink from the bar last Saturday & the bartender told me it was $10.75. I paid using my debit card & when I went to tip I noticed that the amount she entered was for over $12. I asked her why the amount was now different & she said it was an automatic gratuity on all debit & credit card transactions. But she failed to tell me about it & I almost tipped twice! When I went back to tell all my friends, every single one of them had tipped on top of the tip they had already put on the machine without letting any of them know!! 
This is a disgusting scam & there should be a note put on to the debit terminals warning people.",2020-01-22T17:11:03Z,124
205,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"This review is for the Ghastly event on 06/09. 

My group and I are from the U.S. We wanted a table during our vacation, so we decided to book a table months ahead with their promoter, Cole. After a lot of back and forth texting with Cole, he confirmed pricing with us and everything. Cole sent us the bottle pricing. The strange thing is he never gave us a layout of the tables and asked us which table we wanted. I'm not sure if the table reservations run differently in Canada, but in America, it's different and more organized. 

The morning of the event, we texted Cole to verify that our reservation is still confirmed. Cole agreed. An hour or so before the event started, we get a text from Cole and he's changes the price on us. He also tried to come up with a lot of excuses saying that he put our name down for Fortune Nightclub. It was clear many times what night club we wanted to go to. He tried to make it right with us by letting us talk to the VIP manager, which didn't really solve our problem. The VIP manager just told us that we can get discounted VIP tickets at $30. By that time, we couldn't even buy cheaper tickets online cause they sold out. 

We decided to go through with the VIP tickets because we already planned to go. We went through the guest list at night with no wait. The only good thing about the VIP ticket is that we didn't have to wait at all. We basically walked in. When purchasing tickets, they will scan your driver license and take a picture of you.

For all the trouble we went through for this nightclub was so not worth it. The dance floor is too crowded and packed. My group preferred the upstairs, since it wasn't pack. This night club is so unprofessional. They do claim that they are a high end club. I disagree. I'm not sure if it is because we are Americans or something, but I felt mistreated. I don't think I will ever come back here. I would say avoid if you can.",2018-06-15T00:54:13Z,124
206,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,Was having a fun night until my friend was brutally roofied. My money is on the bartender. Same one that rolled his eyes at the other 1 star review. He rolled his eyes at me while asking for water as well. Then he got in an argument with my friend and 5 minutes later she was out like a light. Sus if you ask me,2022-07-26T02:50:44Z,124
207,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"Went there for the WESA Pageant so it wasn't a regular clubbing event at all. I also didn't order any drinks so I can't comment on the staff, even though other reviewers seem quite put off by them.

The renovation looks amazing. Probably one of the nicest clubs I've seen in awhile. I like the lights on the ceiling and the front end of the club. I also like that they kept the upstairs which is great for people watching and also watching the shows that happen there. 

Also really appreciate the all-gender washrooms. It meant no lines (YEH for women!!!) and not having to worry about being misidentified.

Two stars off for:

- washrooms. I know I just complimented them above but the star off is for how filthy they are. I guess it's a trade off for having all-gender bathrooms, but they were gross.

- the fact it's dubbed as a gay club but has a predominantly straight crowd. The WESA Pageant is an exception because it's in support of the lgbtqa+ softball league, so of course there would be lots of our community representing; most of the time it's a lot of straight people. 

RANT TIME: There are tons of heterosexual clubs on Granville Street. In fact it's so happening the police don't allow driving after a certain time because of all of the drunk people stumbling everywhere. So it seems like a lot of women who don't want to be groped or ogled or disrespected by the creepy men like to go to the shelter of the gay clubs. Unfortunately, that doesn't stop the same creeps from following them to those gay clubs! So what it ends up being is a scene of people, plus straight women and then throngs of men who are trying to pick up the women. I've actually heard a guy say, ""That guy was hitting on me! He thought I was gay!"" He was horrified. But let's think about it for a second...you come to a gay club to pick up straight women and then are disgusted when you're hit on by a gay man at a gay club. Just wow.",2018-06-11T18:35:45Z,124
208,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"Great music, lighting and sound. Overall a really good time, however, the crowd doesn't seem very approachable and friendly like at some other places.",2020-02-25T05:33:31Z,124
209,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"I've been going to Celebrities for 2 years now and it is always my to go place on a night out! The drinks are good and the bartenders are even better! I have seen the crowd become a little less friendly, and a little older over past 6 months but I can count on having decent music and great Drag events when I am in. 

I'm a big fan of the local queens and it's really quite a show when we get queens from off island in for the night! 

I recommend bringing all your friends, even the straight ones, as mine have never had a problem having a good time here!",2019-12-30T22:37:46Z,124
210,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"This has been the only official bad night I've had downtown and once my friend got roofied so I spent a night in the ER. The music was honestly horrific, I spent 2 hours there and went through 2 DJs and they played 2 different beats. The first DJ played a song that the crowd knew for 15 seconds and only because people kept asking him too. If multiple people tell you to change the music then you should take the hint. They will post hype videos of people dancing but it will only be the first 3-4 rows of people who are inebriated enough to dance to anything. My friend and I wasted 2 hours and decided we would rather brave the 20 minute walk in the rain to Levels. The Uber back to the car played better music and we were only in it for 8 minutes.",2022-02-27T09:09:36Z,124

212,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"Make no mistake-this place is basically a straight club every night of the week except for Thursdays and Saturdays. The Vancouver gay scene is pretty male from what I've seen but this place is just super straight. I was visiting the area with friends and decided to hit it up, and if it weren't for being there with my friends would've seriously regretted it.There were some seriously sleazy guys who hit on certain girls in our group and the music wasn't even that great till later in the night. I would not return.",2013-04-01T00:22:21Z,124

I met some great people and had a blast!",2015-03-24T03:01:58Z,124
214,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,We were forced to wait outside in line for over a half hour despite having already purchased our tickets in advance. Staff was rude. They were offering to let people cut the line for $16. Sounds system really isn't even that great. Avoid this club. There are so many better places to go in Vancouver.,2017-01-15T21:26:57Z,124
215,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"Bought our 50$ tickets online and lined up to get our stamp and head out for some food and drinks. While waiting for other friends to get their stamp we held their mcdonald cups (yes there was secret substance inside) for maybe 3 seconds before the main bouncer came to us, created a scene saying we were drinking out of it, and threw the cups on the roadside (that's 150 dollars he poured on the street btw). He later crossed out our stamps and went inside. We accepted that part bitterly...fair enough we didn't want to argue, we didn't talk back and we just left. We got 50 dollars each from the bank to go back to the lineup. The bouncer saw us again and kicked us out of the line. Said we had to pay him each $40 to get in again. I told him, we had already paid for ""what we did"" with the $50 tickets we just lost. He said that wasn't his problem and accused me of drinking out of the cup. I didn't drink before that, so I told him to test me because he was wrongly accusing us. We really wanted to see Yellowclaw that night. It was a thursday night and nothing else was open. Lucky bastard earned himself $120. After he got his money he is all gucci and pretending to take care of us by saying to be careful next time. If he hadn't asked to be bribed, I would still be ok with it, but the fact he took advantage of us was disrespectful and inappropriate for how much respect we had already given him. He abused his power and because of him I rate this place 1/5 for the bad service I received. Maybe if we weren't holding the drinks we would have been a lot better, but from the way I see it, things could have worked out much better than they did. I am very disappointed with this place.",2016-04-11T07:16:49Z,124

Oh yeah, I think it's free a lot of the times for guys, and $5 for girls... but the bouncers are usually quite nice about giving you tickets for free cover when you strike up a friendly conversation with them.",2011-10-01T02:20:52Z,124
217,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"I used to love Celebrities ...when I was 19!  I think it used to be disco Tuesdays or something that we'd always get into somehow.  Now, the once ultra-gay bar is more straight than ever and it feels like unless you're on something other than booze, it's just another bar.  And if I want that there are many other locations I will go to. It's a bit too much at times, and I guess it's personal preference, but if you're looking for an exclusive experience this is not it.  It's a giant space, great for Euro DJ dance music and hanging with a lot of gay and straight people who need a place to come down from a high. No fancy decor, no fancy service and not a big deal.  You will see drag queens, there is a smoking-room in the back, two-levels and a lot of space to dance.  Maybe I'm just getting too old, but it's one of the last places I would go in town for a good night out.",2008-11-25T21:20:53Z,124

This used to be on the top of my list; music was bumping, crowds were good, bartenders moved the line quickly.

220,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"I can't even begin to say how disappointed I am in the absolute lack of service we received last night. We first arrived at around 9:41 for the guest list line up only to be turned away by the bouncers, telling us that since we were 1 minute late (we had to transit all the way from Richmond for fucks sake) and we had to wait at the back of the regular line up. They told me they would only let me and 4 of my friends in right away which I refused to, we opted to wait in line instead since it was me and my friends birthday and we didn't want to separate our group (plus we were late so I understood that there were regulations and happily obliged to wait in line). Little did we know we would be stuck in line for a GODDAMN 3 HOURS in the rain, having the bouncers pace back and forth up the line with their beady little eyes and greedily (AND RUDELY) telling us to just pay them $20 to grease the line to skip to the front AND pay additionally for the cover. Honestly, the worst part wasn't even waiting in line, it was the fucking bouncers!!! We would ask them how much longer it would be, and they would cockily shrug and reply, then ask us why we wouldn't just pay them money to skip the line. They kept upping the price to grease the line as well, it went from $20 to $60 by the time we left. The last straw was when one of my friends stepped outside the barricade (not even an inch away from it) for some fresh air since we were all cramped in this little space like a pig sty for almost 3 hrs already, and politely asked the bouncer how much longer would it be. The bouncer rudely ignored her question and started mocking her (saying stuff like ""why are you even bothering to ask me, do you think it's okay to make your own line?), accusing her of trying to cut in line with us and accusing all of us for covering for her when we tried tell him that we were in line for the past 3 hours. He even said ""if I asked the people behind you, I bet they would disagree"" to which everyone behind us (strangers) told him off telling him that he was wrong. Either he's a complete fucking idiot for not recognizing the same people standing in line for 3 hours or he's just an paranoid asshole (or both!) He made a complete scene, and ass out of himself, and called my friend out in front of everyone, almost making her cry. I was completely appalled and at that moment I just walked out of the line, and all 13 of us left. I don't understand why celebrities has such awful customer service, it has completely ruined my first clubbing experience, I am so angry and honestly I wish that I could give this shithole 0/5 stars.

They have the some of the best, if not best EDM music in town!  I guess the only complaint I have is that it's literally too loud some nights to actually have a conversation with anyone here and your ears will leave ringing at the end of the night sometimes.  

But oh the memories, so many here.  I remember the old days when DJ Betty Ford was spinning and that was awesome.  The new renovations make this club look more upscale. 

Make sure you call in for glist as it can get packed and you'll be thankful you're in the VIP line and not in the regular line.",2014-12-06T23:25:35Z,124

We bought tickets ahead of time for a decent price so we didn't have to wait. Being from sunny LA, we were totally new to the idea of a coat check which was $4 CAD but they also take $4 USD. They're getting the better end of the deal when you pay using USD but we didn't have any local currency so it was convenient. The bar also takes USD. This club is full of guys! Probably a 4:1 ratio? I agree with the other reviews- this is not a gay club. The club is pretty spacious and the drinks are cheaper here than in LA so that was nice. They played dub step the entire night we went.",2018-02-03T21:06:57Z,124
224,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"I'm not going to lie, I used to spend a lot of my time on weekends here (and the occasional Wednesday and Thursday). I'm not sure what about it I loved, but 20 year old Issabelle used to be obsessed with coming here. 

1) If you're a fan of electronic dance music, this is one of the best spots to get your groove on. The shows here are some of the best because of how close the stage is to the floor, so you feel like you're up close and personal with the artist. 

2) Drink prices are cheap. I mean, I usually only stick to tequila and vodka-sodas, and I'm willing to pay $3 for a hi-ball and $4 for a tequila shot any day. 

3) It's very spacious. There's a lot of the room on the dance floor to dance and move around. There is an upper level that has plenty of tables and more room to dance that overlooks the stage. So if the sweaty dance floor isn't your thing, I'd recommend spending your time up here. 

4) The security guards are some of the nicest ones I've met. They handle the intoxicated club crowd with a smile on their face and I've never seen them rude or forceful. 

One con is the bathrooms. The ladies room doesn't have very many stalls and on a busy night the line to the bathrooms can be out the door. 

Other than that, Celebrities, you'll always have my 20-year-old heart.",2017-06-08T03:26:15Z,124
225,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"If you're visiting Van-City and you're looking for a good party scene, then I would forget and avoid Celebrities! The cover charge can be very expensive on a weekend night, depending on what event is going on. I was visiting Vancouver for a couple days and I thought of checking out the party scene on a Friday night. I got to see Getter which was a pretty amazing experience. However, most people tend to stay at a club for at most two hours. For a club to have such an expensive cover, two hours is not worth it. I happened to stumble into a large group of young Americans, mostly college students, when entering the club. The males in our group were treated as second class citizens by the bouncers. That is true with most upscale nightclubs in large cities though. 

If you live in Vancouver or its vicinity, then Celebrities is an upbeat and intimate venue to check out! It definitely gets the most hype out of anywhere other night or dance club in Vancouver. The lighting and sound quality to this place is also amazing. Lots of friendly people here as well.

If the cover to this place was even half the price, I would give this 4 stars. 5 stars if I'm being nice. However, Celebrities gets only three considering the expensive cover charge. I ended up not getting any alcohol, just water, as drinks would also be expensive.",2018-10-19T02:40:56Z,124

I recommend coming here for concerts, I don't know how it is on a regular club night. Small club but plenty of room to walk around, there's an upstairs too but I couldn't really see anything.

- Coverage: depends on the night, I think? $50 when I last checked, which was hella high...
- Atmosphere: Pretty good. Music was bumpin', the vibe was live, and the club was surprisingly clean LOL
- Sound system: really good

The only draw back was the signs in the washroom LMAO I couldn't tell if the signs were saying that all washrooms were for both genders... Which I got hella confused and ended up in the girls washroom (sorry). The guy's washroom, which has a dark blue neon light, was just too dark so I couldn't tell, while the girl's were bright and pink.... Which I was also confused after reading the sign haha (sorry, ladies)... When you go, you'll know what I mean.

So I never write reviews and this is new for me. I love Robin Schult's music and think hes boss.

But no, 1am and 3 hours late robin schultz is still not here. Its not even like he had a good opening act but instead didnt give a shit about his fans and im not gonna wait until 3 am for him to play his dumb ass pirated music.

This place really has changed within the past 4 years I have been to this establishment. This place has really lost it's own touch of gays. Instead, the group of gays are getting younger and younger, and on top of that the service of the place has heavily dropped. The bartenders are amazingly nice and polite, it is the people who work at the door. They are the most meaniest and nastiest people I have ever met. I mean, yes, you work at a club, yes you want to party instead, but at least smile. I am not talking about the ushers and the body guards, I am talking about that lady who works at the entrance who takes cover etc. She just has this vibe on her that really hurts the club a lot, she also works for coat check and she is just a snappy little bitch (sorry for my language).

On top of that, why are there straight men in a gay club? This club has changed a lot in its attraction point. There are a lot of ""rowdy girls"" coming to the club instead of gays. It has lost their background of what a gay club should be.",2010-11-27T10:21:24Z,124
231,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"Went for the Porter Robinson and Madeon after party coming from the main show . It was -4 outside while we waited in line to get in for 45 minutes , while bouncers went back and fourth the line asking people for 20 dollars to bypass the line. On top of that their was an couple incidents with the homeless harassing/touching people, more less women in the line freaking them right out and security decided to turn their heads with the issue even with it being directly infront of them. Disgusting. 

Also they decided to kick four people to the back of the line , when they were 8 spots away from getting in, as they stopped in the near by donair store to use the washroom , maybe gather some warm as like I said the line was 45 minutes long and freezing.. 

I put my 2 cents in and asked the bouncers ""well what were they suppose to do ? Piss right here on the ground ?"" He replied with ""should have gone before they got in line , why are you trying to argue ? Do you wanna get kicked back too ?"" I proceeded to reply with ""nobody expected to be out here for an hour ""

He actually gave me a nudge and walked by . I won't ever be going back, and it's unfortunate because once inside, its a club with good sound system and good artists. But I won't stand in line as a paying ticket holding to go through that again . Did I mention that I missed half of Porter Robinson and Madeon's duel set on top of all that ?

Being a Motley Crue fan since they first came out and were mistaken for being girls hehe we
had to go check it out.

Short line up outside but the people who checked ID and tickets were very friendly. We had our tickets (a steal at only 22$) and were able to score the best seats right by the DJ booth.

Gogo dancers danced in front of us for most of the night and all i can say is that they really need to get a stylist! The cheap footwear really pissed me off- if i have to watch them all night at least get some hot looking footwear!

Drinks were moderately priced and the one time we ordered from the waitress wow was she fast!! 

Bathroom was not too bad on the cleanliness scale- but why only one ladies bathroom ? Had a girl from the Yukon ask where she could score some coke and me not having a clue, she continued on her quest .

Tommy Lee came on and sadly he wasnt as hot as i expected. His hair was cut way too short! Anyway  i am a metal chick and from what i heard it seemed to be the same variation of the same song over and over ......

Wish he would of mixed up a Crue song or even a Methods of Mayhem ...

Chad from Nickelback put in a cameo and as my gf said ""We got our celeb fix""

Overall a fun night out but i doubt i would come here unless there was an event.

234,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"I love this place.  It seems that more and more my reviews and trending towards venues that serve alcohol and play loud music - this doesn't bother me.

The staff here do their jobs well. The security outside has always managed the throngs of drunks without excessive force or rudeness.  We are kept informed about waiting times and cover prices and have yet to wait ""too"" long.  

The frisks in the door are just enough to weed out the weapons but not too invasive. I have never had issues with security here.  

I only come out for specific headliner shows so my reviews have all come from experiences on nights when the music is top-notch and everyone is in a great mood.  The service at the bar is quick and friendly although they do not run tabs - this would definitely be appreciated.  

The lights and sound systems are great,  definitely a favourite of mine for taking in electronic shows.  You will see a lot of younger guys wearing rave gears on these nights but it certainly beats the guys that go topless to the club... I mean seriously, how is that ever allowed anywhere?

238,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"Worst clubbing experience ever.  My friends and I didn't even get a chance to go in.

Celebrities on Tuesday is extremely busy with hundreds of young and basic kids in college trying to make it into the club.  If you think you will never get in, YOU ARE RIGHT. 

Three ways to get into the club:
First, you have the guest list/VIP line, which has to be done days before the night to ensure your group can get into the stinking place.  Second, the regular line, A.K.A. you need a miracle if you're standing and waiting in the line on a Tuesday night because the line will NOT move.  And lastly, the greasing line which involves giving $20+ to the bouncers so they let you in faster.

I have been to other clubs around the area (i.e. Fortune sound club, 560, Library Square, Lamplighter) and have had an amazing time in all of them without a problem. 

I was excited to have a fun night out with my friend who was celebrating his birthday and many others, but we all wasted two hours waiting for nothing instead.  Bouncers were rude and the atmosphere was unorganized.  

If you're thinking of going to Celebrities on a Tuesday, go elsewhere!  Better yet, rent a hotel room with your friends, pick up drinks at the liquor store, and have a good time together INSTEAD of blowing off money for a cheap, unmemorable, and ugly night at Celebs.",2015-12-23T09:56:11Z,124
239,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"You need to put yourself on the guest list!!! It's so easy and the line is so long otherwise.  I emailed my request on Sunday for Tuesday and they confirmed it on Monday.  

I can't believe how crowded it was for a Tuesday!  The email said we had to get there before 10:30 or they won't honor the request so we got there a little after 10:00. The regular line was so long but there was no one in the VIP line for the guest list!  It's so cool to be able to just walk right past the line : )  You still have to pay the $10 cover though. 

Inside the club, it has a large dance floor, cool, and loud! I loved the music though. The DJ didn't talk at all, just played good beats. Just the way I like it! I don't know anyone could stay still in there. And actually no one was. 

The bartender we latched on to was super sweet and made good strong drinks! I always try to stay with the same bartender and tip well.  

I had so much fun!",2014-05-07T20:31:50Z,124
240,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"There needs to be a balance between letting people in to the club without wait because they were on guest list and those people that waited in line for long time. That said, it is completely unethical to ask straight cash bribe to be let into the club outside of the cover charge. (obviously expecting nightclub bouncers to have ethical knowledge in the first place was wrong).

Cash in hand for the bouncers at the door so that one can get into the door to pay whatever the formal cover is absolutely ridiculous!

246,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"Went there with a gay friend who came out of town to experience the ""gay"" night life vancouver has to offer. It was fairly disappointing as most of ppl there are actually  straight. We got there at 10pm on a Saturday night and followed the ppl outside for a line-up. Soon after, we were told by the security that the line was for the ppl with ticket n we had an option of paying extra $20 per person on top of the $45 cover if we want to skip the line or to line up on the other side and get to go in after the ticket line. We were not that desperate so we decided to wait. We got in after waiting for almost an hour, which is not too bad for a saturday night I guess. 
This place plays electronic music only, not my cup of tea unfortunately. The crowd is made up of mostly young ppl in their early 20s and some dressed up super casual. They ""jumped"" to the music instead of dancing..kinda awkward IMO. Other than that, the place itself is quite cool especially the light effects n all that. Drinks are cheap/standard as well. Overall, this is not the kind if clubbing I normally go for, so probably won't be back again.",2017-12-10T23:50:33Z,124
247,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"Celebrities on (Straight) Tuesday I would have to say it's a love/hate experience hence why the 3 stars. 

Good: It's by far one of the hardest hitting venues in Vancouver. Last Night show was epic!
However...

BAD: Being unable to get into this place is the biggest drawback. Cover is 15 bucks which isn't bad at all however to get to that point, you're most likely going to have to pay 20-35 dollars per person.... YES PER PERSON to ""buy/grease"" your way into the club. I've been to clubs around Vegas, Oklahoma City (ha yes Oklahoma), Miami, Chicago the works and ""buying/greasing"" your way is quite normal when lines out the door. However, still having to pay a cover afterwards is what makes no sense!  Hell, Club Drais in Vegas (the hottest club on the strip) you can get entry n cover taking care of for 10 people deep. It just shows that this establishment needs to address entry issues.

Now you've finally paid your way into the club or waited 1-3 hours outside to wait into another line to do a coat check service like WHAT THE FUCK! It was soo bad that I just decided to hold onto my jacket rather than waiting another hour to drop it off. 

So finally you would think you get to enjoy your show.... However this place is so packed that it makes you think if they are way over capacity. Either way, you are packed in their so tight. That A) you can't dance B) you can't get a drink in a decent time and C) you're getting bumped into soo many times that it kills the show. Plus feeling like a sardine in a can isn't the ideal experience! Most importantly,  I would be concerned that Celebrity is near or at capacity so if a fire/hazard did happen, I would feel like it would be a huge clusterfuck. Please be weary of that!  

Overall, this establishment cares more about taking your money but not fulfilling their duties their after. Service here is literally non existent.  Hell you already paid upfront- they can care less about you going forward in your experience... As much as I loved the music, I wouldn't come back even if they paid for my cover which also aided in bypassing the line.",2015-12-24T00:41:11Z,124

That being said, the team of bouncers on the outside of the club are on course to ruining everything else that this place has going for it. They are very rude and think that their power entitles them to act this way. You are the first face of a hospitality establishment that looks to provide people with a fun experience.

He repeatedly told me to 'calm down' when we were trying to explain how the girls didn't have a contact number BECAUSE THEIR CELLPHONES WERE JUST STOLEN.

252,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"So here's the deal on Celebs... A couple of the reviews here *might* be from actual gay patrons... but most are very obviously *not*. Here's the viewpoint of someone who IS... 

Celebs means well... they really do. The staff is amazing and the management tries to make it gay-friendly. Unfortunately due to recent crowd shifts, the only thing gay about this venue are the rainbow flags hanging outside. 

I have no problem with gay venues appealing to mixed crowds... the problem here is that being openly gay at Celebrities can actually be *dangerous*. Tuesdays are essentially a free-for-all with Vancouver's finest gang members. The police Gang squad literally starts their night here. Fridays are produced by an external company that brings in big-name DJs which again, appeal to and attract a VERY straight crowd which is often less than gay-friendly. Saturdays attempt to be gay, but after a full week of straight crowds, most Vancouver gays don't take the chance that their night will suck and just go elsewhere. 

It's unfortunate since this is a huge space that legitimately tried to be gay at its relaunch, and again, the staff is great! Unfortunately, outside of Pride week the crowd in this space is not incredibly welcoming of the demographic the club claims to serve. Again, this isn't a review based only on the presence of a mixed crowd... that can be super fun! But the crowd here is not one that boys want to be making out in front of.

254,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"I started going to Celebrities on regular basis since 2007.  Except the Fridays' EDM/techno/house night, it's a straightforward gay club, and I always recommend out-of-town friends that this is the flagship venue of Vancouver's gay nightlife.

By 2014 this club is basically a straight club that caters to gay crowd: Wednesday Bingo and Thursday Liberace, plus annual gay pride event. Promoters will try to convince you that Celebrities is still a gay club, for the sake of its location (the heart of gay village). 

Times do change and there will always be a shift in the demographics, but it's just sad to see the transition in the last 3-4 years, abandoning what it was known for at least in 2000s. (Since I lack knowledge of this venue's history, I'm just assuming it could be a straight club in 90s and decided to go gay and went to the peak in 2000s.) The only thing that hasn't change is the friendly staff.",2014-02-09T22:51:57Z,124
255,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"Review #5 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012

I've been here a handful of times and I've always had a great time. This is one of the most well known gay clubs in the city and I can see why: the crowd is young and hip and the music is amaze. Yup, it's amaze.

Tuesdays are straight night, so if you feel like going to a gay club without the fear of getting hit on the by same gender, go on Tuesdays. But I can't guarantee that :) As with any club, get there as early as you can to avoid line ups. Sometimes, even if you're on the guest list you'll have to wait, because there's 200 other people on the list. What I usually do is come early, get my stamp, and drink somewhere else (if I hadn't pre-gamed) because the drinks here are expensive. Plus, no one's really dancing at 10:30pm just yet. I suggest Two Parrots down on Granville. It's only a few blocks away; the walk back will give you a few minutes to settle down before going back in (hopefully, or they won't let you in).

It's a huge space but wear something light, something that breathes because it gets super crowded in there. The last thing you want is to be the hot mess dancing to Katy Perry or J.Lo (yes they play Top 40). No bueno. 

Not sure how much cover really is because the very first time I was there, it was $20. But the last two times I was there, it was only $10. They also have themed nights often. 2 Saturdays ago it was Britney vs Christina night - scantily clad dancers bootypoppin' to Slave For You, Dirrty, and a bunch of other remixed hits. Fun. Drag nights are good times too.

Love this place. 3.5 stars out of 5, but I'll bump it up to 4 outta 5. Would I come back? Just waiting for one of my friends to invite me to party. Down to go any time.",2012-10-06T03:58:01Z,124
256,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"You know how F* Me I'm Famous Guetta is like the hot House DJ hugely popular with mainstream crowds? Well, Celebs is like Vancouver's hottest gay club made highly popular with the mainstream (straight) crowds. It's not a bad thing, it just the makings of a wild and outrageous party! 

Playing some house and top 40 remixes, the resident DJs play music with a good beat and work alongside professional dancers that get the place pumpin' and crowd, energized. People come here to dance their little hearts out and put ""fire in their new shoes"" ;)

INFO:
- Drinks: ~$5.50 / Water: $4 / Coat check: $3
- Tuesdays are $4 double nights (Be there by 10pm in the summer). Saturdays are ridiculously busy (Be there by 11pm). Buy tickets for headliner DJs; they always sell out. 
- Go for an event or a highly promoted night
- TIP: Wear light, breathable and comfortable clothes. The dance floor is ALWAYS packed with sweaty bodies and there are no fans. *Trust me on this one - you can thank me later!
---
I've been there 15+ times and I only come for special DJ events (lots of the headliner DJs come here) and straight nights (Tuesdays and Saturdays), so I'm only speaking for those type of nights. I saw Morgan Page / Wolfgang Gartner's performance on Friday and that was hot. 

For a gay ol' time with friends spent breakin' it out on a dance floor, I'd choose Celebs any day.


PS. Money reviews for Celebs on here! Reviews from Yelpers Cameron M, Sheila W, Emily C, and the rest are all pretty much painting a good picture, so make sure you read their comments too. I'm just supplementing theirs ;)",2010-09-20T01:45:02Z,124
257,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"So I ended my night at Celebrities-my first ever Canadia nightclub experience sitting on the side of the freezing curb of Davies St. Fortunately my friends rescued me, we had poutine, and ended up throwing an epic after party. Things were not as bad as they sound, on a typical night where I rage out of my mind, lose my digital camera and get the boot by the bouncers usually will not end this well in the states. Where else would the bouncer say, ""If you threw up 5 inches to the left, I would've totally let you stay. But you missed the bowl, so I have to escort you out.""  He was even nice enough to pull my white furry hoodie jacket from the coat check for me after I got banished. 

Before I got the boot I did manage to get a good solid 4 hours in at this venue. It was my first club and first time in Canadia for a long time, so there was tremendous excitement.  And of course I pre-gamed extremely hard, more then I can ever handle. It also didn't help that my friend Pat had to get revenge for a party in the states where I destroyed him with my bar drinks.  So we came in with tickets, and negotiated our way to the VIP area behind the stage.  Celebs is setup like your typical club with bars on two sides, dance floor in the middle and your huge VIP area with seating behind the DJ. 

First this first, this was probably one of the better venues I have heard EDM from in comparison to a small to mid sized club in California. The music was banging, and as soon as we got our thumb print/ picture taken at the front door ( yes this is standard security procedure here!), Mike B was shuffling up a storm into the venue. Playing tech-house to warm you up to the main act is brilliant! In the states they drop this shit at 6am-10am to keep all the crackheads going. I like the way Canadia works. 

The VIP area is definitely not anything remotely close to the spots we have been accustomed to in Vegas. First of all you do not get your own space. Its a couch with a bunch of shared tables. Basically you get access to a ""VIP"" area. You can start a tab with the bartender and bottles (which are poured into shot glasses) are brought to you.  For those coming from the states, you can never have a bottle at a table if you get bottle service. Weird, but i guess its for our safety. As long as we got hammered we could careless. 

By the time Michael Woods came on, all of our Canadia friends were here at this epic reunion of ages. We had some difficulties getting them up to the VIP since security was strict. We even attempted to bribe one of the bouncers with a $50 (US dollars!) and he didn't take it. I guess the exchange rate wasn't in our favor that day. Either ways we had a better time roaming around the bar/dance floor area with the rest of the crowd. I had a ton of fun listening to some epic EDM delivered through some solid sound systems and I couldn't have drawn up my first club experience in Canadia better. 

PS. We are all straight, and we had a great time at Celebs. Of course we have great friends, and we just love the music :-) Its a gay club, but they do have straight nights. Be open minded and have a good time! Heck go shirtless rock some kandi and get some free drinks from guys!",2011-12-22T00:09:22Z,124
258,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"Depending on what night you show up at Celebs, you'll find a very different crowd. It's a huge dance venue, so it's great for people who like some space to shake their thang. You'll likely wait in line, but at least there are drag queens prancing around to entertain you while you wait.

Although known as a gay club (I've been there many a weekend night and there was a lot of man-on-man action, including an extraordinary number of topless dudes on the dance floor squealing when Madonna came on), I was there on a Tuesday night and it was pretty straight. There are also $3 highballs on special Tuesdays, which is a crazy hot deal for a club in Vancouver.

Wednesdays you might catch some strippers and dancing go-go boys are a regular occurrence. Girls can expect boys to jump the queue and pee in the ladies room. 

Plenty of women frequent Celebs. You can always pick out the straight guys because they're hanging off their girlfriends in some sad effort to show they're not into guys. A word of advice to those dudes: it's called gay-dar.  Gay dudes know a straight guy when they see one. Don't worry about it, and look around - most of the guys in here are probably more stylish, fitter and better looking than you!",2008-11-21T00:50:40Z,124

Love the location. I heart Davie! It was close to my former apartment. Tuesday night is straight night and drinks are only a couple dollars. You really can't beat that in Vancouver.

Hate:
What. Is. Up. With. The. Line. Up?? ESPECIALLY on a Tuesday night?? I came here at like, 8:30pm during the summer and they seriously had people lining down the entire block. But you know what the stupid part was? The club was freaken empty inside. SO NOT COOL! I only know this because after lining up for a while, the dude I was with flashed his silly RCMP badge at the bouncer and got us in right away. I know. Such a douche-y move.

262,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"Let me start by saying that I don't club very often. But according to the friends I went with, Celebrities was a step up from many of the other night clubs around town. We got there around 9ish (it was SFU reading break so we wanted to beat the crowd) and surely there was already a crowd waiting to get in. 

The club had a pretty good vibe to it and atmosphere wise, it was great. My girlfriend and I danced the night away and had a fun time with our friends as well. 

A few negatives I found was that the washroom was pretty beaten up (not that I'm expecting 5 star hotel quality here), the drink my girlfriend got (Sex on the Beach) wasn't exactly made correctly, and the music was really loud compared to my other clubbing experiences (and the DJ wasn't very good IMO). 

If I could, I would rate the club 3.5 stars rather than 4, but considering I had a fun night out, I'll give them the extra half a star :)",2014-02-14T22:47:37Z,124
263,Celebrities Nightclub,2.8,"Went to Celebrities with a group of friends 2 weeks ago.  Was not impressed.  I've been before, many times, and this time the experience was totally lackluster.  In the past, my general experience there has been just ok, but it's close to home and sometimes they bring good dj's so I still go from time to time.  

I went to see ""treasure fingers"" a dj from the USA.  He wasn't very good.  My complaint is not with him as a club can't really control what a dj is playing on a particular night but more with the atmosphere of the club and staff.  

The floors were sticky, there were broken glasses strewn around the club with no staff doing anything about it and the drinks were expensive ($8.75 for singles). I'm not cheap and I actually don't mind paying extra for drinks if the place is nicely decorated and has a great atmosphere, but this isn't the case at Celebrities. The place was not very busy for a Saturday night and to be honest, the sound system sounded old and not very clear at all.  Also, the bathrooms are always messy there.  It's as if they never have any staff go in there throughout the night to tidy up.

In comparison, last weekend I went to Fortune Sound Club and WOW, what a difference and an amazing experience!  Looking back on both clubs, I'm pretty sure I won't be going to Celebrities again.  It costs the same to get into both clubs on a Saturday night ($15) and the drinks are more resonable at Fortune AND the place was packed full of people, the decor was great, and the bathrooms always kept clean.

The place was decently busy as the night progressed but the staff at the bar was really friendly and quick.  The dance floor was surrounded by ledges and  comfy bar stools.  Solid for some people watching...especially when you don't know how to dance to drum and bass music.

As the place started filling in it slowly got really crowded. I knew the event was sold out so that was to be expected.  

I questioned if it was over crowded because it got to the point where if you were on the dance floor you were likely to take an elbow to the side of the head or something. Plus if you left to to the bar, good luck trying to get back to where you were. 

Bottled water costs $4 not sure about prices of alcohol since I didn't drink that night (was driving home)   

Staff members were awesome. at the end of the set, few of us fans stood by the side of the stage area in hopes for photos and such.  The security let some people in and rejected others but he said I can get a photo because I was waiting patiently.  For me this was great because I ended up getting a pic with one of the founding members of the band. -- so thanks super awesome security guy!

This place was so fun! Waited in line for about 15 minutes. Coat check worked like a charm. The music was great and the club didn't have many creepers.

When I entered the establishment the place was packed and everyone looked like they were having a good time. The staff here are completely amazing from the bartenders to the coat check girls. The doorstaff are very helpful and communicative, I get the feeling that they all have been doing this for a very long time. Luckily for clubs on Granville street that Celebrities rarely plays TOP 40 music on Friday or Saturday otherwise the other big clubs in the city would be suffering.

Anyway, now I only ever go to nights there organised by Restricted Entertainment and this Sunday they put on a Halloween party there. I will say that the staff are always great there! Also bar pour drinks are $6.50 so not too bad. Shots are kind of pricey though.

The decorations the club put up were insanely good. Way to go!

When I first walked in you could really smell the washrooms - not good. But they were actually alright inside. Often they can get pretty bad by the end of the night but Sunday was fine.

I love the dance area here and have spent many a song dancing on the risers over the years. I will still keep going to Celebrities as long as people I know keep organising super fun times here!",2011-11-02T02:40:25Z,124

When in Vancouver, and can have a night of dancing and partying, this is the club I always vote for going to. Usually it's with some gay friends, but I've also gone just with the girls and, regardless, always have a BLAST!

Gay clubs are great because everyone is so friendly, the music is always sick (unless it's some lame Top 40 night- don't know if Celebrities has Top 40 nights), you never see any stupid macho BS fights, and girls can dance and not worry about fending off drunk and pushy guys. I have been hit on by girls here and I take it as absolute flattery! Celebs isn't exclusively gay, so there's also the chance of meeting the type of straight guy that I'm into- ones that have no problem/insecurities about gay people, and are more evolved.

The last time I was here, a few weeks ago, my friends and I danced for hours to the most kickin house and dubstep I could hope for.

To play, you need to buy a stack of bingo cards (by donation but suggested amount is $10) and they provide the dab-o-ink's (da-boinks if you read it like I do, aka the bingo ink blotters). The tables are set up on what is usually the dance floor, and they fill up fast so its a good idea to email james@celebritiesnightclub.com before 4pm on Wednesday to reserve a table, (this event is every Wednesday, so you get can your hump day on with some da-boink). All of the donations from the lotto cards go to Friends for Life which is a non-profit organization that offers individual support and counselling, group and social support, body and energy therapies, nutrition programs and in-home support for individuals in the palliative stages of illness. 

Last night, they rasied $900! How cool is that?! You get to have fun with friends (and make new ones, as everyone there is super friendly, and people are more than willing to let you sit at their table if you ask) have a drink (or five, however I noticed its a lot harder to pay attention to Bingo and the numbers being called when you are blasted - not that I was, but there were a few false bingos shouted out cuz people were having a little too much fun) and donate money to a good cause (we're all gonna get old one day no matter how much plastic we get). So why haven't YOU gone to Bingo For Life yet? Still drinkin' that hate-r-raide?

Just kidding (except not really). Well, basically i don't even know why this is still on davie when it's pretty much become a straight factory. I admit I've had lots of fun here on pride nights and certain non-event Top 40 Saturday nights, but aside from that meh. Been to 2 hard candy thursdays, huge disappointment; on the second night the music was totally tragic and the go-go dancers were barely on stage. Never been to straight tuesdays and never intended to, but there's always this insanely long line up everytime i passed by. The drinks are also kinda pricey. It's under remodelling or something right now and i'm keeping my fingers crossed it'll go back to its root, but i honestly don't see that happening. We'll see.

Technically, Celebrities is a gay bar but you wouldn't know it unless you took a gander at some of the suggestive posters.  I could care less if the venue I'm going to is gay oriented or not, in fact, sometimes I prefer it because there are way less creepy jerks to harass you.  I am a woman after all and sometimes guys can get drunk and gross, y'know? I'm sure you do.  The venue is quite huge, my favourite spot being the upstairs hallway, just wide enough to dance in and still get some downtime from the madness below.  Drinks are pricey and they never have drink specials during DJ events but that is to be expected from large dance halls.  Expect to see major DJ's stroll through here on a regular basis, I went to see Richie Hawtin a few months ago and unfortunately, he had to cancel the show the day of.

307,Aura Nightclub,2.1,"First of all, this is an absolutely beautiful venue. From the cozy dim atmosphere to the pretty and colorful lights set up, this place definitely measures up to be a nice looking club. However, looks does not make up for other things like sucky music and such. 

Came here as the first stop of the night with my friends and we all got in for free. Make sure to sign up on the guestlist on the website (just to be safe) and come here before 11pm for free entry (guys are included!). For a Saturday night, this place seem a bit empty. Usually, empty = more dancing room but the music itself was horrible. There seems to be multiple people in the DJ booth and man...........music transitions were rough and song remixes were a bit whack. There was a mix of hip hop/EDM music but overall, it wasn't too fun to dance to since the moment you get into a song, it would abruptly change to another that had a completely different tempo that just throws you off your groove.

Another downside to this club was the drinks and music level. Ordered a cocktail drink that I ended up not drinking since it was far tooooooooo sweet. As for the music level, speakers are situated everywhere, and it was LOUD. My ears were still ringing after leaving the club, so I highly recommend bringing ear plugs if your hearing is sensitive or you want to preserve some of that hearing when you're old. Plus, the live drums didn't help too much either since I felt like I went deaf when standing close to the live drums + loud music. I will say, having a live drummer there was a nice unique twist and I would have enjoyed it more if the drums didn't overpower some of the good songs. 

In summary, this club was a mehhhh and leaving it early was a good choice. I definitely would swing back here and give it a second chance since I heard Fridays are pretty poppin' here.",2016-07-11T13:47:45Z,21

309,Aura Nightclub,2.1,"SECURITY EXISTS TO PROTECT THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF BAR PATRONS AND STAFF, AND TO NOT UNJUSTLY DETERMINE THE VALUE OF ONE LIFE OVER ANOTHER. AURA FAILS TO DO THIS. 

I got alcohol thrown in my face because the DJ's girlfriend thought I was smiling at the DJ when I was really dancing with my friends by the front of the stage. In a matter of seconds, she spilled a drink that was next to her from the elevated DJ booth down onto the stage, right at my face. My eyes stung and my face was burning. 
The bouncer swooped in and took me into the hallway and listened to my story. He said he believes every word but can't do anything because that's the DJ's girlfriend. He told me I needed to avoid the front of the stage. When I asked why he wouldn't do anything, he replied, ""some people have a higher standing in this world."" In other words, he basically said, you're nobody so you can't do shit. 

Three things wrong here:
1) he didn't immediately warn the DJ's girlfriend right after the incident to prevent future incidents. 
2) instead of protecting and making the patron feel safe in the establishment, he basically said if someone is bringing in money into this club, anything goes. Even if they cause harm to the customer. 
3) he restricted where I could or couldn't go in the establishment, which I paid my fair entrance for and even as the victim of an unprompted assault.

I said to him to at least accompany me onto the dance floor so she sees that her behavior isn't tolerated, or to at least give her a private warning. He said he couldn't and kept repeating ""that's the DJ's girlfriend"", ""I can't do anything because that's the DJ's girlfriend.""

To which I said, does fucking the DJ give everyone special privileges to treat other customers that way and make them feel unsafe?

He grabbed my arm and said ""well if you're going to be a bitch about it, you might as well just leave,"" and took me outside the club. 

To sum it up: I was the victim of an unsolicited attack by the DJ's insecure gf... and yet I'm told that I was being a bitch for calmly and rationally explaining that you can't tolerate a certain kind of behavior just because of spillover DJ privileges. 

Any adequate club owner and management staff know to prioritize customer safety for the long term success of the business (re: look what happened with Capris Nightclub just down the block). Here, the bouncer did not care, and this may be in fact due to lack of/inadequate upper management training. He decided to do something that was so offensive and unjust against the very people he was hired to protect. 

He had every opportunity to make it right. He could have made an effort to at least give off the perception that the patrons' safety was cared for by listening and suggesting alternative solutions. 

Of course, the only answer to escape any liability is to kick the questioning patron out. The bouncer knew that the establishment was at fault, so he reacted in the only way he knew how. By pinning the blame onto others and getting rid of them. 

- - -

I learned that at Aura nightclub, 

1) if you roll with the DJ, you get special above the law privileges. 
2) the establishment doesn't give a shit about whoever unless they're bringing money into the club. 
3) don't for a second think your safety is valued here. You're valued for what's in your wallet. 

Good luck at Aura.",2019-07-26T11:09:03Z,21

The bouncer then proceeded to grab $20 from him and say ""It's cover"". When he got to the window, he had to pay another $20 when they checked his ID. My boyfriend told the girl at the window that the bouncer already took $20 from him saying it's cover and she said whatever the bouncers take is completely different. (Keep in mind this is the same bouncer who stamps and gives you the final clearing before you go in).

Really confused, we went to meet up our other guy friend at coat check. He said he only paid $20 once. (Keep in mind this extra $20 wasn't to cut the line or anything. We were already inside and there was no one there) When we asked the girl at coat check how much cover is and explained what just happened, she was really sweet and tried to figure out why the bouncer took an extra $20 from my boyfriend. In the end she talked to the bouncer and the girl at the window but really couldn't do anything because it wasn't her department. We didn't want to confront the bouncer ourselves because 1) we didn't want to pick a fight 2)we just got in so why would we get ourselves kicked out?

Honestly, don't go here. It's a shitty club with shitty bouncers who think they're all that. I'm absolutely disgusted at that guy who thinks they can just trick people into paying extra. Do they not pay them enough as a bouncer that they need to take other people's cash thinking that's how they get in??

Worst management if they can't handle their staff at all from taking money from people.",2017-01-22T17:41:19Z,21

This is an Asian nightclub, but not in the good sense at least for non-FOBs. Haha  if you're not rockin a bowl cut, don't speak Korean or Mandarin, you might have a difficult time interacting with this crowd. 

Music was decent but the transitions were a little weak. Also the dance area is a bit small. Drinks were decent and bartenders were friendly. Great place to come for small bottle service parties of 12 or less with small coves and areas to accommodate.",2017-09-30T19:28:13Z,21

313,Aura Nightclub,2.1,"Been here a couple times, had fun dancing both times :) Legit hip hip and R&B music, and if you go early enough (around 10:30pm) you and your crew get free cover - including your guy friends.

Would give it 5 stars but one of the staff was really unprofessional when breaking up a potential fight. I get that drunk ppl are annoying/frustrating to deal with, and that it's important to be assertive and prevent the situation from escalating, but he bullied a customer just to appease his ego. I only saw this behaviour from a staff member once, so I'm not going to boycott them, was just disappointed to witness that.",2015-10-13T00:56:15Z,21
314,Aura Nightclub,2.1,"Where do I start.
There is 2 main bars (more in the back) that charges 2 different prices for the same drinks.
They upsell you to Belvedere Vodka without asking. They auto charge 20% tip without telling the costumer which by the way is illegal. The DJ feels the need to always remix the end of each song and it's frustrating.

Now the lighting is actually pretty neat and they always have hot dancers, but this price and tip thing pisses me off so much I can only leave a 1 star review.",2016-12-04T21:51:59Z,21

316,Aura Nightclub,2.1,"Went for a friend's birthday and reserved bottle service. When we arrived we got right in  and the inside is very nice! However once in our private table area our server came over and she was already wasted before even starting our bottle service. She continued to get more and more hammered as the night went on. Spilling our bottle (which wasn't cheap). By the end of the night we had gotten 2 bottles and had a lot of fun. But she was so un professional and did not deserve to be paid anything that night. She never even told us her name (she has short brown hair and skinny), but did manage to make out with one of the girls with us!  
Yes I would go back, but I don't think I'll ever spend the money and go for bottle service. Spending around 600 for 2 bottles you're obviously spending for the experience,  not the alcohol. Music was great, decor was great!",2016-01-30T03:49:55Z,21

Staffs are extremely unprofessional while one of them decided to pick a fight with my friend because the staff didn't like ""his attitude"". Basically, they are thugs who would intimidate to beat you up if they don't like your face. Music was bad -- occasionally they would play some good ones, but then it'll be changed to a completely different tune, making everyone lose their beat. This has to be the worse nightclub I have been to in Vancouver. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",2017-01-15T00:50:56Z,21

Apparently they had just opened though you would never know it from the terrible customer service.  When we arrived at the bar they had your usual dudes outside looking in bags, etc.  They looked in our bags and then told us we would need to check them.  So, we walk in, and up to the counter, and the coat check girl informs us it will be $4.00 to check our bags.  So I ask if I'm able to opt out, since I'd rather hold on to my bag anyway, and she informs me I'm not allowed.  I asked to speak with the manager, and long story short - the manager was RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE, and told me that perhaps I should ""Go back to New York"" if I didn't like how things were run here.  He was willing to make no concessions, even though it's a ridiculous policy to FORCE people to check their bags and then charge them $4.00 for it (to check a coat there is half this price!).  It's not like we were carrying luggage!  It was a backpack!  And a small one for the beach! Not much larger than a purse!  RIDICULOUS!!!  We were the only ones in there and it was MIDNIGHT on a FRIDAY!! Terrible service, terrible ambiance, over-staffed, and under patronized (for good reason it seems!)

We got there and someone had used up our names for the table. Once we paid cover on top of the money I'd already paid to get table service we went inside. I decided to open a tab so the server took my credit card. We weren't enjoying ourselves so we decided to leave, and because i couldn't find our server I went to the bar asking for my credit card back and to pay my tab. One of the bartenders told me I didn't have a tab with them, so i approached another bar tender asking the same question when I did so the first bartender went over and told him to ignore me. They said if I wanted my credit card back I needed to go to my table and wait for my server to come back. So I went back and sat down and waited for the server to come back. I ended up having to cab home by myself because I had to wait 15 or 20 mins to get my credit card back. Never going back to this place",2015-03-24T00:23:29Z,21

327,Gorg-O-Mish,3.8,"It's a warehouse rave meets mainstream nightclub, except no alcohol for sale because it's an after-hours venue (thanks, No Fun City). One of only two ""mainstream"" after-hour venues left in Vancouver (the other being 816 The Bassment). Atmosphere and lineup-wise, I definitely prefer Gorg over 816. Some call it sketchy, others call it part of the charm, but I call it a place to lose myself in the music and feel the bass rattle my bones thanks to the epic custom-built sound system. Apparently, there are even subs under the wooden benches at the front of the club. If you've never put your back against the honeycombs, you have to try it once.

To anyone talking about feeling unsafe, I personally never felt that way despite the fact that I usually go solo too. You just have to use your common sense, keep an eye on your drinks at all times, and let the staff know if someone is making you uncomfortable.

Cover charge is on the average side ($30 last I was there a couple months ago) for downtown nightclubs, but what isn't expensive these days thanks to the cost of inflation? Definitely not somewhere I'd go often unless I can get on the guest list (not to mention I'm getting old and can't do late nights like I used to haha. Not 19 anymore!)",2022-10-17T04:12:38Z,16

When the night was done, we go to get our coats and the girl makes up a story about how someone walked out with it. How do they do that without the ticket? If people wanted to lose their jackets they wouldn't coat check. Seriously guys you charge 30 at the door. Pay these girls a bit more so they can buy their own clothes.

Crowd can be hit or miss.  I've been here a handful of times and it's been a cool fun crowd one night and another time a guy almost got jumped by an angry boyfriend after he approached to say hi a girl dancing alone on the dance floor.
If you want some water, you're going to pay $5, because the bathroom taps usually only have hot water.  For some reason last time I went, the right tap had cold water.  Success, re-fill water bottle 
The note on pricing from Vimi's review is a little out of date.  Girls will pay, sometimes, and guys pricing can be from $10 to $40.  It's more if you want to skip line which there can be sometimes around peak time (when bars close).",2012-08-17T07:48:43Z,16

It is totally a sketchy-chic late night crowd. 

Gorg doesn't compare to Stereo in Montreal or German after hours; but Vancouver is a small house music scene.

Not going to lie, this still doesn't match what I've experienced in NYC or Europe, but it wasn't all bad. I'd even say it's the best clubbing experience I've ever had in Vancouver. Usually the one of Granville have terrible music that kills the mood and the crowd are creeps and perverts. The Red Room mostly has great music, drinks are not as watered down, and very friendly bartenders. Door staff and coat check staff are a bit and miss but aren't the worst either. The crowd is a 70/30. 70 good chill and fun people just having a great time. 30 are more weirdos or just people that stand in the way or middle of dance floor but don't dance or move. Haven't met a creep that tries to touch me or my friends though so feel safer. Price aren't the best but that's all of Vancouver for nightlife.

Drinks were standard price, not cheap but not expensive, and free water was available all night. It is a small venue and it took a while for people to come in but the attendees were very on-theme and everyone seemed like they wanted to be there.

I will say first that music inside is great; however, that's where the good ends. We had guest list (which you have to pay for in advance!) that said it was valid for cover discount until 11pm, showed up early and got in line around 10:20pm; they only had one big line up for everyone (guest L and non-guest L) and so we got to the front desk at 11:03pm. Front desk was fairly rude & they charged us full price without honouring guest list despite us getting there close to 45 minutes early. Drinks were expensive but not ridiculous. I've had way better experiences with Levels if you want a club vibe. Levels has a separate lineup for guest list, and if you show up before guest list ends and get in line you get a free cover ticket immediately, regardless of what time you actually get to the front desk. Way kinder and way more efficient. I suppose it depends if guest list matters to you & what type of music you like!  Hope this helps",2023-08-16T03:59:40Z,55

We randomly found this place on yelp and they were having a dubstep DJ perform.  2 friends walked over to see what admission prices were and what time the opened.  The bouncer told us to come at 10:30 and get discounted tickets.  We left our warm bar across the street, where we had a table to accommodate us all, at the time the bouncer told us, only to be told ""no, the other guy had it wrong and you can't come in until 11 when the promoter gets here.""  We went up the hill to a coffee shop to wait around until 11.  When it was 11:00 we were told again that we could not get in because the promotor wasn't there.  

Seriously?  There are 6 females waiting outside to get in and get drinks but you can't let us in because you're unsure of admission prices?  When I asked about admission and letting us in, the guy said, ""it doesn't work like that here.""  Well, apparently nothing works well.

Came for an event I wanted to see. Already slipped the bouncer $20 each for a bunch of us to skip the long line.  Came back outside to meet a friend in line and they wouldn't let me back in and made me go back in line. Saw some ppl smoking in the back. The bouncer at that door said he'll let ppl in cause they came through that door and admittedly said he likes messing with their guests. Argued with the bouncers in the front and that i already gave him $20 not too long ago, and he implied I needed to give him another $20 to get back in. I was pretty livid but then I started feel bad that these 40 year grown ass men are so desperate that they needed to bully their guests to make themselves feel important. Or they're just desperate for money. Or most likely both.

Wonderful music from a mix of local and internationally known artists. You'll see some of their performers on the stages of Shambhala and Electric Forest. My experience has always been wholesome, from the humorous doormen to the kind patrons. So many random acts of kindness. I've also made long lasting friendships here, which I can't say of other bars.

351,The Red Room,2.7,"Never come to this place. Especially if you are not a local.

The nightmare happened last week. My sister-in-law and friends went to the Latin night and checked their bags in with attendant. Although they were fairly mistreated by the staff, it was not a big of a deal. The real issue happened at the end of the evening when they tried to retrieve their bags.

The staff did not find my sister-in-law's backpack, which had her cell phone and other important documents inside. Instead of providing support and recognizing that they were wrong, they kept mistreating them and asking them to go home, even though she had no keys or money, and was feeling unsafe to do so. Even though they eventually called her a cab, they did not even offer to pay for it. Adriana, the person who was leading the situation was most responsible for the disgraceful treatment that they received. 

When she arrived at my home, she was crying and feeling terribly upset due to the way they treated her and the fact that she had lost documents and money. I was able to track her phone down and call the police, which resulted in the people who taken her backpack/belongings to turn the phone off her phone in the morning. 

Strangely enough, an hour later, both the staff of the bar and the people who ""mistakenly"" took the backpack wanted to meet up to return the belongings. They kept asking me, and other friends who became involved, if we were local, which suggested that they were actually afraid of dealing with Canadians/locals. Questions such as ""is the guy accompanying you Brazilian?"", ""is your brother-in-law Canadian"" were completely out of place in this situation.

When knowing that the police were involved, the person who took the backpack asked to change the meeting location three times in a period of ten minutes and when we finally met them, voilà: a member of the staff was there to ""ensure our safety"". Once we recovered the backpack, my sister-in-law quickly checked the items but was very weakened, so we decided to go home.  She then realized that there were $35 dollars missing plus some minor items such as a lipstick. It was all quite clear that the entire backpack had been rifled through, as items were moved around and placed in different compartments than they were originally held.

We then decided to contact the manager of the night, Gerardo Avila, in order to get reimbursement for the money and all the extra cost that we had incurred due to night's misfortune (cab, phone bills, etc). To my surprise, he did not want to talk to me, which led her to talk to him a few days later. He did not only refuse to pay her for the reimbursement, but also offended and insulted her, asking her to shut up and ""do whatever she wanted to do"". 

So, one more time. DO NOT come to this bar. If you do, DO NOT check your bags in and pay extra attention to your surrounds. These people do not care about you and will not do anything to help you out if you need them.",2019-10-14T08:11:48Z,55

They're probably decent at booking talent most of the time so try on a regular night, don't go for a hyped event or you'll spend 3 hours and $20 anyway.

I went once for the 22nd Annual Shambhala Music Festival After Party. The talent they brought in was pretty good- we got in in time for Pigeon Hole. But the red room is shit about having consistent policies for all staff when it comes to managing expectations for cover price to people in the queue for entry. 

The event tickets clearly stated free entry before 11 PM so our group of 4 knew that meant we had to be inside the club by 11 and it didn't count if we were in the lineup. That's fair. 

We arrived at 10 PM in the queue. By 10:45 we had to make a decision about whether to continue waiting in line and risk getting in after 11 and having to pay the $20 cover charge, or to leave the line to spend our time elsewhere. One of the staff, a guy going up and down the lineup, scanned our preregistration barcodes and gave us a physical ticket stub. He assured that it granted us free entry so we decided to stay when we really should have left then. I thought Great, I guess 11PM from what it said on the online ticket isn't a hard deadline. We continue to wait in line until the club reached capacity and moving forward incrementally as ppl left the venue. At around 1 AM, after 3 hours in line, we got in and gave the paper ticket stubs to the girl giving stamps. But she disregarded what her fellow staff member had promised to us and made us pay $20 each for cover.

We tried to explain that the staff guy had scanned our free preregistration online tickets and given us paper ticket stubs and that he explicitly told us that the paper stubs meant we wouldn't have to pay cover, otherwise why would this staff member do his rounds down the lineup if everyone with ticket stubs was just going to pay anyway? She pointed out like we were stupid that the pre-registration to get in clearly stated free entry before 10 PM. 

Honestly it felt like the red room made the lineup wait outside just to hype up the club to more passersby. We didn't move much throughout the 3 hours and I got the feeling that the ""no cover before 11 PM"" and their staff who gave our paper ticket stubs was a trick to give false hope that you'd be able to get in without cover. They weren't planning to let in enough people to fill capacity before 11 PM in order to ensure that everyone would have to pay cover. Red room is a scam, it's not worth your 3 hours and your money.",2019-08-18T20:21:04Z,55

359,The Red Room,2.7,"I'm a HUGE fan of Drum and Bass. I just moved here from New York last month. When I saw Marcus Visionary was coming, I knew I had to be there and I've heard a lot of good things about the sound at this venue. 

I absolutely love the feel of place. It reminds me of an underground club in New York. The sound is absolutely incredible. I was surprised that the drinks weren't as expensive as I thought they'd be. The people were nice, the bartenders were great. The vibe was amazing! Even the security was super nice! I'm not sure if it was just the promotion company or if you're able to do it all the time but I was able to buy my tickets online in advance which was awesome. There was no waiting in a long line, hoping you'd get in and it wouldn't be at capacity by the time you got to the front of the line!

I was a little thrown off that you can't open tabs there and they don't take cards unless its over $20. So make sure you bring cash! I had to go to their ATM. Good news is the fee is only $2 or $2.50. Everywhere else I've been its $3 or up. I understand that tabs can be a pain in the ass (I've been a bartender for 3 years) but it's so much more convenient for the customers! Who carries cash around anymore?

I've been told that this the place to go for drum and bass and Saturday nights are usually the nights you'll find that there. You can believe I'll be back!",2016-04-11T19:01:24Z,55

Great sets and their stereo/speaker system is awesome. Big venue, nice people and the bathroom lines were almost non existent (compared to California) 5/5 stars",2018-03-28T05:08:54Z,55

I was grabbed by the nape and arms what resulted in a large bruise in one of them. I posted on facebook and they replied my post accusing me to have created a scene. After no more arguments from their side they deleted all the comments and blocked us from facebook to don't allow us to tag or give them a review on their page. 
The link of my post detailing what happened is the one below. 
They have a huge historic about rude treatment verbal and physical by the staff and security guards whom failed and refused to provide a proof when requested, that they are licensed as per the BC law obligates to be to exercise the function. They have absolutely no respect for the customers. I definitely would never recommend this place in my life.

362,The Red Room,2.7,"I have mixed feelings on the Red Room. It's one of Vancouver's staples for alternative events, and one of the few pretty decent venues that seems to be willing to house not-so-maintstream bands and club nights. Without the Red Room, who knows where some of my favourite shows ever would have ended up. Not just one-off bands and DJ's, but also regular alternative club nights. Kudos to you, Red Room!

That being said, there are some major issues that I have:

1. After the aforementioned alternative shows, they'll basically just say ""okay, you're done!"" at like midnight and all of the sudden it's all Top 40 and bronados. . . not that there's anything wrong with that, but if we've paid to see a show we should have the use of the room.

2. They won't give you water unless you want to buy a bottle. They just won't. I'd say maybe three times in the 30+ I've been there I've been able to get a glass of water without having to buy a drink to go along with it. It's absurd, and I'm not even sure it's legal. If you're reading this Red Room, please be more lax with giving people water. It doesn't cost you any money, and people literally need it to live.",2014-11-26T08:52:10Z,55

364,The Red Room,2.7,"It was great waiting in line for 25 minutes just to walk into an empty club first off, bad impression. The only thing that saves this place is the latin music they played for the Friday night. The service at this place seriously needs to be overhauled, they do not seem to like where they work, what they do.... or their lives for that matter. The cover was pathetically expensive for what you get: mediocre decor and expensive drinks from a surly bartender. The coat-check is incredibly poorly ran (I figured 3 bucks would get premium services considering most places are 1 or 2...), so don't expect to get out quickly when the poorly trained, overweight bouncers start snapping their fingers at 02h00.  Also, I watched the staff taunt a guy outside they apparently 'beat-up', don't know the whole story, but it was a ridiculous display from a place that should work on it's image. 

When you go out in the evenings you want to have fun, this place doesn't make it any easier than any other 'club'. Nothing special

Si je sors en boîte, je veux m'amuser: cette boîte ne fournit rien de supérieur qu'un trou de merde. Trop cher d'entrer, pour ce qu'on récevoit, boissons trop petites et le service est incroyablement malheureux ainsi que grossier. Il n'y a rien de remarquable ici sauf la musique latine qui est jouée les vendredis.

Cover wasn't unreasonable and I really liked the sunken dance floor and spacious stage. Three bars seems excessive for a space this size, but I'm no club expert. Also, drinks seemed a bit expensive, but maybe that's just my club inexperience showing again. It seems like it could be a fun place if I was willing to run up a big tab.",2009-11-23T09:20:41Z,55

The space is great with ample lounging areas and bars surrounding the dancefloor.  The back room was small but hopping.  The air-con must have been working double time but was luckily assisted with some well-placed fans. 
I saw the Buzzcocks here years ago and it's a good spot for live music as you can get a good view of the stage from around the room.  The tall cans of Strongbow are $9 - don't know if that's pricey but they are pretty huge. 
The back alley serves as the smoking area and it almost had its own party vibe going on.  Kinda fun even if you're not a smoker but just want to cool down.

369,The Red Room,2.7,"I haven't been ""clubbing"" in years, however, what got me out of the house, for the first of many is that they were hosting Galaxion: ""We turn the club into a retro arcade dance party complete with vintage arcade machines and classic console gaming on all screens."" Of course I got my hair all done, spent time on make-up and got my pac-man dress on (yes you heard me right....I said pac-man dress). I forgot about the do's and don't's of the club scene and was quickly reminded why I was/am annoyed with the scene in general (reason why I took such a hiatus). I honestly don't drink, therefore, no money was made by me. I just went for the experience more or less. The club itself is clean, small and somewhat cool. I paid $8 cover to get in which was reasonable. 

I wasn't there to hook up, just dance and take it all in. Everyone that I did talk to were easy to get along with. Whomever says that the Vancouver bar scene is anti-social needs to get their heads out of their ass. Thanks to everyone whom indulged me by matching against me on bubble bobble. Year's of practice in my room and playing against my best friend Rob finally paid off. I was admired and complemented on my skills on both this and pac-man. There are a few people (you know who you are) that I need to re-match again with. 

Of course I was the genius whom decided to remove the hair off my upper lip with  hair removal cream 30 minutes prior to leaving the house. I reacted badly to the cream and in placement of the mustache I had a red rash above my lip that looked like a Kool-Aid stain. Thank god that the club was dark and the lighting was flattering otherwise I would've been embarrassed all night.

I go to a lot of clubs to see concerts and the bouncers 9 times out of 10 act like they have a stick up their ass. The staff at the Red Room were awesome and polite, especially the door man who was professional, chill and put a great customer service face forward representing the working peeps of the bar/club scene. 

The dance floor is small and gets crowded very fast, therefore, I'm glad that I got a head start on this sooner rather than later. There were a few songs that the DJ lost me on, however, for the most part, danced my pac-man off.",2012-10-07T20:59:14Z,55

This place is great for live shows because there is some seating in booths at the back but also a big dance floor, its kind of like a mini-commodore ballroom. Much like the commodore, you would want this place to be pretty full to have a good time, because the dancefloor is pretty big and if its not full, it can also look pretty empty. Good thing Saturday night was sold out!

The drinks were a little pricey, I got a rum and diet and a gin and tonic for a friend and it was about $12, and they were both singles. Usually I am allergic to singles and only drink doubles, but I am on a summer spending budget.

People: 
The people at the dance floor are smelly and sweaty, so it stinks. The people themselves were nice, no complaints there, other than their smell.

Installations: 
Washrooms stink and apparently peeing on the floor is acceptable and normal for them. Other than that, it's not a pretty place to look at, but it's ok. 

Music: The music was inconsistent and the DJ had the crowd consistently confused about what to dance. A wide variety can be nice to have, as long as the transitions make sense and keep the flow, which was not the case here. 

Verdict: An unpleasant experience awaits for those who expect a respectable experience. If you want to feel like you are on a third world country where they treat you with no respect and with poor principles, go for it, it has all the package.

The tightness of space lends the venue an intimate feel but makes for getting around extremely difficult - there aren't any passageways effectively cordoned by the security staff for guests to move about. The bar staff is courteous, though the entire set up wouldn't really be considered professional by big city standards.

391,The Red Room,2.7,"I went to the Red Room on Saturday 14th Jan to see the Stanton Warriors. My ticket said the show started at 9:30 so my friends and I got there around 9:50. When we arrived there was a long line-up which I assumed was for non-ticket holders. When I spoke to the bouncers he told me everyone in the line had tickets. When I asked him why the long line up he said there was a ""process"" everyone had to go through to be allowed in. Everyone had to be ID checked, patted down and ticket checked. Fair enough I thought. Two and quarter hours later we finally got to the front of the queue. When we did eventually under go ""the process"" it took about 30 seconds. In no way does this excuse the fact that we were made to wait in the snow outside all that time. I've been to plenty of clubs and concerts these last 20 years but never have I been made to wait outside for so long when I already had a ticket. I completely fail to understand why they did this. The bouncers seemed to be enjoying themselves with the line-up, something I'm sure they do on non-ticketed nights but on a concert night where everyone has pre-paid it makes no sense does it? Surely that's just 2 more hours less when we could have been spending money at the bar? At one point one of the bouncers did walk up and down the line asking anyone with pink tickets to come to the front of the line. We had pre-bought pink tickets instead of internet tickets so I went to the front only to be told by the ridiculous bouncer that he had now decided anyone with pink tickets and a vagina could come straight in so I was forced back in line. 

When we eventually got inside I liked the layout of the club. Drinks as always were expensive but hey, this is Vancouver, North America's most expensive town for drinks so I didn't really pay much attention to that. I did find the washrooms were as typically disgusting as any you find in a nightclub. There was a guy in the washrooms handing out hand towels, something I find you only get in classy hotels or nightclubs. The latter being a pathetically disguised way of watching for people doing drugs in the cubicles. That's as may be but I'd have rather he did something useful like occasionally cleaning the toilets. 

What else can I say? Yeah Stanton Warriors rocked and we had a great time. The sound system whilst very loud (ringing ears the next day) was pretty poor sound quality and was distinctly lacking in bass which is a shame because the Warriors do like to stretch the bass-bins. Finally the visuals that were projected both sides of the stage were incredibly lame and I've seen better from Window's Media Player. In fact one of them was just a powerpoint page advertising the night. 

Overall I'd rate this place zero stars. I will never, ever be going back there again, not even if there's a good gig there; I'll save my money. Finally I suggest you take a look at 4 of the filtered reviews, some of which echo my feedback especially the bit about the needless line-up.",2012-01-23T02:41:26Z,55
392,The Red Room,2.7,A friend and I came here on a weekend trip to Vancouver. We got there at about 10:45pm and there was a line down the block that was not moving. We eventually figured out that if you wanted to get in you had to slip the very rude bouncer $20 to let you skip the line and get in another one to pay the $15 cover. We really wanted to dance some Latin music so we went through the ordeal and did get some good music on their single dance floor but also some very overpriced drinks. According to some locals the lines were not typical but this was the best Latin club in Vancouver so they just put up with it.,2014-08-24T04:06:11Z,55
393,The Red Room,2.7,"Not a fan. Lots of creepers, too many spanish songs with just the odd top 40 song every 10 songs. Good space but not the best crowd, and friends of mine who love it there admit that too. Been once, never again.",2012-11-19T01:11:11Z,55
394,The Red Room,2.7,"Went to Red Room for the first time last Friday. The crowd and music were good however some feedback for management. First I found the ""mandatory"" coat check quite bizarre. What value does this positively bring to the user experience besides the owners fleecing the patrons for that extra $3? If you absolutely must have my $3, then charge me $15 entry fee (instead of $12) and let me keep my jacket if I want to. The other issue was the bar man on the left of the entrance. On entry into the club, I bought a drink from him with no issues. Later that night i walked back to him to get 2 glasses of water (one for me and one for a friend though I believe an ""explanation"" is not relevant) Anyway he refused to give me 2 glasses. He gave me one saying ""I'm only giving you this because you bought a drink from me earlier"" Please tell me this is not the norm and he deviated from his customer service training. We're talking about water! Water!! Must I drink alcohol all night just because I'm in your club? Or maybe customers are expected to drink from the water faucet in the toilet if they get thirsty. Red Room is a good club but its the little things that absolutely ruin the customer experience",2013-03-24T20:41:19Z,55
395,The Red Room,2.7,"it probably would be an okay place and get a better reveiw if the bar tender  there didn't demand to keep your 'ID with your credit card to open a  tab. idendtity theft anyone??

 the night we went the place was a ghost town and my  friend's credit card had a $210 charge  ( they charged $70  three times )for our 2 drinks each. There was no way it was a mix up there were maybe 15 othe people in the whole place...

with staff who steal I won't be going back",2011-06-07T15:41:44Z,55
396,Drai’s Vancouver,2.8,"So me and a friend went to Drai's two weeks ago and I can't say it was the great club scene you find in Vegas.

We went on a Friday night around 12 pm and there was no line up, which would explain why it wasn't very full when we got in.  Our cover was only $15 which isn't bad.

I can't say I was super impressed. The club is located on the 3rd floor of Trump tower and honestly the lounge downstairs seemed like a better place to hang out.  There is one large bar and a pretty small dance floor. There is of course lots of paid seating upstairs and downstairs.  When we went the upstairs was closed off. The club is nice looking of course, partly because it's new.

We ordered two G&Ts, singles, which came out to $35! Whoah...I'm not in NYC!! I will say,  they were pretty boozy so I guess I could handle the price.  

Is it worth going too? No, but curiosity gets a hold of the best of us. So go check it out.  I'm good and won't be going back anytime soon. I will be checking out that beautiful lounge/bar downstairs.",2017-04-07T02:21:19Z,10
397,Drai’s Vancouver,2.8,"Brought cover online so we paid in advance and still ended up waiting 2 hours in line only to be so pissed off we left. Apparently, they outsold their venue for the night and there were 3 events going on. The bouncers didn't have a clue what was going on. Honestly, everyone who went in in front of us left after 10mins inside so we asked the girls, who were in front of us and were leaving, how it was inside and they said it was just a bunch of 40 years olds getting drunk and groping young girls. So even though we were in the front of the line we just left cause it isn't worth it.",2018-08-28T03:24:24Z,10
398,Drai’s Vancouver,2.8,It's a very nicely done.   I appreciated that all drinks were tax and tip included.  Dave was a wonderful host and props to the bouncers whom made me and my friends feel welcome.    Especially Cam.  The music was OK and I enjoyed the light effects here.  I heard there was a pool under the dance floor and am curious if they actually will incorporate that into the club one day.   One thing I like is that you wait in line for the club inside the building instead of outside-which helps especially because it rains so much in Vancouver.,2017-04-07T04:41:04Z,10
399,Drai’s Vancouver,2.8,"It was my first time at Drais Vancouver, it was awesome. Nothing like the other clubs in the Vancouver! Beautiful layout and astonishing service from everyone that works there! It's not like your typical venue or caprice with your power tripping bouncers and obnoxious service from the bartenders. 

At drai's Vancouver you find guest experience at its finest. They're attitude matches there beautiful lay out. One of our bartenders made me an old fashioned and poured my girlfriend her wine. The total came to 30 dollars. Completely reasonable. Also the tips included! I checked out the table service menu and it's actually a lot better than most clubs in Vancouver, especially with there layout.

Whatever rumour you guys are hearing about this place, most likely isn't true. In any service industry your looking at the service. Our host who gave us a tour had all the experience for making our night a memorable one. A Big shout out to Selina Loum! Thank you for your hospitality and proving the anti-drais wrong.  

I'll defiantly be back!",2017-05-01T00:26:55Z,10
400,Drai’s Vancouver,2.8,I was visiting my friend who lives in the apartment side and she suggested that we go down to the pool to hang out. Thoroughly anticipating a large pool...surprise! It's inside A club??? It was very tiny...This was during the daytime so there was just a handful of visitors sitting sparingly around the area. We were getting hungry so we decide to order some food as there was food service. Basically it's typical bar food from a small limited menu. We had to repeatedly ask for napkins and cutlery . Interesting they only gave us cloth napkins.... the chicken pieces were pretty moist and tasty but the Caesar salad was very plain and was like the ones you make at home with store bought dressing... no Parmesan even...the shrimp appetizer was very well plated and pleasing to the eye.,2017-08-04T18:03:41Z,10
401,Drai’s Vancouver,2.8,"Disclaimer- I don't love the Vancouver nightclub scene but I am quite a big fun of rad venues and I'll hit up the pool parties in Vegas so I am not a complete granny. 


I arrived on a Sunday just for 1 cocktail as my friend is a resident at the Trump Tower ( don't hold it against him). This is supposed to be prime pool party time. 

The space is stunning! The screens look incredible. The pool is tiny for a hotel as large as this though. 

We walked in to see about 10 people sitting around VIP tables. I know that this place is hurting because of the Trump backlash. The place was very quiet. 

We walked up to the bar and waited 5 mins for the bartender to say hi.We were the ONLY people there. Asked for a menu and ordered a popsicle in champagne. The bartender looks confused and walks over to who I can assume is the bar manager. He comes up and says ""she is confused about what you ordered."" I point to the item on the menu and he says ""oh yeah we don't have that."" I casually say ""oh that sucks.""..his response was "" it is a popsicle, I think you'll live."" Cool thanks for being super condescending. I order a Moscow Mule instead. At this time the original bartender is crouching in the corner taking a shot ( maybe this is why she was confused about the order?)  We wait about 10 mins for the bartender to craft our cocktails and then he puts them in front of us and we wait another two mins for the bill. Our 1st mission is accomplished; we have acquired a cocktail. I take a sip. It is fine but not the best I've had mostly because I prefer them to be made with crushed iced but it's all good. This is a pool bar not a craft cocktail bar so I am satisfied.

We go and sit outside on the patio and watch the scene. 

2 promo models dancing by the DJ booth. Everyone else is sitting at the VIP tables looking bored and on their phones. 1 table orders a $250 750ml of Grey Goose and two beautiful bathing suit clad servers bring it out carrying a light up magic wand. They stand there and the funniest thing I have ever seen happened. She is holding the bottle up to show the empty bar that these guys bought a bottle and they start dancing but the expression on both of their faces was priceless. Eyes rolling and looking very embarrassed. 

I think this place has great potential but truthfully the service and vibe needs to be cleaned up.",2017-09-06T20:35:49Z,10
402,Drai’s Vancouver,2.8,"The music was excellent. The service was good. But the club smelled like throw up, even at the beginning of the night. (we were the first large group to arrive). The restrooms were also the dirtiest restrooms I've ever seen-again- it was early and only a few people at the club at this time so it seemed they didn't even clean up from the night before.",2017-08-08T07:39:05Z,10
403,Drai’s Vancouver,2.8,"TERRIBLE!!! Went there on a Thursday, it was a strange crowd..... Drinks were WAY over priced as in 60$ for 2 vodka sodas (seriously?). And overall not fun! Never going back.",2017-04-16T16:06:34Z,10
404,Drai’s Vancouver,2.8,"Reserved a table on a Saturday night to celebrate a birthday with a larger group. Initially walking in I was impressed with the Trump hotel and had high hopes for the club. The club layout and atmosphere has great potential but I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the club and odour that I assume was coming from the floor in our section. It could use a good cleaning or renovation. The girl assigned to our table and take care of us would disappear for 45 mins to an hour, which got to be very frustrating considering we had a larger group and ordered 6 or maybe 7 bottles over the course of the evening. Besides the slower service, the music was decent, even for a night that didn't have an artist performing. Bottle costs are slightly higher than other Vancouver clubs so expect to spend more.",2018-08-08T01:42:29Z,10

407,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"Love the venue and always have- this review is directed at a staff member, and by extension, the management.

A coupe of weeks ago, I went to see the JINJER show and sat at the upstairs bar for a few minutes between sets. While there, I was watching the bartenders work- I was a mixologist for over 20 years before becoming a General Manager in nightclubs, pubs, etc, so I know what I am speaking about. I'm sitting on the side of the bar, enjoying my beverage, when I see the female bartender pick up a rocks glass and DIG IT INTO THE ICE WELL to fill it with ice for a drink, instead of using the ice scoop, as is required by BC health code. Big deal, you might think. Actually, it is, and here's why.

Not using the scoop does several things, all of them bad. First, the bartender's hand will contact the ice; this is cross-contamination, as their hands will have touched everything behind the bar- the cash register, bottles, countertops, their clothing, their face, the cloth used to clean the bar top, dirty glasses, the credit card machine (that customers touch all night) etc etc. Second, the glass itself will have been in contact with other surfaces like the tray or counter it was on, other glasses it is stacked on (placed there with the bartender's hands) again resulting in cross-contamination. But the big issue is that the ice itself will start to collect tiny glass chips from the rim of glasses being used this way- at the end of the night, when you melt down the ice wells to clean them, you will see tiny GLASS SHARDS on the bottom of the well- these come from the lazy habit of digging the glass into the ice instead of using the scoop, the shards chip off the rims of the glasses. This means that you run a very high risk of getting tiny slivers of GLASS in your drink. Pretty sure nobody wants that. A good bartender will actually be FASTER using the scoop if they know whet they are doing (but of course it takes actually paying attention to what you are doing, and learning how to bartend properly), so the only excuse is poor training, supervision and laziness on the part of the management and bartenders. DO NOT order drinks with ice at this venue- stick to wine or beer. Get your shit together Commodore!!",2023-10-18T21:12:55Z,98
408,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"The iconic Commodore Ballroom is a classic Vancouver giant in the entertainment world. 

Many top artists like - U2, The Police, Tina Turner, Lady Gaga & so many others - have performed here. 

A few shows I've seen here - Sly & Robbie, the Cool Ruler Gregory Isaacs, and now tonight the London soultres Ella Mai! 

Since it was last renovated back in Prince's favourite year - 1999, the CB with capacity at just under 1000, is one of the prime intimate venues dare I say - in the world! 

Surprisingly there isn't a mega gigantic sign on the building highlighting its location on the Granville Mall unlike its sister venues, the Orpheum & Vogue theatres. 

The dance floor here is very spacious is quite an experience if you've ever been on it! When everyones jumping up & down on it - I swear you feel like it's moving & it probably is!!! 

Ella Mai was fresh off her Grammy win on Sunday - massive congrats to her!!! 

To be honest it's rare for me to fork out money to go & see an artist with just a debut album out, but something about her vocals & production has me thinking & feeling she's going to keep climbing high & be around for awhile! 

She could actually be todays new Sade!!! 

I mean why not - she's todays 'empress' & possibly the future of sultry Soul/RnB music. 

Lucky Daye & Kiana Lede were surprisingly very good - vocals & music caught my attention! 

Ella Mai performed songs from her debut album & the backup singers & band performed tightly! 

The sound coming out of the speakers was crisp, clear, heavy, loud & I wanted more!!! 

Very good sound system indeed!!! 

If you can ever attend a live show here at this magnificent venue, please do - you won't regret it!",2019-02-13T11:27:57Z,98

It's not the greatest looking venue, and the bar is old etc but they host some pretty good shows and events.

This particular event was super fun and really packed!

410,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"I've had some great times here and seen some great bands, but I won't be going back after their decision to go cashless. I like using cash on a night out because I can make a sane and sober decision before the event on how much I'm willing to spend, and how much I should drink, and when the cash is gone, that's my cue to stop drinking and stop spending. With a credit card with quite a high limit it means I could end up waking up with a crazy high bill, and a terrible hangover and possibly some drunken mistakes. Cash allows me a way of safely controlling my night out, both financially, emotionally, and healthily. Goodbye Commodore, it's been a blast and it's sad to see you go",2022-09-23T07:16:01Z,98
411,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"I recently won tickets to see a show here and this was my first time at the Commodore. And I have mixed feelings about it. (The show was great, btw! I'm not reviewing the artist here - just the venue).

If I were in my late teens or 20's, or perhaps even in my early 30's, I'd be giving this place a solid 4 stars - maybe even 4.5 (rounding up to 5). It has a large, central ballroom floor for dancing, seating areas on the perimeter of the room on a few levels, two bars on opposite sides of the room, and a balcony for extra seating. They serve drinks and I believe snack foods as well. (This venue only admits people 19+ years old due to their liquor license, FYI). The bathrooms, while dated, are clean. The stage lighting and acoustics are great, and overall, this is a fine, intimate venue to see some big-name musicians. 

So far, so good, right? Here's where my qualms arise: Unless you arrive when the doors open (usually 90 minutes before the opening act), you likely won't get a seat. Which means you'll be standing up for the duration of the show. Which is fine and dandy if you're 25 years old, but when you're in your late 50's, no bueno. (Note: I was with a friend in her 30's and she, too, was uncomfortable standing so long. So it's not just me!). To add insult to injury, the seated folks at the bar behind us, although nice, kept asking me to move aside so they could get a better view of the singer on stage. Argh. By the end of the evening, my back was killing me and I made an emergency chiropractic appointment for the following day. Also, despite having a balcony with ample extra seating, for the show we went to, it was roped off (why oh why? There were enough people in attendance to warrant the extra seating. The ballroom floor was totally packed with standing people). Plus, although we didn't order any drinks here, I've read plenty of reviews and heard enough stories of people being overcharged for their drinks to believe these stories true (check your receipts before leaving!). 

Also, be warned, if you have a water bottle with you (as m friend did), they will make you dump the contents before entering. (Perhaps people try to bring in alcoholic beverages in their water bottles? Not sure. My friend had water. The guys outside said she could fill it up inside but there was no water fountain inside and there was a crazy long line at the bar. So...there's that). Also, I was told to wear my little backpack purse as a purse, or I'd have to check it (which isn't free). Strange. But..ok.

I would definitely return here but I'd make sure to arrive when the doors opened in order to get a seat. But, like I said, if you're young, it'd be cool to stand right by the stage and see a favorite artist up close!",2019-07-13T19:26:35Z,98
412,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"I love the spaciousness of the place and how every staff member is helpful and cordial. From the people at the door to the servers and security staff inside. I appreciate the general chill vib too of the place and patrons. 
But the main reason why this is not getting a 5-star review is that the sound quality is not consistent. I've gone to several music shows there and sometimes the sounds is great and sometimes it's pretty mediocre, from speakers cracking because they are too loud, to feedback from the mics. I wish the sound would be top-notch every time.",2020-02-21T19:59:09Z,98
413,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"The Commodore has stolen my heart.  

Seeing the eminently entertaining ""Leon Bridges"" show made me realize I have yet to review this venue.

If you want to go early and stand you can belly up to the stage and use it as a coaster until the show begins.  Anywhere provides a good view (and excellent acoustics).  There is an upper level with tables and chairs and these can be found on the sides of the stage level as well.

Drinks are a bit pricey but are good.  Splurge for ""tall"", or choose from a variety of brews. 

I love the layout and it is one of my favorite places to see shows in Canada.  One of my friends saw Lady Gaga here.  The next time Gaga visited she played GM Place; so it is a great place to get up close and personal with acts that may move onto less intimate venues.

There multitudinous eating choices close-by.  I have yet to eat on-site.

Vancouver has fabulous music appreciation.  My heartstrings were strummed by everyone dancing their hearts out & playing nice this week.

I was dehydrated and moved to the outside towards the end of the show.  Someone fetched water for me and then I happily joined a dancing group of people I had never before met.

415,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"Great venue with plenty of space!

My friends and I went to Slow Jam Sunday last week and had an amazing time. We bought our tickets on Ticketmaster in advance, but stood in line for a short while to purchase one extra ticket at the door. 

The bouncers were nice, staff inside were friendly, and the music was on point. The venue itself is huge with a coat check and merchandise booth at the top of the stairs, multiple bars, and another floor overlooking the dance floor. There was a ton of space to dance, and best believe, for this event, we needed it. The acoustics were good, but a bit too loud (bring earplugs to save those little eardrums of yours). En Vogue performed that night and gave a killer performance, as expected. Drinks were a little less than $10 each. The shots were on the smaller side, but still a great deal. The ""washrooms"" were clean and had a ton of stalls, and there's an additional washroom upstairs too. We stayed out until about 3am and the music was still going.

If you're ever in town for Slow Jam Sunday at the Commodore, do yourself a favor and go! If you're a fan of throwback R&B or love to get down with some body rolls, this is your spot on a Sunday night. Overall, there was an awesome vibe and minimal creepers.",2016-02-14T22:37:08Z,98

417,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"Having seen a few shows at Commodore and catching the KiD CuDi show this weekend - here's my review:

The Commodore is probably the best (general admission) venue to catch a concert in Vancouver - with it's thumping sound system, massive dancefloor and highly visible stage layout.  Flanking the dancefloor are the leveled seating/table areas, so you can be in direct eyeline with the performer if you want to just chill at the sidelines (that is, if you can snag the seat/table quickly/early enough).   With 4 full-service bars, a balcony, high ceilings, light show setup and a stage where you can literally touch the performers - this is a real concert venue, not a janky club.

Here's some quick pros/cons:

+ lineups to get for shows are quick - you pretty much get in as soon as you show up (this may seem like a given, but having stood in line for nearly 4 hours in cold NYC weather for a Busta Rhymes show, this is something I appreciate)
+ coat-check is $3 and you can double up for free
+ the venue is well-ventilated and spacious, so even sold-out shows don't get uncomfortably hot and (outside of the stage area) you can move around with relative ease

- no in/out privileges - being a smoker, this sucks - but it's even worse for non-smokers since it just tempts people to smoke inside (not me) and security seems to ignore this
- drinks are weak and pricey (~$10 for Jagerbombs, ~$7 for single vodka highballs - and the bar vodka is on tap - could be short-poured or watered-down) - not ridiculous, but little pricier than other clubs - but I guess they are banking on the captive audience.  Definitely predrink before coming here.
- leaving the show takes a long time as the coat claim works slowly
- security does nothing to stop people filming the show - now, I take the occasional picture or two, but to the all the people in front of me filming the entire show on cell phones: seriously, do you thinking capturing your 'memories' in 240x180 resolution with monaural sound was more important than enjoying the show and not annoying everyone around you?

Complaints about annoying concertgoers that you see at every show aside, Commodore is probably the best concert venue in Vancouver.  If I could pick, ever act that rolls into town (that I want to see) would perform here. A few points off for minor annoyances (that could easily be rectified).",2009-12-13T10:35:29Z,98
418,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"I went to the Commodore Ballroom thinking it was a lot nicer than it actually is. I went there for the free k-os concert that was held there recently.

419,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"I love this place!!! I went here for the first time this weekend and was amazed at how beautiful this venue is once you get inside, and the acoustics are great! Definitely not what i expected from the looks of the outside. Coat check. yep! Heavy poured drinks. yep! somewhere to sit or stand with a clear view of the show. yep! I like general admission shows but this place had tables and chairs all along both sides of stage in case you didn't want to stand the whole time. You can also go upstairs to the balcony and watch from above if you'd like too. The bartender was a nice guy who was very generous, thanks for the hangover. And, i do have to say security was a plus too. We were standing in the second row and had some girls pushing to get to the front, literally pushing and yelling, being really rude. Security saw what they were doing and instantly pulled them out of the crowd. I already love Vancouver, this is another great reason to go back!",2011-05-16T07:10:13Z,98

Having said that, the sound isn't as good as it is at the Vogue a block down, and you seriously need to bring ear plugs. The numerous bars  mean easy access to drinks without leaving the show, which is good for drinking, bad for the drunken douche-bagery that can follow. Security does a pretty good job of trying to keep people in check. I don't know of any ticketed venues that serve alcohol that let people in and out, so to those of you complaining about it, it's pretty standard in the city.",2013-12-13T18:57:55Z,98

424,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"Fantastic venue. I always look forward to a show here. The sound and the setting make for a great spot. I also like the capacity of the venue, I can always find a good vantage point. 

Seating and balcony space is limited, so if you want that arrive early. I personally arrive close to set time, as I've found doors usually open around 8 and no one goes on until 9:30ish I like to check set times on Twitter or other social media, they do a good job of releasing all the pertinent information before hand.

My only spot for improvement would be with the drink selection. Could use some local options and a better wine selection.",2016-05-08T22:17:06Z,98
425,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"Came here for a Christmas party.

Even though the ballroom isn't as large or as grand as the new Convention centres in town, there is just something special about this place.  An older style of elegance.  Something in the air that just spells ""classy"".

There's no parking on Granville Mall on Friday and Saturday nights, so your best bet is Pacific Centre.

As I always go to the same Christmas party every year, I can't say what the food is like for other events.  What I CAN say though is that the sushi they have at this even never fails to impress.  Today they even had ahi tuna.  That stuff vapourized in seconds.

With a ballroom, it's all about the entertainment.  Today I had the honour of hearing THE Dal Richards and his band perform.  The sound was set up quite nicely.  It was a bit on the loud side, but at least it wasn't ear-splitting loud (which is my pet peeve with many nightclubs).  The sound travels quite well here, and isn't echoey either.

As for the bar, it was a bit disappointing in terms of selection.  What kind of bar doesn't have Malibu?  I decided to use my drink tickets on ""simpler"" drinks such as screwdrivers.  They don't flood the cup with ice, which was nice.

The washrooms smelled kinda gross, but guess there isn't too much you can do.

Overall, always a good time here.",2011-12-11T10:34:54Z,98
426,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"Always a good show here. I really like the venue for the space and sound. The place also hosts good choices for music shows. I've seen indie, alternative, folk and rock here.

427,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"They don't allow you to go outside after entering, and at some shows they close off the balcony. I tried sitting in the closed off area during a show, and refused to leave when asked, as when I paid for the ticket I thought the whole place would be open. The security took me out of there, and one of them twisted my arm, which hurt me. They restrained me by the stairs for a while too. Furthermore, the lines for drinks were long since they closed off all but 1 bar. I would never support such a place again.",2018-07-09T06:21:26Z,98
428,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"Came here on a Wednesday evening for the Tokyo Police concert. If you've never been, be sure to come early right when doors open in order to grab a table with a good view. The Commodore does serve food and beverages, but most concerts are late enough (doors opening at 8) to allow for people to grab dinner elsewhere. Glanced through the menu in advance and a lot of the food looked fairly overpriced, so my friends and I decided to grab pizza from the Pizza Garden. Brilliant idea, as there was no in and out privilege, so we would've ended up spending a ton of money otherwise. 

Drinks were good, and the logistical set up is pretty awesome. If you're out on the dance floor, be ready for drinks to possibly spill on you. Also, know that you will probably step on something while you're out there too. The sound system is pretty decent. My friends and I were pretty close up so I don't know how things sounded from afar. Washroom ran out of TP pretty quickly though, so heads up. Coat check line ups are usually long when exiting. I'd probably go back, but would definitely plan things differently.",2016-10-19T09:42:13Z,98
429,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"An iconic venue and well deserved at that. I saw Interpol on their El Pintor Fall Tour 2014 and it was unbelievable. The sound, the security and staff - even the crowd, ambiance and everything else was just spot on. Plenty of bars all over the place for a quick trip to grab another drink without missing a single note - my expectations were high but far exceeded. 

A damn fine place to see a band play live.",2014-09-18T01:42:27Z,98
430,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"Even though the dance floor is less bouncy since they removed the rubber padding from underneath, this is still one of the biggest concert venues in Vancouver without assigned seating. The huge hard wood floors leading up to the stage fill up with a messy thickness of sweaty men and women, hundreds of them swaying at the back but full-body dancing at the front. 

On either side of the dancing strip are leveled seats and tables, and they provide great views of the band if you can manage to find empty ones. There's also a balcony at the back above the long and busy bar, where you can sip your $6 beer and watch the changing faces of the vast crowd. 

This is an amazing concert venue, host to every band from The Reverend Horton Heat to Gwar. It's located above a bowling alley, which should give you a sense of the long dimensions of the room. The only real problem is that ever since the new smoking ordinances came into effect they no longer allow people outside to smoke, which truly only inconveniences the non-smokers who have to breath in the inevitable clouds of second-hand fumes.",2008-12-19T22:00:17Z,98

432,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"I've said it before and I'll say it again here: If the developers that wiped out the Ridge and the Waldorf even cast a casual glance at the Commodore, I'll go unibomber.

This place has been an active part of Vancouver's entertainment scene since WWII! Seriously! And has been home to the BEST shows Vancouver has to offer consistently since.  

I had the honour of playing here several times myself in the 90s but even that doesn't trump the positive experiences I've had here as a patron seeing almost every band that I've ever care for here (on their rise up or down).  The list is too massive or I'd include it.

Despite the management changes, the renos and upgrades have always been to re-beautify this amazing room (though I do miss the glowing bubbly posts circa 80s 90s).

Though the room is usually dimly lit when I'm there,  I am impressed with the interior decor and lofty ceilings,  the air quality is usually pretty good (not hot and stuffy like other places).

Lights, sound and service are all top notch,  you can choose to sit along the sides or get right up on the dance floor as you see fit.  The only point I have to take away is no smoking section.  Though I understand the need to keep from door flow one-directional at peak hours,  it would be nice if the smokers could get a little balcony or something of the sort to get their fix.",2016-02-22T22:56:58Z,98

437,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"Historic landmark venue in the heart of Vancouver.  I love the Commodore.  I remember listening to The Fox as a young teenager and remember wishing I could go see a show on the ""bouncy floor of the Commodore"".  Now that I am an adult, I have seen a lot of shows here.  And every time I fall in love again.  

The renos done a while back are spectacular.  It is a classy venue, with great sound, and packs a lot of people without feeling too crowded.  There's space to sit, if you prefer, or room in front of the stage where you can get so close the sweat from the band might fall on you.  

Despite being in Vancouver, on Granville, the prices inside are not as high as I expected.  Sure, I'm paying $6.75 for a highball, but where am I not paying that much?    Also, coat check for $3 may seem high, but the darlings behind the counter let my friend and I double up our coats instead of making us pay per item.  No one lets you do that any more.  Kudos for not being jerks.

It says a lot about the legacy of a venue when the performer gushes about how thrilled he is to be playing there, and talks about memories of attending shows years ago, and how special it was to go for the very first time.

Oh, and a note to spectators - please leave the playing of instruments to the band.  That's right, Mr. Harmonica, playing along (poorly) to the encore.  Shut it.",2013-01-29T20:26:11Z,98
438,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"Two things happened for me the last time I was here: 1.) I saw the best show I've ever been to in my life, and 2.) I discovered a venue that I will always have on my ""awesome place to see a show"" watch list.

Did I mention how much I love the Commodore Ballroom and its new but old-timey flair?

First of all, the one-two punch of Jamie Cullum and rockabilly front act Imelda May left me reeling from so much jaw-shattering awesomeness that it made my brain reevaluate all my other past show experiences as it lay bruised and beaten on the floor. (Achievement Unlocked: Overload Yelp review with cheesy boxing references.)

Second, the Commodore is a frickin' cool space. Tables all around with food and drink service, AND an open floor in the center that not only lets you watch your admired act up close and all personal-like but allows you to bust a move if said performer cajoles your junked trunk to drop it like it's hot.

439,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"This is an absolutely stunning room and stunning venue. I was here last night seeing a show and my husband bought 2 rounds of drinks (each from different bars in the room- they have 2 separate bars on each end of the room). He tipped 20% for the simple beers the bartenders poured us- not even a complicated drink. The next day he was looking at his credit card statement and it looks like the bartenders CHANGED THE TIP AMOUNT and decided to give themselves a bit extra. What the heck??!!!  Check your receipts and credit card statements, there are some pretty messed up people who work here. We are contacting the credit card company now. I can imagine that the bartenders here skim a few bucks here and there after each transaction they can to increase their earnings and hope nobody cares enough to double-check their credit card statements. My partner mentioned that he thought it was weird that he had to manually enter the tip amount- seemed unusual since most places will have gratuity added in the machine + PIN entered. Looks like they use that system to scam people.",2018-04-30T05:32:37Z,98
440,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"History Lesson Alert! (Or: How Old Is That Ramon Dude Anyway?)

It's hard to believe that this building was opened 60 years to the month before I first set foot in here. So much history was consumed by this dance floor that I couldn't even begin to imagine the wealth of talent that has come and gone over the course of its lifetime.
It's truly one of the great venues in this city. For me, the Commodore defined concert-going as soon as I made it a habit of going to shows. 

And did I ever. 

Starting with The The at the end of '89, my memory can only offer a brief list of all the shows I have attended. Nitzer Ebb, Pre-Nevermind Nirvana opening with the Doughboys for Screaming Trees, Inspiral Carpets, Blur, Skinny Puppy, Sugarcubes, Happy Mondays, Mudhoney, Catherine Wheel, House of Love, Primal Scream, Paul Weller, Consolidated and Meat Beat Manifesto (amazing), Jesus Jones, Ned's Atomic Dustbin, Nomeansno, Lush, Pop Will Eat Itself, Ministry, The Pixies (several times), 808 State with Meat Beat Manifesto (again, amazing), The Toast to Coast 1040 party, Stereolab, Mr Scruff, Peter Bjorn and John, Ladytron, Broken Bells, Cut Copy with the Presets, Jarvis Cocker, Deerhoof, Blonde Redhead, Destroyer, OMD, And DOZENS more. 
I am missing so many, and I would have a very difficult time trying to recall them all. And I'd do anything to re-live every single one of those shows. 

In the midst of all that, there came Disco Night. For $2 you could shake your groove thing all Tuesday night long. And if you dressed the part, it wouldn't cost you anything.

Appreciation for the Commodore became painfully evident when they closed in 1996, starting a few years of concert doldrums for me. But all was well again when they renovated and re-opened in 1999 and started picking up right where they left off.
I've given up more sweat, blood and bouncing energy here than a year's worth of 6-year-old's birthday parties at Crash Crawlies.
It's thanks to the Commodore that there is a concert venue for shows up to 1000 fans who want to get as close to a band as they'd like to brave. And what a venue it is, with its spring-loaded floor, large unobstructed viewing, classy art-deco interior, and incredible location. 
One wonders if all the ghosts that dwell between the cavernous walls are still enjoying it as much as we are.",2011-10-14T03:17:32Z,98
441,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"I used to think this was the best place to see big acts in Vancouver, but over the years I've grown to absolutely hate this place.
Here are my reasons:
-My friend works here and says they are cheap, untrusting of their OWN employees, and they've bulked up security to a ridiculous level.
-There are no in's and outs. I don't smoke but sometimes you want to go outside for some fresh air, ""too bad."" they say, ""once your out, your out."" Umm, why did I pay so much money to have you keep me couped up, it's my money I should be able to go out and in as I please.
-the drink prices are stupidly expensive and most of the bar tenders are unfriendly (except Scott Lyon).

I came here to see Canadian natives Tegan and Sara. What better place than their homeland, eh?

This place was well taken care of. The sound was excellent. The upstairs balcony was great. The lighting was awesome! All important things for a music venue to have. 

They also had seats off to the side where you had a great view of the stage and big screens for close ups of the show. But, even standing in the back of the room, you could still see the stage. It was up high enough, but not so high you had to hurt your neck. They also had a small catering table set up in the back where you could buy food in case you got hungry. 

It was definitely a great experience seeing a show here. Totally worth the 3 hour drive.",2008-08-06T21:03:12Z,98
443,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"If I lived in your fair city, I know the Commodore would be my nightly address.

::::::::::SHOWS::::::::::
While in town over the weekend, they had two shows which were totally corey-worthy (I caught the Corinne Bailey Rae show, but missed the Sia gig.  I also saw lots of other shows advertised that I would have totally been down for). 

::::::::::THE VENUE::::::::::
The space is inviting and well-catered to live shows.  The venue is open with a large dance floor and framed with tables on the sides and up in the balcony.  There are several of bars, so you don't have to wait long for a libation.  

The sound  was crisp and clear (now the bass was a bit much at the beginning of Corinne's show, but the loud screaming horde in the rear got the Sound Man's attention).  The lighting brought out Corinne's sexiness and angelic stage persona.  And finally, the climate was just right.  I've been to many hot hot shows, and everyone's a sweaty bloody mess by shows end.  For me, the temperature was just right---an important thing.

And the dance floor is hardwood--which I love.  So, if you're a spinner, your ankles will be happy. 

::::::::::NOTES::::::::::
o  The show I went to was advertised as $32, but I bought my ticket at the door and it was $42.
o  No in/out privileges
o  Coat check was $3

::::::::::AN APOLOGY::::::::::
I have to send  a pair of apologies to the two young ladies who happened to be standing next to me near the streetside windows of the Commodore just before Corinne's took the stage.

Yeah, it was seconds before Corinne's set started.  There I was facing the stage, bobbing my head to a groove, eyes closed, and with a pint in hand (feeling super-cool in my own mind).  I felt peace, maybe a little too much peace.  

Because with a flash, I felt something out of nowhere softly land on my head.  My reflex was to move my arm headward to swat away what ever was crawling on my head.  Before I knew it, I totally sprayed a pair of unsuspecting females with a cold lager.  

EMBARRASSING!!!!

I felt like such a heel!!  I profusely apologized, but yeah, there was nothing I could do.  So, I slowly slithered away into the shadows.  Such a big dummy, am I!!

I know it's not a new dry blouse, but hopefully this song from Corinne can help take away some sore feelings:

445,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"The ballroom it is! I imagine it in it's infancy during the 1930's and can't help but fantasize about what it looked like, who was there, and what was heard during those first years. Now, every time I go, I take my own trip down memory lane on the decade I've spent on that sprung dance floor.

Just a few silly highlights of years gone by:
+Why oh why do I remember the Swollen Members concert? 
+An ABBA followed by the U2 tribute bands, huh?
+Legendary Disco Nights... I long for these again!
+NYE '02, or was it '03...either way, whoever slipped a bunch of us girls at the bar ruffies is still on my hit list!

Back then (drugs aside), I would have given the Commodore 5 solid stars. But now, with Live Nations mega fees, no in and outs, ridiculous priced drinks, and absolute crap selection of beer, I gotta dock 'em a star. It's still my favourite place to catch a show, but when you have to heavily pre-drink just to avoid drinking watered down or mainstream crap beer, it can really kill a fun buzz. But it still rocks when the Budos Band or The Heavy take to the stage during the Jazz Fest!",2010-06-30T17:02:33Z,98
446,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"Sorry to go against the grain here with a lot of people, but the sound quality is not great. I've seen 3 concerts here in the past year, and my overall impression is that ""loudness"" is being mistaken for ""quality"". 

Either the mixes of all three bands I saw were off, or the Commodore sound system has issues with feedback and distortion that wash out the quality of the treble. At the risk of sounding like an old man, it might be worth turning the volume down 20% to see if it makes a difference.
 
Please fix it. There aren't many smaller venues in this town.",2012-09-15T07:52:03Z,98
447,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"Holy fuck, this venue is beautiful and has an amazing sound system. When you walk in, you can totally tell why it is so highly regarded among venues of it's size. I like the option of being able to run to the front or chill at a table, and the easily accessible second balcony is great if you're short like meeee!

The drink prices are okay i guess. Dive bar it ain't, but it sure as isn't an  upscale joint either. Their bartenders pour well and make some spot on drinks, so no complaints. Personally, i like that you have the selection you would seeing a band at a dive bar, even if it is at a higher cost. Better than the prices and selection at GM Place, that's for sure!

The staff are pretty cool and seem tolerant of bullshit. A friend of mine and me got invited backstage after She Wants Revenge. We look trashy, but if they were hoping we'd put out they were sorely disappointed since we just saw it as an opportunity to (what else?) drink more. We were terrors and basically tripped and slurred until someone would give us more booze to make us sit still and shut up. In retrospect, we probably should have been kicked out on our wasted asses. (On a related note: Singer from She Wants Revenge, YOU'RE CREEPY.)

As much as i appreciate the sound system and history of the place, i just can't quite give it a 5 since it almost seems too big for a hobo like me who is used to seeing shows in little venues! Plus it's so nice that perhaps i just feel a bit out of place without being able to look on the wall of the bathroom wall to find out who to call for a good time. That's just me though, so if you have any dignity and don't get blackout drunk, this entire paragraph is irrelevant.",2011-01-19T04:41:31Z,98
448,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"The Commodore is a good medium sized venue, and one of the very few clubs with a 990 person capacity. A lot of the bands or shows I want to check out are usually booked here, but since this is the only venue of this capacity in Vancouver, a lot of the good shows sell out super fast, or don't get booked at all cuz someone else might be booked here already. It sucks because this venue offers you your only chance to see a band where you can weasel your way up to the front row for less than $30. Otherwise you would be stuck at GM Place or BC Place in a crowd of thousands of people. The only other venue we had that was comparable was Richards on Richards, but they are gone now.

You can get service at the one of the bars pretty quick, but the prices are pretty high, so drink before you go! If you get there early enough (which I never do) you can actually get a table and they serve food, so you could just skip dinner at home and go right to the venue. There are no in and out privileges, so the smokers are usually in a rush to get out after the show, if they actually didn't smoke during the show. I like the Commodore for nothing other than the fact that I can get in the crowd and dance in the middle of people really givin'er.",2010-01-28T04:44:19Z,98
449,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"The Commodore is no joke, hands down, the best venue for live music in Vancouver. My friends and I have a running joke that we will go see any band that plays at the Commodore no matter how disinterested we were in the first place. The atmosphere has proved time and again to works its magic on bands you weren't so sure of in the first place and amped up ones you were already stoked about. 

Probably the best thing about the Commodore is how easy it makes it for concert goers. Some people may line up at 5pm for the 8pm door but I think most of us know better. Any weekend headliner at the Commodore isn't going on till around midnight and weekdays usually sit around the 11pm mark. So even if your doors are at 8 you have lots of time to round up your friends or have a bite to eat before you head in. If you have the forethought remember to get cash before you go in! They recently added a second ATM but those lines can get super long nonetheless and there are no in and outs. 

If you do get there right on time you can probably snag some of the very limited seating and try some of the food. Their food is pretty good but nothing to write home about. Otherwise you'll be plenty early enough showing up at 9.

The venue itself has 4 full bars plus 1 beer stand which makes it easy to get drinks without the lines. The prices are pretty standard for Vancouver so bring cash if you plan on drinking. 

Like I was saying before though, this concert is perfect for concert goers. The crowds here, no matter the genre of music, are usually courteous and fun. If you're willing to withstand the pressure of a few hundred people behind you, you can get to the front very easily for your favourite bands. At the front or not, the acoustics are great everywhere in this venue because it is so small. Also, once the concert starts it's pretty easy to snag yourself a seat if you're on the last day of a three day bender or if you've been in the most pit long enough to loose all feeling and decide to take 'er easy. 

The security staff is always aware and do a great job of keeping everything under control.  

Other than that all I can say is that I have seen the best concerts of my life at the Commodore and I am currently holding tickets for two more upcoming shows there. It is my happy place.",2009-03-03T00:11:38Z,98

452,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"Live music lovers need to get to know this venue. It's such a fun place to catch a live show because it's a fairly small venue with a huge dance floor in front of the stage. I saw The Roots here and the guitarist even came off stage and walked through the crowd while playing his guitar over his head. It was fantastic, and not something that can happen in a theatre-style venue.

The Commodore attracts all ages, and the crowd can really vary depending on the act on stage. You are always guaranteed a good view of the stage and there're lots of places to chill and escape the bounce of the dance floor.

Considering the close proximity you have to the players, the tickets are reasonably priced. For example, Franz Ferdinand is coming to the Commodore Dec 9, 2008 and tickets are $35. If someone wants to Take Me Out ... I might be free that night.",2008-11-24T22:40:53Z,98
453,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"Best concert venue in Vancouver. Period. No other venue has that personal, reach-out-and-bottle-your-favorite-musician feeling that the Commodore evokes. 

Went to see Les Claypool here the other night, and was reminded why I was so relieved he wasn't playing at the Colosseum or (shudder) GM Place. No in-out privileges is kind of harsh, except that I don't give a shit because I don't smoke.... Having 4 different bars to be ignored at is pretty sweet... Their menu looks pretty good too, although I didn't order anything... (I can just see the Usefuls on this review now.. :p) 

The floor always transforms into a deathly, yet entertaining combo of sticky and slippery by the middle of the opening band, the security guards are kind of retarded (yelling at people for dragging extra chairs to tables, while in the meantime there's about a hundred people smoking on the floor...), and someone had the brilliant insight last time of giving everyone actual glassware for their beers and mixed drinks. During a concert. Brilliant. I don't know how many glasses they lost, but it can't be cheap. Not to mention I'm glad I didn't get smoked in the head by a flying glass during the show. 

But yes, there's nowhere else I'd rather watch a band. Extra star for me being able to watch a metal show and walk out of there without getting stabbed, puked on, or smelling like an ashtray splashed with beer (unlike the 'Balt).",2009-06-28T03:40:41Z,98

Someone always helps themselves to a tip that I otherwise would have given them anyway, by giving me incorrect change, assuming that I won't notice. For this reason I refuse to purchase drinks from the Commodore. Be aware that some of their bartenders are scammers. I would recommend you spend your beer money at a different establishment.",2018-01-18T00:33:56Z,98
459,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"The Commodore Ballroom is easily one of it not the best Live Music Venue in Vancouver. I've attending many shows there and just this past week had the pleasure of producing a show in their space. The Commodore possesses a sort of understated elegance that is somewhat foreign to Vancouver. It's been around since 1929, with a couple of shut down hiatus' along the way and has somehow managed to gracefully maintain it's Art Deco inspired theme even as Granville progresses into... well we all know what Granville Street is!

I'd highly recommend taking in a show here if you get the chance. There's a large dance floor, and multiple level seating that all work together to offer great views of the stage. Another positive for the venue is their door and security staff. In working with them this week I found them to be extremely competent and efficient. They are well versed in large crowds and certainly know how to get a ton of people through their doors as seamlessly as possible. Check it out if you have the chance!",2012-06-14T22:30:14Z,98

The one downside is the last time I went the drink ""special"" was Budweiser for $6, haha... I don't remember ever finding cheap drinks here, but maybe I'm going on the wrong nights.",2013-10-02T23:08:59Z,98

463,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"What: Echo & The Bunnymen
Where: Commodore Ballroom
When: August 6, 2014
Status: undersold
Rating: 2 out of 5

I was mildly disappointed in the show. This is why I didn't jump on the $45 ticket the minute they went on sale. It had nothing to do with Echo and The Bunnymen not being one of my favorite acts but more to do with the fact that there was no magic in the set. 

Their songs still hold up for me, however, you can't teach someone a feeling. It was two original guys and the rest were hired hands. They played the notes as instructed, however, you either have a style or you don't. It's like having a Smith's reunion without Johnny Marr. 

The stage lighting was very simple. They took a lamp from their hotel room and placed it in the corner. That was the extent of their attempt at adding any sort of element to the show. 

Ian for the most part sang really well and was into the show, everyone else just punched in the clock. There was 0 chemistry between each other on stage. The lack of chemistry was very obvious during the major hits. 

The audience were into it to some degree, however, most looked bored while other's tried way too hard to get into it to either justify the ticket cost or to convince themselves that this was a great show. I found myself clock watching more than I normally do. 

It didn't help that the sound mix was way off. Bass was too high, guitar wasn't balanced and the keyboards were washed away in the background, which for most of the hits, are the backbone of the melody. 

I knew this coming into the show which is why I was very adamant on scoring a ticket for cheap. I don't feel that it was a waste of time but I did walk out with a sense of confirmation that some bands are just better in the studio than live.",2014-11-16T21:33:53Z,98
464,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"Wicked venue for music, dancing, people and a an overall good time.  The space is vast, open and intimate at the same time.  Lounges surround the main space with bars on every side.  You can see the main act at every angle and you can always move...sardines aren't welcome here!  Drink line-ups are always on the move and so are the bathroom and ATM line-ups!  Coat check isn't even that bad at the end...try to cut out a lil' early to avoid waiting.  

I've never had a disappointing moment at the Ballroom.  The sound is sweet and the people are just awesome because they're just feeling the positive energy of the place.  

Get there.  Dance the night away.",2009-02-07T04:40:26Z,98
465,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"I can't believe I didn't think to review this place sooner!

The Commodore was one of the highlights of my most recent trip to Vancouver. Maybe it was the fact that I was there to see Apocalyptica (if you aren't aware of them, look them up on youtube, they're a unique act not to be missed), maybe it's the fact that I met the girl I'm now hopelessly in love with within it's walls... but hell, there was something just MAGICAL about this place.

Here in Calgary, it seems like most concert venues (save for the odd one done at a standard bar or night club) are essencially the same thing - four dark, non-attention grabbing walls, a stage, a removable barricade, and maybe a counter for bar service. Nothing special. This is probably a big part of why the Commodore blew me away. It's so original, has so much personality, and frankly is just a BEAUTIFUL room.

Furthermore, the fact that it's located so conveniently in the downtown area (my friend and I walked there in 2 minutes from our hotel which was located in an area I can only describe as 'hotel central', so it's easy to find accomidations nearby, for those attending events from out of town).

Really, I can't say enough about this place. If you haven't been, I'd suggest checking out their upcoming events calendar, finding something you're even just REMOTELY interested in going to, and heading down if for no other reason, than to see one of the greatest venues in (at least) western canada.",2011-04-06T23:35:51Z,98
466,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"The Commodore provides a beautiful harmony of current music with an edge of 1920s style. Despite extensive renovations in 1999, the venue can't escape the grandeur of its pre-Depression high ceilings and balconies.

The dance floor here is worth the admission alone. It's large and directly in front of the stage. In my experience, it's never been overly filled. So you can dance freely, listen to the music, and still see the stage: what a great combo. The black out curtains are excellent too. If a summer show starts at 9pm, you won't see a speck of daylight in the ballroom.

And perhaps best of all is how attractive the Commodore is to great musicians. Throughout the year you can snag tickets at a reasonable price to sell-out acts. But be warned: buy your tickets early or you'll be trolling Craigslist the day of the show.",2008-11-28T20:18:04Z,98
467,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"God, who knew the Commodore had food? Well, I found out when I went to see a show there - possibly the 15th show I'd seen at this popular venue. They don't really have anything vegan-friendly, but those in my group who did order food enjoyed it. The fries were alright.

Of course, more importantly, as a music venue the Commodore is much more well-known. The sound in this place is pretty good, but there are definitely some bad places to watch a show from, and the layout of the venue encourages conversation at the back, which can be really irritating when you're into a band. There are also no ins-and-outs, which results in people smoking INSIDE the venue - gross.

I'll keep going, though. The Commodore is pretty much the only decent 1000-person venue in town, after all.",2011-06-29T19:39:46Z,98

469,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"The Commodore used to be like any other venue, dark, dingy, smokey, stinky, and not fun.

I used to hate going to concerts simply because I'm there to watch a show, but I end up having to deal with drunken idiots and chain smokers.  the cig smoke used to be down to my ankles and I stopped going to shows.  Then they banned smoking.  GREAT, I started going back, just to find out that those smokers were still there, but wait till the lights go out to light up. Damn!  Now, they've cracked down on those morons and I can finally go to a show that is full of decent people, yeah Commodore!  Really, get rid of the smokers, and somehow the crowds just got 99% better, no more rowdy drunks blow'n smoke all over the place ruining the show for everyone. Awesome!

And, now the place looks clean (no, I didn't get down on my hands knees to check the place out, but at least is looks nice now!).  I love the fact that the place has WINDOWS.  Why are so many clubs totally void of daylight?  It seems bizarre to me.  The window shades go down when the shows start and go backup during intermissions - very cool.  I don't want to feel like I'm in some dungeon when I'm at a show (especially when there are not in/out privileges).

There are FOUR bars with one on the upper level, and there is some food served too.  What I'd like to see is a nice organic juice bar -- not all of us drink alcohol you know!!  I also like that there's plenty of elbow room -- I used to be crammed like a sardine in the crowd at the shows, but now it's comfortable, plus, you have options of sitting at a table, or standing back somewhere against the wall on on the upper level -- plenty of options for everyone.

The sound is pretty good, but seems to depend a lot on which band is playing and how they've set up their sound, but for the most part I've stopped standing at the front of the stage since all I can hear up there is heavy base and little or no vocals; I found that moving back to at least halfway on the dance-floor offers better sound.

Not too big; not too small; just right.  Can get a good view of the stage from just about anywhere in the place.  Don't try to walk in with your water-bottle or bag or anything -- they have a forced bag-check and basically won't allow any outside foods or drinks inside.  I did take in my empty bottle and had it filled up inside though.",2011-01-16T04:47:26Z,98

479,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"It is sad that one of the most storied and possibly best live music venues in the Pacific Northwest and the best in Vancouver is ruined by it's unholy union with Live Nation / Ticketmaster. I get that they charge an extra $10 bucks on a ticket out of convenience. Hell who wants to wait in line for a hot show when you can order online. Thus ten bucks is not a bad deal. iut when you walk up to the box office on the eve of the show and they still charge the $10 so Live Nation/Ticketmaster can get their cut, stop telling us the ticket is $25 when it is really $35.
  I understand now why so many artists will not play in this town. The Commodore is a wholly owned entity of Live Nation/Ticketmaster. It is no longer the venue that you see cool smaller acts. It is a money grab.....
  And if I pay that extra friggin charge and want to go outside for a smoke. Let me back in.. I did not get to see my show because of this policy. So I will not give a dime to the Commodore any more.

481,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"The Commodore essentially ruined our trip from the island to see the Mavericks....  We bought tickets through Ticketmaster which had seat numbers on them, so we assumed we had seats and a table.  The doors opened at 7, so we were killing time sitting on a restaurant patio across from the Commodore.  We wondered why there was an ever growing line-up because our tickets had seat numbers, and wandered over to the line going around the block at 6:45.  When we got inside, there were no seats to be had, so we had to stand for almost 3 hours until the Mavericks began!  Commodore staff said only the first 200 people get seats and a table and the capacity is 1000.  They also said we could have reserved a table, but that information is hard to find on their website (I eventually found a reference to that under the Q&A).
I was so mad about the no seats I could have happily left before the Mavericks began, but we were with friends, so I stuck it out - had to go outside for the last 3/4 of an hour though, knowing I would not be allowed back in - the dance floor was so jammed with people standing, you could barely move.
Next problem - once you're inside, you can't leave and come back in (fire regulations they said, which doesn't really make sense because people were smoking in the washrooms), and being a smoker I was practically catatonic after 3 hours of waiting for the Mavericks to start....
So, I will NEVER go to the Commodore again - their website should be clearer about the seating for the first 200 people only, and if Ticketmaster is incorrectly showing seat numbers on tickets (which Commodore staff said they had told them not to do because it's General Admission) they need to fix it or clarify their policy on the Commodore website.

482,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"The Commodore always seems to have as many security guards as patrons on any given night. The mandatory bag check is sort of obnoxious, especially if youre sitting for the event and dont want to have to wait in the huge line of people at the end of the show. The drinks are ridiculously over priced and their mixed drinks are very weak. Since the commodore banned in and out ""privileges"" (it's not a privilege to be able to leave a show and come back when you've paid for it!) people have started smoking cigarettes and pot inside about halfway through any given show, and usually on the dance floor. The crowd always seems stressed about ""having a good time"" and wont dance to the bands, indeed even finding it obnoxious if you choose to. They'd prefer to have their cellphones and cameras out, documenting the show for a later part of their lives when they wont care about seeing said band. The music is often very loud, so meeting people during the concert becomes near impossible, and yet you cant go outside! 

The only redeeming qualities to this place are the bands they book,  the balcony seating, the ventilation, bouncing dance floor, and ticket vending at the location. Otherwise, it's too expensive, intrusive, and confining.",2009-10-07T00:42:14Z,98
483,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"It's a big room. It's even kind of a nice big room. But it's a very corporate big room, and it really turned me off.

I have some problems with this Live Nation-owned venue. Maybe I'm supposed to be used to this by now and maybe complaining about it just makes me the Ghost of Hipsterdom Past, but, nonetheless, I don't like:
- the smell. Nobody else has mentioned it that I see so maybe it was just the night I was there, but it smelled like frat-house basement couch the morning after -- resplendent with spilled beer and powdered cheese dust.
- Budweiser prominently on tap. Really? They're your branding partner, huh? They also have Okanagan Spring taps so I guess I shouldn't hold this against them... but I do.
- the cell-phone carrier logo being projected on the floor and on the TV sets on the walls. I know you're starving here, but I'm really not loving the attempt to monetize my captive eyeballs and all that implies about how much you respect me as a listener.
- Speaking of captive: no in and out? Who does that?
- Also, TVs on the walls! And the projected show calendar, too, with obnoxious trivia questions and everything. Feels like a cheap movie theater.
- the massive service charge on tickets for the privilege of attending a show here. Just to add insult to injury, or what?

If you can get over the mandatory soul check, it's a pretty nice space -- the exposed brickwork is nice; the windows are cool; the stage is pretty visible and there are lots of wide open spaces.

The sound system is fantastic - pushing booming beats throughout the venue. Watching a show there gives you the option of gettin gup close and personal (flying sweat range) or sit up in the balcony area for a better view (read - can actually see what the band is wearing).
They regularly book some hot hot music acts including the most recent show I saw - Die Antwoord.
I had a spectacular time - drinks are of course a bit pricier but that being said - the upstairs bartender suggested that I get a bottle of Heineken rather than draft as it cost less - she was looking out for me!
Bathrooms - avoid the bathrooms near the front door - lineups galore! Instead - head on upstairs and have the whole thing to yourself!
Coat check - once your show ends - the line up can get looooong. But at least they have 4-5 girls working there and a guy at the front directing patrons to the nearest coat check girl. Like the lightup system for cashiers at Winners.

Since it was put under new management, I have found the staff to be unfriendly and insincere.  Every time I have asked for something, be it a drink, or assistance, I felt 'sneered at'. I don't know a better way to put it. 

When I went to see the Sisters of Mercy there, the sound sucked. Talked to management and was told there was nothing to be done. [what? couldn't magmt talk to sound guy?] So I talked to sound guy. He told me that the band wanted the sound a certain way. Sorry, I don't give a rat's tail how the band wants it, *I* and other customers paid to be there and the sound was terrible. 

When Ministry played there, the tickets said doors at 7 pm. That generally means gig at 8, right? Well, apparently the management of the stupid place decided that it was okay to skip the opening act and let Ministry start at 7, which meant that all of us who showed up at 8 got 15 minutes of show for our full ticket price, and no refund. WTF? 

And last night, at a practically full show, the management inexplicably would not open the upstairs for women to use both bathrooms, [they claimed they didn't have enough security for us.  What, are we a bunch of drunken baboons? Or are the men going to come up and start raping and pillaging us?] So at 10 pm there was a ginormous line up at the bathroom. Geez. And they had more security than I have ever seen at any punk gig ever.

The concert area is huge, the decor is nice, and there is a surprising amount of comfortable seating around the perimeter for those who are more interested in listening than getting close to the stage.  Unfortunately, being right in the heart of the Granville club district, there's an abundance of newly minted 19-25s who don't know how to pace themselves, so you'll see a fair bit of out of control drinking and there are no real vegan food options.  The beer list is pretty pedestrian, but at least they have some things on tap.

 It's an iconic and architecturally beautiful venue and many visiting British bands come here to play, I saw the Kaiser Chiefs play here and Franz Ferdinand are playing soon.


 It's one of those places you HAVE to visit, you won't be disappointed!",2008-11-30T21:23:20Z,98
499,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"Went once in 2006 and once in 2007. The difference a year can make. The venue added these giant, somewhat invasive, tv's showing the concert and on occasion the crowd. The place is not Madison Square Garden, it seems a bit unnecessary. Nevertheless, the sound system was good, the bar fixed my drink when I didn't like it (my fault, not theirs) and it is centerally located to a decent part of town. The area (Granville) reminds me loads of San Francisco's Market St, near the Warfield. There was an occasional bum. One in particular got about 2 inches away from my face and started to scream at me, as I told him in a calm assertive (like Cesar Milan) told him to get away from me, he then proceeded to walk away as if nothing had happened. I wasn't shaken up, but my friends were scared shitless.",2009-08-07T07:15:05Z,98
500,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"I love the commodore. I love the old tire filled stage. I love when my feet stick to the floor. I love when i see GWAR once a year and get sprayed with fake alien blood. Commodore is probably the best venue in Vancouver. You can be a jonas brothers fan and feel comfortable watching dayglo abortions from the sideline drinks could drop a little in price, but is that really a shock i could say the same about 95% of bars clubs etc. in Vancouver. This is the place where i have seen at least fifteen concerts all of which are great semi unknown bands that everyone should check out. Other than the cobalt nobody can hold a candle to the commodore.",2013-11-07T04:25:26Z,98
501,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"The commodore is my absolute favourite place for concerts in Vancouver. I have seen 20+ shows here, all of which went off without a hitch. I love how the open floor design allows me to be close to my favourite bands! Definitely watch out for mosh pits at some of the metal/rock shows, they can get quite rowdy. I've gotten my feet stomped on, elbowed in the ribs, crushed by the weight of the crowd pushing towards the stage, had beer spilled on me, etc. But that's not the venue's fault. Staff are all super friendly, bouncers, security guys, waitresses, and bartenders. The only down side is the drinks are quite pricy: It's like $7.50 for a Mike's Hard. But if you can catch a cheap show there, I find it all evens out.",2013-11-10T00:15:51Z,98
502,Commodore Ballroom,3.8,"very nice venue. good lighting, has food.

unfortunately, it takes a long while to leave. and this venue draws a lot of granville street weekend warriors who'd rather chat than listen.",2010-03-29T04:55:15Z,98
