# FitSight: See Further, Grow Faster

## Inspiration

FitSight was inspired by the realization that the fitness industry is not fully leveraging the power of online reviews. Recognizing the need for a unified solution, FitSight aims to empower businesses by providing comprehensive insights from aggregated reviews, helping them understand their competitive landscape and customer sentiment effectively.

## What It Does

FitSight aggregates reviews and comments from platforms like Google, Facebook, and Yelp. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze these reviews and calculate a 'FitScore' - a unique indicator of overall customer sentiment and satisfaction. FitSight offers businesses a dashboard to view all their reviews, actionable insights for improving customer sentiment, and strategies to enhance their FitScore. This score is benchmarked against competitors, providing clear directions on how businesses can improve their competitiveness and customer perception.

## How We Built It

Our development process began with identifying key requirements and the tech stack that would best serve our needs. We utilized Python for NLP, JavaScript for frontend development, and cloud services for scalable data storage and processing. The FitSight platform was iteratively designed and developed by our multidisciplinary team, ensuring a user-friendly interface while maintaining robust backend capabilities for data processing and insight generation.

## Challenges We Ran Into

- Integrating disparate data sources posed technical hurdles, requiring sophisticated algorithms for data cleaning and normalization.
- Crafting an effective NLP model to accurately interpret and analyze sentiment from diverse review texts.
- Ensuring our platform could scale to accommodate growing data volumes while maintaining responsive insights for businesses.

## What We Learned

The journey of creating FitSight taught us the importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration, data integration, NLP, and scalable cloud computing. Engaging with potential users early in the development process emphasized the necessity of a user-centric design, leading to refinements in our platform to better meet the needs of business owners.

## What's Next for FitSight

Looking ahead, we plan to:
- Make the FitScore an industry standard for measuring customer sentiment in the fitness sector.
- Further optimize our algorithm for increased insight accuracy.
- Expand our service offerings to include a B2C customer interface for managing bookings.
- Focus on metrics such as churn rate, engagement with FitScore solutions, customer acquisition rate, and review growth to guide our improvement and expansion efforts.
